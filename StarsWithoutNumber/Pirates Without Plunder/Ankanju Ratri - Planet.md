## World Description

Ankanju Ratri is a warm oceanic world dominated by vast shallow seas, coral atolls, and extensive underwater cave systems. The planet's native Ankanju Ratri people are an amphibious near-human species who have adapted to live primarily in the planet's complex network of underwater limestone caverns and coral reef systems.

### The Ankanju Ratri People

The native population possesses remarkable aquatic adaptations:
- **Dual Respiratory System**: Can breathe both air and water through modified lung-gill structures
- **Enhanced Swimming**: Webbed digits and streamlined physiology for underwater mobility
- **Pressure Adaptation**: Capable of diving to significant depths without technological assistance
- **Bioluminescent Communication**: Subtle skin patterns that glow faintly underwater for silent communication

### Geography & Settlements

**Underwater Cave Networks**: The majority of the population lives in vast limestone cave systems that extend beneath the coral atolls. These natural formations provide:
- Protection from surface storms and predators
- Stable temperatures year-round
- Access to both air-filled chambers and underwater passages
- Rich ecosystems of cave-adapted flora and fauna

**Shallow Atoll Regions**: The Ankanju Ratri spend much of their daily lives in the shallow waters around coral atolls, where they:
- Cultivate sea gardens and kelp farms
- Hunt and gather marine resources
- Trade with occasional surface visitors
- Maintain simple docking platforms for rare off-world contact

**Surface Interaction**: While capable of extended surface activity, most Ankanju Ratri prefer the security and comfort of their aquatic environment. They maintain minimal surface infrastructure, leading to their TL1 classification despite their sophisticated understanding of marine ecology and cave engineering.

### Off-World Presence

The planet's unique ecosystem and amphibious population have attracted:
- **Xenobiologists** studying the dual-adaptation evolutionary path
- **Marine ecologists** researching the coral-cave symbiosis
- **Humanitarian organizations** using the remote location for refugee processing
- **Corporate interests** in the planet's extensive coral-based pharmaceutical compounds

The Ankanju Ratri generally maintain a cautious but tolerant relationship with off-worlders, allowing limited research stations on larger atolls while keeping their primary settlements hidden in the deeper cave networks.
