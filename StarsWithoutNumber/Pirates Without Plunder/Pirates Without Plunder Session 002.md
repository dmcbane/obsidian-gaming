# Pirates Without Plunder Session 002

#pwp #session

## Summary

Continued from Session One following [ Mike (Jimmy Hale)](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) having gotten the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) (soon to be stolen Free Merchant) started. Then comms officer, [Ev\'ee (Mary McBane)](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md), received a message from the [Motinovation](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) fixer, [Aaron Vershin - NPC](Aaron%20Vershin%20-%20NPC.md), congratulating them on having located ["The Assiniboine"](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) (which was renamed to the \"Cambrian\") and transmitted the navigation routes ([](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Making%20Spike%20Drills|"rutters")) and instructions for the delivery of the ship.

After much discussion, the [PWP](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) decided to forgo that option. They eventually figured out how to get the hanger bay doors open and [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) left the Red Sun Trading office and joined the organized chaos of Mythos Spaceport. With a few minutes to catch their breaths, they searched job boards and underground job boards to find a way to earn some credits. See [#Job Opportunites](#Job%20Opportunites) below for the results that they considered. They decided to go with both the [Mining Equipment](#Mike%20's%20Gas%20Giant%20Mining%20Equipment) and the [Black Market](#Eric%20's%20Black%20Market%20Question%20Mark) opportunities.

## Job Opportunites

### Eric\'s Black Market Question Mark

-   Black market vague job moving illegal stuff from near [LS 780 - Black Hole](LS%20780%20-%20Black%20Hole.md)
-   The job is actually something related to transporting a close relative of the head of a [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Megacorps|Megacorp).  This could go one of several ways:
    -   The relative has been kidnapped and our team is being used unwittingly for transport.
    -   The relative is trying to escape the reach of the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Megacorps|Megacorp) and is using the aid of these nobodies because they can't be traced back to them.
- This job actually turned out to be a variant of those listed above.  The relative is actually the heir to the throne of the planetary government of [Dior](Dior%20-%20Planet.md) and [he](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md) is running from his [uncle](Mateus%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md), the Regent of [Dior](Dior%20-%20Planet.md) with the help of his aunt, [Lucia Augusto - NPC](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md).

### Mike\'s Gas Giant Mining Equipment

-   Mining equipment to Gas Giant Mine near [the planet Gunn](Gunn%20-%20Planet.md) 80K cr - what the patron is willing to pay for the equipment 50K cr - new 30K cr - used 120 tons Sandthrower collateral 40K cr to get the Sandthrower 1 month before

### Aaron Vershin\'s Ship Delivery/Drug Deal

-   Never mind...the team didn\'t even consider this option

## Non-Player Characters

### [Long John Silver - NPC](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md)

-   Long John Silver (LJs -- pronounced ell jays) tells the crew the story that he was an orphan who read books to escape. He was particularly drawn to pirate fiction like ***Alistair Renolds\' \"Revenger\"***, ***Nuh Al-Hakam\'s \"Concept of Honor\"*** series, or ***Giorgi Theodora\'s \"Songs of the Deeps\"*** series. He changed his name officially after he discovered an ancient text on the ways called ***\"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson***. LJs\' friends identified with a character called Jim Hawkins but not LJs, he identified with Long John Silver and wanted to get what he was owed. Being an orphan, LJs felt his name was made up and had no meaning, so he officially changed his name to Long John Silver, initials LJS, hence the nickname.
-   LJs has a **concept of using the job boards to find prizes for his pirating**. That\'s how he ended up on the ship with this crew.
-   LJs will be talkative as he strives for acceptance and will be killed during the mission after he\'s had time to blabber his tail (3. above) to everyone and before the party has taken the ship. 
-   600 cr
