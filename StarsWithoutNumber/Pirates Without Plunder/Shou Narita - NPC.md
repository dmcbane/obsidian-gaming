## Shou Narita

#npc #pwp 

An industrial design engineer for [Xenotech](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Xenotech.md) who specializes in producing near [TL5](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/TL5.md) products using readily available [TL4](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/TL4.md) resources, processes, and manufacturing techniques.

[Gobi Johar - NPC](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Gobi%20Johar%20-%20NPC.md) of [Performance Armor](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Performance%20Armor.md) has tried despirately for years to make contact with Shou and to lure him away from [Xenotech](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Xenotech.md).  [Xenotech](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Xenotech.md) is extremely protective of their proprietary information and has employed [GuardianOne](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/GuardianOne.md) to protect it.

Shou has been watched closely for years but has only recently begun to chaff under the microscope of his employer. Following the death of his spouse and the departure of his only child, [Kaneda Narita - NPC](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Kaneda%20Narita%20-%20NPC.md), for boarding school, Shou has started thinking about what the future might hold for him. If someone could present a reasonable plan for extracting him from his current situation, he would seriously consider it.
