## Summary of Last Session
- **Arrival at the Gravity Well Lounge:**  
    After disembarking from the _Merry Mariner_, Ryker looked for a quiet place to hack the black data slabs from his father’s vault. Whiat, unsure of his next steps, followed Ryker and ended up at the same lounge. Ryker began working on the slabs at a table while Whiat played solitaire in the game room.
    
- **PWP Crew's Arrival:**  
    Elias, Benny, Sal, and Leon arrived on the same docking arm and, while searching for a pilot, also went to the Gravity Well Lounge. Elias claimed a prominent table equipped with interactive features. They observed celebratory news of the _Merry Mariner_'s return.
    
- **Security Questioning:**  
    Due to being recorded by an inspector’s body cam (unknown to them), both Ryker and Whiat were flagged as persons of interest. Security located them at the lounge.
    
    - Ryker was taken to the "Conversation Room," not the “Interrogation Room” (which he objected to), and was cleared of suspicion after scans verified his honesty.
        
    - Whiat underwent a similar interview shortly afterward and was also released.
        
- **Pilot Deal & Attack:**  
    Ryker returned and made a deal with Elias to pilot the _Hammurabi_ off Nawzira (details TBD). As Whiat approached the Gravity Well, a station-wide broadcast hijack claimed responsibility for stealing the _Merry Mariner_ to prevent exploitation, criticizing its return.
    
    - A massive explosion followed, detaching the docking arm with both the _Merry Mariner_ and _Cambrian_. The unpiloted _Cambrian_ was set adrift.
        
- **Chaos & Escape:**  
    During the confusion, Elias led the crew to bulk storage, looted supplies (including hibernation drugs, control drugs, ingestive sealant, and a pocket nuke), and teleported everyone back to the _Cambrian_.
    
    - Ryker and Whiat ignored orders to report to security.
        
- **Aftermath:**  
    The crew retrieved the _Hammurabi_ from Nawzira and flew it to Papadoudou, where they sold it to ship broker Carlos Thomas.
    
    - They then decided to return to Nawzira with the goal of locating and breaking into the vault Nico Santero had previously located.

## News

## Concepts for this session

Nawzira was already under lock down due to the attack on their Welcome Center site and the Secondary Welcome site is overwhelmed due to personnel shortages and policy requirements which do not flex well in times of crisis.

Nawzira Central Control is aware of the explosion on Graff 9 but has not implemented any of the measures requested by the station due to internal processes mandated by policy when there is a terrorist attack on a nearby station.  Which turns out to be basically the same thing anyway.

As long as ships are not entering from within the Thora system, i.e. ships coming to Nawzira from Thora Entry Control, Nawzira has no interest in them.

If our team returns to Nawzira, it is one of the safest places they can hide, because no one will look for them there.

## LJS' Departure

[Kartik](Kartik%20Chandan%20-%20NPC.md) has been recalled to [Dior](Dior%20-%20Planet.md) following [Mateus](Mateus%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) death.  He is needed by [Lucia](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) to protect [Rafel](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md) and he is one of the few people that she trusts when she doesn't know who to trust.  He was away when the plot to kill Mateus was executed which lends even more credence to her trust in him from the viewpoint of external observers.

He's leaving since they are already in Calia system and Dior is just a quick hop from Papadoudou.

## What Actually Happened

This session opened with **Kartik Chandan**—whom the crew had known only as **Long John Silver (LJS)**—revealing his true identity to Captain Elias. Kartik informed them that he had been recalled to his homeworld of **Dior** following the death—suspected assassination—of **Regent Mateus Augusto**. In response, **Lucia Augusto**, the Regent’s widow, aunt to the heir Rafael, and head of Dior's intelligence network, summoned Kartik back to help protect the young heir. Until this moment, the crew had been unaware that LJS was actually a covert operative, originally planted aboard the Cambrian during one of their early missions when they unknowingly transported Rafael in cryostasis.

In light of this revelation, the crew briefly discussed the possibility of rebadging the **Cambrian** to avoid unwanted attention. However, Captain Elias ultimately decided it was unnecessary. The crew left the Cambrian in the care of Sal and Benny's family on **Papadoudou**, then booked commercial passage back to **Nawzira**.

Their journey was uneventful, though considerably slowed by heightened security measures. Upon arriving on the frozen world of Nawzira, they posed as tourists, navigating a bewildered customer service agent who eventually sorted out the procedures for civilian visitors. The crew purchased cold-weather gear, were assigned visitor badges and access codes, and received instructions regarding restricted zones and the usage of the Personnel Transport System.

Following a recommendation from the customer service agent, the crew visited Nawzira's only unfrozen lake, a curious tourist attraction. While blending in, they separately encountered **Nico Santero** and **Leroy Jones**. After cautious discussions, all parties agreed to collaborate in their shared objective: locating and opening the mysterious vault.

Intrigued by the lake’s unusual properties, the crew questioned a local tour guide and learned that the raw survey data of the lake was publicly available. Benny secured a copy, and their independent analysis revealed a startling discovery: a spherical object submerged beneath the lake, enveloped by a "water jacket." Notably, the opposite side of the sphere—hidden from public view—appeared to conceal a likely entrance to the vault.

Using this information, the crew located the entrance, managed to reactivate dormant systems, and attempted entry. Despite their efforts, they made no headway—until the vault’s **artificial intelligence guardian** completed its long-delayed boot sequence.

The AI offered assistance, explaining the security protocols required for entry. Although Elias dutifully followed the outlined procedures, he ultimately failed the authentication checks. He argued to the AI that no living person could meet the original security requirements and that they were there to "rescue" the vault. Upon learning the current date and recognizing the unprecedented circumstances, the AI became increasingly agitated but ultimately decided to override protocol and allow access.

The session ended as Elias shot and killed Leroy Jones on the threshold of the vault.
