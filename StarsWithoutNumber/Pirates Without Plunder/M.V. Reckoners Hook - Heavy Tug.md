**Operational Role:**

The Reckoner's Hook serves as the Cygnus Arc Cartel's primary capture and recovery vessel. Originally a legitimate salvage tug, it was heavily modified for criminal operations including ship theft, prisoner transport, and asset recovery. The vessel specializes in immobilizing target ships with its powerful tractor beam, then securing them for transport to Cartel facilities.

**Sample Crew NPCs:**

1. **Captain Dex Mollari** – Former salvage operator turned Cartel enforcer
    
2. **Chief Engineer Kass Veren** – Maintains the complex tractor beam and drone systems
    
3. **Security Chief Tor Grimm** – Oversees prisoner containment and ship security
    
4. **Drone Operator Lin Zhao** – Controls automated defense and boarding drones
    

**Tactical Deployment:**

The Reckoner's Hook typically operates as part of a Cartel interdiction fleet, arriving after faster ships have disabled and contained the target. Its role is to physically secure captured vessels and transport both ships and prisoners to processing facilities. The heavy armor and defensive systems allow it to operate in hostile environments while the tractor beam provides the capability to move ships against their crew's will.
