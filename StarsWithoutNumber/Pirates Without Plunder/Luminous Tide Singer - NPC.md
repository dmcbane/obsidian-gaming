Luminous-Tide-Singer is an [Ankanju Ratri - Planet](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md) native who serves as a guide and cultural liaison for the amphibious species. They are one of the key native allies who can assist the [PCs](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) during the rescue operations when [Cygnus Arc Cartel - Faction](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md) slavers attack the research platforms.

### Background
Born during the spawning season when the reef luminescence reaches its peak intensity, Luminous-Tide-Singer earned their name through their exceptional ability to communicate through bioluminescent patterns. They serve as one of the reef's primary guides for outsiders, having spent decades learning to bridge the gap between land-dweller and water-dweller cultures.

As a young adult, they witnessed the first slaver raids on their people and swore to protect the spawning grounds that are sacred to their species. They have become the reef's primary liaison with sympathetic outsiders, carefully evaluating newcomers to determine if they can be trusted with the secrets of the deep sanctuaries.
