Follow-up Mission: [Encounter - Blacksite Burn](Encounter%20-%20Blacksite%20Burn.md)

## Campaign Context

This encounter follows the player characters' liberation of 188 enslaved villagers from the Aurora Parallax (originally the slave ship operated by Cross Parsec, a Cygnus Arc Cartel subsidiary). The PCs have just departed Ankanju Ratri after returning the freed captives, unaware that the Cartel has been tracking their movements and preparing a response.

## Encounter Overview

**Mission Type:** Cartel Interdiction / Capture Operation  
**Location:** Monterv-Phalcas Trade Corridor, near gas giant *Melides*  
**Timing:** 2-3 hours after departing Ankanju Ratri (Monterv System)  
**Duration:** 6-10 rounds of ship combat, plus potential boarding action

## Narrative Setup

### The Trap Unfolds
As the PCs settle into hyperspace preparations or conduct post-mission debriefs, their sensors detect multiple contacts dropping out of hyperspace in a coordinated ambush pattern. The Cygnus Arc Cartel has been tracking them since their interference with "legitimate salvage operations."

### Opening Transmission
**Captain Vex Korvain** (commanding *Iron Hymn*): *"Aurora Parallax, this is Captain Korvain of Cygnus Arc enforcement. You have interfered with legitimate business operations and liberated valuable corporate assets. Prepare to be boarded for cargo inspection and crew detention. Resistance will be met with appropriate force."*

### The Reveal
If questioned about "legitimate operations":  
**Korvain**: *"Those pods you liberated? Premium labor contracts, legally acquired through proper channels. Cross Parsec has been operating under full corporate charter for years. You've just committed grand theft and corporate sabotage."*

## Environmental Factors

### Melides Gas Giant Environment

## Complications (Roll 1d6)

1. **Equipment Malfunction:** Ion Lance overload damages Glass Widow's systems (-10 HP, weapons offline for 2 rounds)

2. **False Identity:** Merchant ship in area believes Cartel ships are legitimate law enforcement, complicating the situation

3. **Psionic Interference:** Hidden psion among rescued villagers awakens, causing unpredictable mental effects on both sides

4. **Monterv System Authority:** Deep space monitoring station detects the battle and dispatches investigation team (arrives in 1d6+2 rounds, allegiance uncertain)

5. **Internal Sabotage:** Previous damage to Aurora Parallax systems causes critical failure at worst possible moment

6. **Cartel Rivalry:** Second Cartel faction from Phalcas System arrives to claim the prize, creating three-way conflict

- Provide multiple viable tactical solutions
- Build tension through incremental reveals about Cartel capabilities

### Player Agency
- Multiple escape routes and victory conditions
- Opportunities for negotiation or misdirection
- Creative use of ship systems and environment encouraged

### Story Integration
- Connects directly to established campaign elements (rescued villagers, Aurora Parallax history)
- Provides natural progression from previous missions
- Sets up future conflicts with expanded scope and stakes
