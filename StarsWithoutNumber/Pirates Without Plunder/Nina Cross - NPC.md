Dr. Nina Cross is a conditioning specialist working at Depot Helga for the [Cygnus Arc Cartel - Faction](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md). She oversees psychological conditioning and memory modification procedures on prisoners, making them compliant for slave operations or eliminating inconvenient memories of Cartel activities.

### Background
A former psychiatric researcher whose groundbreaking work on memory manipulation was rejected by the academic community as "unethical and dangerous." Blacklisted from legitimate research institutions, she was recruited by corporate interests who appreciated her willingness to push beyond traditional moral boundaries.

Over eight years, she refined her techniques through increasingly questionable contracts before the Cygnus Arc Cartel offered her unlimited subjects and resources. She tells herself she's advancing the field of neuroscience, but deep down knows she's become something monstrous.
