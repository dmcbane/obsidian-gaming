# **Cygnus Arc Cartel Boarding & Security Detachments**
#cygnusarc #pwp

These teams are deployed aboard cartel-aligned pirate and privateer vessels for interdiction, suppression, and asset control. Each team consists of 7–10 operatives, with a veteran-to-rookie ratio of roughly 1:4. Veterans typically act as team leads, handlers, or specialists. Members are drawn from a pool of disgraced military personnel, criminal enforcers, and morally compromised freelancers.
