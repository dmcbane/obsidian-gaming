# Pirates Without Plunder Session Five

## Review
[Sessions One - Four](Pirates%20Without%20Plunder%20Session%20004a.md)

## Definite Future Events
---

-   Whileas the members of [PWP](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), [Ev'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md), and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) were on the station, the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) arrived on the far side of the station and dropped off their marines in preparation for an encounter with [PWP](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md). The [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) then began to move so that it could be outboard of the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) to prevent them from departing, but with the plan to stay out of passive sensor range until the marines were discovered. i.e. their plan is to surprise the team.

## Potential Future Events
---

-   Las Vegas Planet
-   High Tech Cambrian Upgrades
-   Complete Mining Equipment Deliveries
-   Encounter with Motinovation Indrusties (MI) personnel seeking to
    recover the Cambrian
-   Mary\'s character wants to use the money to get the cure for her
    fatal disease

## Additional Notes
---

-   The Cambrian upgrades might be performed by a [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) subsidiary leading to the collision between [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) and [PWP](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md)

## Actual Events
---

[Long John Silver - NPC](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md) detected what might have been a ship approaching [Longa 3 - Space Station](Longa%203%20-%20Space%20Station.md), discussed it with [Michael Jones - PC](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and eventually contacted the rest of the team ([Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md), and [Ev'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) once they realized that there were other people moving on the station. All three fire teams from the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) were searching the station and arrived at the catwalk between the cargo bays and the Cambrian just in time to cut off [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md), and [Ev'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) before they could make it back to the ship.

The fire team to the east arrived first and began firing at [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md). [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) and [Ev'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) continued to run while [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) provided cover fire and both made it to the ship.
