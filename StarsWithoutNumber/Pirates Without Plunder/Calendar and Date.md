# Calendar and Date

#concepts #pwp 

We started on 1/1/3249

Absolutely â€” let's create something that feels _familiar but futuristic_, so it fits _Stars Without Number_ without overwhelming the players.

Hereâ€™s a **proposed calendar** for your setting:

---

### **The Diasporan Standard Calendar (DSC)**

**Background:**  
After the Scream, isolated worlds kept fragmented calendars for centuries. When interstellar travel re-emerged, the surviving powers needed a _common timekeeping system_ for trade, navigation, and diplomacy. Rather than invent something entirely new, they adapted the old Terran system (Earthâ€™s calendar) into a standardized Diasporan calendar â€” efficient, respectful of old traditions, but updated for new realities.

---

### **Core Features:**

- **Year Length:**  
    365 days (Leap year every 4 years adds 1 day, just like today).
    
- **Months:**  
    12 months, just like now, but slightly **renamed** after key events, places, and figures from the Diaspora and the Scream.
    

|Old Month|New Name|Notes|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|January|Primaris|First light, the beginning|
|February|Helior|Named after the lost colony of Helios Prime|
|March|Vennar|After Admiral Venn, famous for preserving humanity during early collapse|
|April|Quenlar|"Quenlar" â€” festival season from old Terran cultures|
|May|Sarenna|"Sarenna" â€” symbol of renewal and rebuilding|
|June|Solance|Derived from "Sol" and "Balance" â€” midyear|
|July|Kiril|Named for Kiril Station, the first station reactivated post-Silence|
|August|Mirador|"Watcher" â€” when navigators celebrated safe jump routes opening|
|September|Aurix|Golden harvest; old agricultural term revived|
|October|Calderis|Named for a volcanic world whose eruption was seen as an omen|
|November|Breval|Cold, "breath of winter" (Breath + Vale)|
|December|Terminus|End of cycle; celebration of survival|

- **Weeks:**  
    7 days per week, keeping the traditional structure (Monday to Sunday).  
    Optional: You could rename weekdays slightly (like _Moonday_, _Solday_, _Starday_) if you want even more flavor.
    
- **Notable Holidays:**
    
    - **Foundersâ€™ Day (Primaris 1st):** Marks the beginning of a new year and honors early colony ships.
        
    - **Day of Silence (Vennar 3rd):** Remembrance of the billions lost during the Scream.
        
    - **Jumpwind Festival (Sarenna 17th):** Marks the theoretical discovery of the first stable Spike Drive jump after the Silence.
        
    - **Concordance (Terminus 30th or 31st):** Celebration of trade pacts and unity across worlds.

### **Example Usage In Play:**

Instead of saying:

> "The pirates attack on September 12th, 3200."

Youâ€™d say:

> "The pirates attacked on Aurix 12th, Cycle 3200."

Instead of "years," people might casually refer to them as **Cycles** â€” emphasizing the resilience of civilization through repeated collapse and rebirth.

---

### **Why This Works for Players:**

- It's **95% familiar** â€” no need to relearn how many days are in a month or how weeks work.
    
- Renaming months and celebrating new holidays gives it **flavor** and **immersion** without confusion.
    
- "Cycle 3200" sounds more _sci-fi_ than just "the year 3200," but not so alien that it disrupts things.
    
- You can drop lore hints about _why_ things are named what they are (e.g., _Kiril Station_ might show up in adventures!).

Would you also like a **small printable calendar sheet** for 3200 Cycle with these names plugged in, that you could hand out or use in play? ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“œ  
(If so, I can make one!)
