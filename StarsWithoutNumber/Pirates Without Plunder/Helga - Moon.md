## Environmental Characteristics

**Atmosphere:** Thin, breathable with filter masks  
**Temperature:** Frigid surface (-40°C average)  
**Gravity:** 0.6 Standard  
**Day Cycle:** 31 standard hours (tidally locked to Corciag)

### Surface Features
- **Ice Crust:** 2-3 kilometer thick permafrost layer covering most of the surface
- **Thermal Vents:** Scattered geothermal sites providing heat and access points
- **Ancient Ruins:** Remnants of failed colony infrastructure, now abandoned for decades
- **Cave Networks:** Extensive natural limestone caverns beneath the ice, some with breathable atmosphere

### Abandoned Colony History
Helga was the site of a mining colony established 60 years ago to extract rare minerals from the moon's core. The operation was abandoned after economic collapse and mysterious accidents that killed most of the colonists. The official records cite "geological instability" but local rumors speak of something unsealed during deep drilling operations.

### Current Status
- **Population:** Officially uninhabited
- **Infrastructure:** Decaying surface installations, some underground facilities remain powered
- **Access Points:** Three main thermal vent sites provide vehicle landing zones
- **Hidden Presence:** Recently, irregular shipping activity suggests someone has been using the moon's isolation

## Tactical Environment

### Surface Operations
- **Sensor Interference:** Ice crystals and thermal vents create -2 to detection rolls
- **Temperature Hazards:** Unprotected exposure causes 1 strain per 10 minutes
- **Unstable Ice:** Certain areas require piloting checks to avoid falling through weak spots
- **Limited Visibility:** Frequent ice storms reduce visual range to 50 meters

### Underground Networks
- **Breathable Atmosphere:** Ancient colony life support systems still function in some areas
- **Thermal Regulation:** Underground areas maintain 5°C temperature
- **Structural Integrity:** Old mining tunnels may collapse (DC 12 Tech check to assess stability)
- **Multiple Levels:** Colony extended 8 levels down into natural cave systems

### Strategic Value
- **Isolation:** Remote location perfect for hidden operations
- **Natural Concealment:** Ice surface hides underground activities from orbital detection
- **Multiple Access Routes:** Various entry points allow for covert insertion and extraction
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Abandoned colony facilities can be repurposed for criminal operations

The moon's combination of natural concealment, existing infrastructure, and strategic location in the Phalcas System makes it an ideal site for Cygnus Arc Cartel operations requiring secrecy and isolation.
