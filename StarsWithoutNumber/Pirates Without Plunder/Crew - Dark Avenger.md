## Marine Dettachment
The marine dettachment on the dark avenger is composed of a squad leader, assistant squad leader, and 3 fire teams when fully deployed.  Mad Eye does not have an appreciation for engagements which require boarding parties so the dettachment is rarely fully deployed and the members are rarely fully trained.
