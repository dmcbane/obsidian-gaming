# Pirates Without Plunder Session Four

## Summary of Planned Events

-   Continued from session three which ended having just attempted to evade a pirate boarding party from [Baum - Refueling Station](Baum%20-%20Refueling%20Station.md) of the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md).
-  [Balder Mad Eye Bucker - NPC](Balder%20Mad%20Eye%20Bucker%20-%20NPC.md) and [Crew - Dark Avenger](Crew%20-%20Dark%20Avenger.md) were to intercept the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md), board her, and retrieve the cryo chamber prior to departure from [LS 780 - Black Hole](LS%20780%20-%20Black%20Hole.md).
-   Since that didn\'t happen, the military presence in [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) will intercept both ships, and we\'ll see where it goes from there...
-   Ships entering the system are tracked as they enter and are placed in a queue for processing in a first come-first served basis. The [Calia Entry Administrative Shuttle](Calia%20Entry%20Administrative%20Shuttle.md) are dispatched to each vessel in turn.
-  [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) comes out of meta-space bearing a different hailing code than when it entered, but joins the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) in the queue as if it were the most normal thing in the world.
-  [Michael Jones - PC](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) has made the trip through this entry point many times and the only thing that has changed from previous transits is that this time the crew is told to stand by to be boarded as part of the arrival processing routine.

# Summary of Actual Events

-   The [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) came out of meta-space at the standard entry point for the [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) system and was immediately instructed to identify themselves and were informed that they were in the queue for entry. -   Fearing that the customs agents would discover the cryo capsule containing [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md), [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) drank the future equivalent of syrup of ipecac and was in the sickbay vomiting when the customs team arrived on board. This caused the lead customs agent to quarantine the vessel until the situation could be assessed.
-   The vessel was searched physically and with scanners and [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md)' ploy worked as the customs agents detected only lifesigns coming from [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md). (They may not have detected them anyway: [Smuggler_s Hold](Smuggler_s%20Hold) & [Custom Pod Similar to Lifeboat](Lifeboats)
-   Elias was eventually transferred to the medical facilities on board the [Hannam - Heavy Frigate](Hannam%20-%20Heavy%20Frigate.md) where someone from [Reannon Quixote - NPC](Reannon%20Quixote%20-%20NPC.md)'s organization warned them that they were going to be misdirected by the pirates [Onon 5 - Space Station](Onon%205%20-%20Space%20Station.md) near [Najaha - Planet](Najaha%20-%20Planet.md) and that they should continue on to [Longa 3 - Space Station](Longa%203%20-%20Space%20Station.md) near [Dior - Planet](Dior%20-%20Planet.md)
-   They completed the drop at [Longa 3 - Space Station](Longa%203%20-%20Space%20Station.md) making a good impression with the potential for future jobs.
