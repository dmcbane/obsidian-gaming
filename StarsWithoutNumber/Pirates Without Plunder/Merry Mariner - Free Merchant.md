A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the standard free merchant A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the standard free merchant is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling significant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while requiring very few hands to operate it. Only one crew member is needed for in-system flight, though spike drills require three for normal margins of safety.

The standard free merchant is not a warship, but its  [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION%20-%20obsidian.md#^starship-weaponry-sandthrower|Sandthrower) is enough to discourage pirate shuttles and the other small or fragile craft that wreckers or primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser is ideal for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out important systems on an attacking vessel, but the ship lacks the armor and durability to stand up to a true warship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a corvette might be threatened by the well aimed guns of a small craft like this.
