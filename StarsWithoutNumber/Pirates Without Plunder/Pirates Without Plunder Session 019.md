## Summary of Last Session

As the session began, **[Nawzira Approach Control](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md)** issued a final warning to the **[R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)**: either vacate orbit or return to an authorized landing site. **[Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md)** bought the team 15 minutes under the pretense of preparing for liftoff. Meanwhile, **[Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md)** teleported back down to the **[Exchange Consulate Escrow Vault](Suns%20Of%20Gold.md#The%20Exchange%20of%20Light)** to rally **[Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md)** and **[Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md)** for extraction.
Inside the vault, the trio prioritized a list of valuable and sensitive items. With a limited number of teleport uses between [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md), they retrieved what they could in a series of quick jumps to the _[Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_. On the final trip, [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) rigged demolition charges in the vault’s foyer and, just before teleporting out, shattered the glass ceiling—allowing the lake above to flood the vault. As the last load materialized aboard the _[Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_, the charges detonated, burying any trace of their intrusion.
[Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) also briefly considered killing **[Nico Santero](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md)**, but the rest of the team talked him down (with some dice-fueled persuasion). Moments later, the _[Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_ departed Nawzira's orbit—barely ahead of the deadline—and set course for the **[Calia System](Calia%20-%20System.md)**.

### Aboard the _[Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_

During the 12-day transit, the crew explored their newly acquired vessel and made disturbing discoveries.

- **[Ryker](Ryker%20Vox%20-%20PC.md)** uncovered the ship’s murky history: originally commissioned by the **Multani Research Group** from **[Melides](Melides%20-%20Planet.md) ([Monterv System](Monterv%20-%20System.md))**, the ship was never delivered. Instead, it was acquired by **Cross Parsec**, a subsidiary of the **[Cygnus Arc Cartel](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md)**.
- **Labs 1–3** were listed as fully equipped for **astrophysics**, **geology**, and **genetics**, labs but instead, each contained **64 cryostasis pods** with minimal interfaces (power and video only).
- In **Lab 3**, one pod had failed. Its occupant—a confused, naked man named **Idowu Young**, a kelp farmer—was found standing in the back of the lab. **Benny** successfully calmed him down and gained his trust.
- Idowu revealed his **entire village had been kidnapped**, confirming the crew’s growing suspicion.
- **[Ryker](Ryker%20Vox%20-%20PC.md)** traced the ship’s nav logs, determining that the **188 pod occupants** (of which 182 survived) were likely taken from **[Ankanju Ratri](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md)** in the [Monterv System](Monterv%20-%20System.md).
- **Lab 4**, initially unidentified, turned out to be a **weapons module**, housing components for multiple ship-mounted systems.

**[Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md)** repaired and optimized the **Spike Drive**, restoring it to **Spike-2** status and repaired an improperly installed **Speed-2 upgrade**. The _[Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_ was now capable of faster and more efficient travel.

After reviewing the evidence and logs, the crew concluded the _[Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_ had been operating as a **slave ship**. The team made the unanimous decision to return the captives to **[Ankanju Ratri](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md)**.

### Further Discoveries: Hidden Weapon Systems
While preparing the ship for future operations, **[Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md)** realized that **Lab 4** contained serious combat capability:

#### Installable Armaments and Other Systems:
- **Multifocal Lasers x3** (Power 5 each / Mass 1 / 1 Hardpoint)
- **Reaper Battery** (Power 4 / Mass 1 / 1 Hardpoint)
- **Plasma Beam** (Power 5 / Mass 1 / 2 Hardpoints)
- **Auxiliary Power Units x3** (+5 Power / Mass 0.5 each)
- **Cargo Hold** (15 tons)
- **Extended Stores** (Mass 1)
- **Fuel Bunkers** (Mass 1)
- **Fuel Scoops** (Mass 1)
- **Hydroponics System** (Mass 2)
- **Ship’s Locker**
- **Survey Sensor Array** (Power 2 / Mass 1)
- **Workshop** (Power 1 / Mass 0.5)
- **Drive-2 Upgrade**
- **Speed-2 Upgrade**
#### Current Ship Load (Post Cryo Pod Removal):
- **Power**: 30 total / 0(3) free
- **Mass**: 13 used / 0(2) free

With the ship’s systems now understood, and the 188 innocent captives returned to their home world—**[PWP](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md)** is ready to sell the _**[R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)**_ before someone comes looking for it.
