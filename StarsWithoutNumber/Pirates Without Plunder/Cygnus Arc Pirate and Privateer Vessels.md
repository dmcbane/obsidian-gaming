# **Cygnus Arc Cartel Pirate & Privateer Vessels**
#cygnusarc 

These ships are the brutal counterpart to the Cartel’s covert slaver fleet. Used for piracy, forced seizure, and cartel-sanctioned privateering, these vessels are heavily armed, well-defended, and capable of either towing captured ships or offloading cargo at blacksite stations. Most operate under false transponder IDs, posing as security contractors, interstellar haulers, or independent salvage teams.

### Pirate Fleet Tactical Doctrines

**1. Hit-and-Hide:**

- Small vessels like _Glass Widow_ execute fast ambushes on isolated targets, disable systems, loot quickly, then disappear into sensor-masked zones.
    
- Bonuses to initiative and evasion during first strike engagements.
    

**2. Capture Priority:**

- All ships aim to disable drives and life support, preserving the hull and cargo.
    
- Boarding parties have prepared scripts to pacify captives before resistance begins.
    

**3. Distributed Spoils:**

- Captured ships are either towed to orbital depots or stripped and dumped in deep space.
    
- Use decoy vessels or decaying orbital stations to store cargo short-term.
    

**4. Overwhelm & Dismantle:**

- _Breaker Chain_ and _Reckoner’s Hook_ coordinate to breach large ships using combined tractor and grapple systems.
    
- Redundant breaches force defenders to split responses, overwhelming internal defenses.
    

**5. Psychological Shock & Awe:**

- _Iron Hymn_ and support ships transmit post-battle messages across systems with distorted cartel branding and victim screams.
    
- Intended to break morale and delay sector response.
