| **Species / Origin**    | Human spacer from the Naras Slip, a grimy orbital transfer station known for moving “paper-clean” cargo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Cartel Rank**         | _Documentarius 3rd-Class_ – the lowest rung of the cartel’s Logistics Bureau, trusted to sign manifests but not to ask questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Job on Nawzira**      | Delivered the **R.V. _Aurora Parallax_** to Docking Arm 6-B, processed the hand-off codes, and disappeared on the next shuttle up-well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Personality**         | Fidgety, eager-to-please, convinced that meticulous paperwork will keep the syndicate’s guns pointed elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Useful Skills (SWN)** | Admin-1, Connect-1, Trade-0, Sneak-0. HP 3, AC 9 (flak vest under a dock-worker jacket).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Quirks & Hooks**      | <ul><li>Collects obsolete port-authority stamps; keeps them in a flip-book he treats like holy relics.</li><li>Owes a favor to a Nawziran customs officer who once “lost” a container for him— leverage for PCs who find out.</li><li>Paranoid that the _Aurora Parallax_ carried something far above his clearance; he’s begun drafting an anonymous tip to planetary security… but hasn’t dared send it.</li></ul> |

**Quick GM Use**

- Slate knows exactly which shell company fronted the docking fees and can reproduce the digital bill of lading from memory (eidetic numbers under stress).
    
- If cornered, he’ll trade that intel for safe passage off-world and a forged exit visa.
    
- A flash-drive hanging on his belt contains the only unedited sensor ping from the _Aurora Parallax_’s final approach—evidence someone powerful might pay handsomely (or kill) to retrieve.
