# Pirates Without Plunder Session One

## Summary

The [players](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) arrived at an office where they met each other and [Aaron Vershin - NPC](Aaron%20Vershin%20-%20NPC.md), the low level functionary, who told them about the job -- return a stolen [Free Merchant](Free%20Merchant), ["The Assiniboine"](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md). Margaret, the [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) administrative assistant brought in to ensure the meeting was successful, suggested that the [characters](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) try the "Blast Furnace", a local dive bar.

At the \"Blast Furnace\", they discovered Edgar Shadi and figured out that he was the one hired to change the codes on ["The Assiniboine"](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md), renaming it to the ["Cambrian"](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md). They followed the drunken Edgar toward his home, got his [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Computing%20Gear|dataslab) with the receipt for the work and location of the ship, broke his kneecaps, tied him up and threw him in a dumpster.

The [PCs](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) entered the Red Sun Trading office (Red Sun Trading is a subsidiary of [MI](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md)), [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) teleporting into the hanger bay an [Ev\'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) and [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) coming through the front door. They picked off all of the security personnel on the premises, retrieved incriminating information on [Kira Motin - NPC](Kira%20Motin%20-%20NPC.md), CEO of [MI](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md), and were able to start the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) in preparation for flying it out of the building. That is where the session ended.
