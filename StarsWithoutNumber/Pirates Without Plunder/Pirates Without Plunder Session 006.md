# Pirates Without Plunder Session Six

## Review

-   Get correct space station from David...[Onon 5 - Space Station](Onon%205%20-%20Space%20Station.md) near [Najaha - Planet](Najaha%20-%20Planet.md)

## Definite Future Events

-   Level up characters
-   Locate a facility to refit the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md)
    -   Unfortunately for our crew, [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md), is heavily invested in the Starship an Space station building industries. Their name comes from the family\'s name of Motin, motivation as in traveling or moving, and innovation which was a big part of the companies focus early on. They are also heavily into pharmaceuticals, cybernetics, mining technologies, and communications technologies.
    -   30% of the companies building star ships and/or space stations in the [Orrello Eta - Sector](Orrello%20Eta%20-%20Sector.md) are subsidiaries of [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) and another 15% have deep ties to [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) through contracts and/or debts. (i.e. 45% of the builders are in with [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md).)
    -   Only 15% of refitters are directly affiliated with [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) (they are more focused on new construction), but many of the refitters are subsidiaries of companies with deep ties to [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) (i.e. another 12% or a total of 27% of refitters are in with [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md).)
    -   If [PWP](PWP.md) has the misfortune of selecting a facility that is associated with [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md), their response will be as follows 2d6:
        -   1: The ship is immediately repossessed
        -   2: [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) is recognized and if PWP doesn't offer a bribe equivalent to at least 1/5th the price of the project, [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) will be notified and will repossess it
        -   3-4: [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) is recognized and [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) will be notified that it was updated 1d6 days after [PWP](PWP.md) takes possession
        -   5-8: [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) is recognized and any reasonable bribe will prevent the facility from notifying [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md)
        -   9-10: [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) is not immediately recognized and the mistake is not caught until 1d6 months after PWP takes possession
        -   11: [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) is not recognized but they know something is wrong and the project will be delayed by 2d6 days unless money exchanges hands
        -   12: write it off and ignore the loss

## Actual Events

-   Took the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) to the [Masters Shipwrights](Masters%20Shipwrights.md) which is affiliated with [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md), but they rolled a 7 on the table which will allow them to pay a bribe to keep [Madhav Gupta - NPC](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md) from notifying [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md)
    -  [Madhav Gupta - NPC](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md) refit project manager - 9 out of 12 - shorter time than expected by 3 days
-   [Performance Armor](Performance%20Armor.md) [Spike Thrower](Ranged%20Weapons)  3d10 dmg - 15/30 range - 600cr cost - magazine 10 rounds - Dex attr - Enc 3 - TL 4
-   [Performance Armor](Performance%20Armor.md) - [Gobi Johar - NPC](Gobi%20Johar%20-%20NPC.md) - potential corporate espionage job to steal [](Common%20Armor%20Varieties#Vestimentum|Vestimentum) technology - [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) invited [Gobi Johar - NPC](Gobi%20Johar%20-%20NPC.md) to the party at the end of the week.
-   Arms Mart - purchase stuff

## Jobs developed at Eric\'s Party

-   [Martis - Planet](Martis%20-%20Planet.md) is the [TL5](TL5) planet in the [Soonoror - System](Soonoror%20-%20System.md) - [Shou Narita - NPC](Shou%20Narita%20-%20NPC.md) for [Xenotech](Xenotech.md) - they have designs for [TL5](TL5)  [](Common%20Armor%20Varieties#Vestimentum|Vestimentum) armor that can be manufactured using [TL4+](TL4+) capabilities at only slightly reduced capabilities
-   Charitable - refugee crisis due to war torn [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) - [Nora Barker - NPC](Nora%20Barker%20-%20NPC.md) - [Flee for Freedom](Flee%20for%20Freedom.md) - transfering refugees to [Salima Teji - Planet](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) in [Teciboe - System](Teciboe%20-%20System.md)
-  [Jibril Hanna - NPC](Jibril%20Hanna%20-%20NPC.md) sold [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) a ring at his party which is actually a security key to a lost pretech facility. It was sold by accident by a bungling and now-dead [Jibril Hanna - NPC](Jibril%20Hanna%20-%20NPC.md) who is a minion of a local [Viktor Stolypin - NPC](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md), who is hot after the [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) to "reclaim" his property. [Viktor Stolypin - NPC](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) will likely wait until after the [PWP](PWP.md) defeats whatever automatic defenses and bots the facility might still support.
-   SHEAR FUN - A microscopic black hole punctures on [Manzi 3 - Research Base](Manzi%203%20-%20Research%20Base.md) above [Papadoudou - Planet](Papadoudou%20-%20Planet.md) an orbital station or starship above the world. Its interaction with the station's artificial grav generators has thrown everything out of whack, and the station's become a minefield of dangerously high or zero grav zones. It's tearing itself apart, and it's going to collapse soon. An Enemy seeks to escape aboard the last lifeboat and to hell with everyone else. Meanwhile, a Friend is trying to save his engineer daughter from the radioactive, grav-unstable engine rooms.
-  [Michael Jones - PC](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md)'s cousin [Emilio Alcazar - NPC](Emilio%20Alcazar%20-%20NPC.md) is responsible for safeguarding his uncle [Mario Salizar - NPC](Mario%20Salizar%20-%20NPC.md)'s cred stick containing his entirement fund to be deposited. [Emilio Alcazar - NPC](Emilio%20Alcazar%20-%20NPC.md) stopped at a coffee shop and dropped the cred stick from his pocket while paying for his order. yet the cred stick is suddenly proven to be a fake. The party must find the real object and the Enemy who stole it or else their Friend will be punished as the thief.
-  [Viktor Stolypin - NPC](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md), an enemy, mistakes [Michael Jones - PC](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) for offworlders who murdered his brother for pay. Think Wilson Fisk as a builder of starship components to the public and crime lord in private.
-  [Ev'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md)'s doctor\'s appointment - complete this transaction offline when Mary has time
