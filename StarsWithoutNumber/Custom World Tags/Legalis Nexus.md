### **Legalis Nexus**

_A sector-spanning bureaucratic and corporate registration center_

**The world is the administrative heart of interstellar corporate legitimacy, legal arbitration, and archival authority.** Every major corporation, noble house, and planetary government files its records here. Operating without a presence on this world is commercial suicide in most of the sector. From the orbital docks down to the deep data vaults beneath the equatorial capital, every structure hums with the quiet energy of filing, indexing, notarizing, and investigating.

The Department of Legal Affairs and the Unified Records Office oversee layers of interconnected databases and labyrinthine legal frameworks, often staffed by posthumans or high-end AIs whose sole purpose is to interpret, enforce, or generate legal code.

Outsiders either dread or worship the place. Some come for legit business; others arrive to bury secrets in red tape, erase evidence via bureaucracy, or forge a corporate existence into reality.

**Things:**

- A null-gel memory crystal containing the only copy of a centuries-old corporate succession agreement
    
- A forged corporate charter with subtle encryption hiding its true origins
    
- An AI paralegal drone that contains 10,000 case precedents… and a kill-switch
    
- A notarized extradition order that applies to someone the party thought was clean

**Places:**

- **The Ascendant Hall** – a cyclopean courthouse that spans five kilometers and rotates slowly to face the capital’s sun at peak noon
    
- **Records Depth 9** – subterranean vaults storing pre-Silence charters and sector-wide treaties
    
- **Registrar’s Spine** – the central AI-run tower coordinating filings across over 1,200 systems
    
- **Form Terminal 17-Beta** – a labyrinthine waiting area where clients have been waiting, living, and sometimes dying for appointments
