## [Previously...](Pirates%20Without%20Plunder%20Session%20008.md)

[Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) was threatened and there was one foiled attempt on this life. [Officer Bruce Willis - NPC](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) and [Officer David Haselhoff - NPC](Officer%20David%20Haselhoff%20-%20NPC.md) arrived at the house and after an extended firefight, [Officer David](Officer%20David%20Haselhoff%20-%20NPC.md)  was dead and [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) was assigned to escort [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) back to the station for questioning. While [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) was being checked out by medical, [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) used his foresight to see that a bomb would go off if [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) started the car.

[Ev'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) teleported to the site to open the door, but when they opened the door the bomber noticed, and decided to blow the car (50/50). We rolled a 12 on the table above which indicated maximum damage.

BLUF: [Ev\'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md), [Mike Jones](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md), and [Heinrich Lenscher (Eric Magnus)](Heinrich%20Lenscher%20-%20PC.md) died instantly - [Officer Bruce Willis](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) was mortally wounded.

Daniel created a new character, [Salizar "Sal" Maroni](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), uncle of Mike Jones (adopted into the family) and father of Jimmy\'s new character, [Benito \"Benny\" Maroni](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md). [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) is an amazing mechanic. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) hired [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) provisionally because he needed a replacement for [Ev\'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) in the role of engineer.

Jimmy created a new character, [Benito "Benny" Maroni](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), cousin of [Mike Jones](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and son of Daniel\'s new character [Salizar "Sal" Maroni](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md). [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) is a politician who Jimmy envisions as a replacement of [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) as the captain of the ship. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) hired [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) provisionally only because he is [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md)\'s son.

Mary created a new character, [Leon Ardo - PC](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md). He is an assassin who [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) kidnapped his brothers and is holding them hostage to force [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) to track down the ones who took their ship. (I may be misremembering the reasoning behind the kidnapping. Ask Mary what she remembers.) [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) hired [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) provisionally because he needed a replacement for [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) in the role of pilot.

[Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) are out for revenge for [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md)\'s death. Leon wants to save his brothers.

## Preparations for the next session
[Pirates Without Plunder Session 009a](Pirates%20Without%20Plunder%20Session%20009a.md)

## Actual session

- The meeting with Viktor went well.
    - [Elias](Elias Merten%20-%20PC.md) asked if they could check the security recordings from [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)'s party so that we might identify the person who [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) purchased the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) key from. The person that he received it from was wearing a concealer suit that was projecting the appearance of some celebrity from the [Leucipp - System](Leucipp%20-%20System.md). That was a dead end.
    - There was discussion surrounding [Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) having established a corporation owning the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) (something between a trust, non-profit, and light-limited corporation in today\'s terms) registered on [Eurynae](Eurynae%20-%20Planet.md) which is the legal center of the sector and as such is legally bullet-proof. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [LJS](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md) to provide the name later.
    - [Viktor](Viktor Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) revealed that they had deposited credits into the company\'s accounts sufficient to fund maintenance for the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) for a year. His concept was for the crew to pursue jobs to support themselves and maintain the ship just as if the funds weren't there, but wanted the crew to have the freedom to select jobs based on their search not because they need the funds.
- [Elias](Elias Merten%20-%20PC.md) decided to accept the following job identified during [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)'s party
    - Charitable - refugee crisis due to war torn [Calia](Calia%20-%20System.md) - [Nora Barker](Nora%20Barker%20-%20NPC.md)
        - Flee for Freedom - transferring refugees to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) in [Teciboe](Teciboe%20-%20System.md)
    - 200 refugees with 240 tons of cargo & people
    - 2 years - 2K credits per person - 400K credits
    - [Kevin Crawford](Kevin Crawford%20-%20NPC.md) is the project lead of the [Flee for Freedom](Flee%20for%20Freedom.md) project to transfer refugees from [Calia](Calia%20-%20System.md) to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) in the [Teciboe](Teciboe%20-%20System.md) system.
	- [Kevin Crawford](Kevin%20Crawford%20-%20NPC.md) and two others died in route
	- One refugee accused another of sleeping with his wife. The insulted party killed the accused and accidentally, [Kevin Crawford](Kevin%20Crawford%20-%20NPC.md).
	- The perpetrator was killed moments later by the other refugees because he killed them.
    - [Elias](Elias Merten%20-%20PC.md) was able to calm them down and now [Echo Danica](Echo%20Danica.md), the wife of the first victim, is serving as the representative for the refugees
    - The crew delivered the refugees to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) where they settled on the uninhabited continent away from the native inhabitant.
    - Following delivery of the refugees, the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) visited the [Oodnadatta 7 - Space Station](Oodnadatta%207%20-%20Space%20Station.md) in hopes of discovering something related to the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) vault. The station was originally established by [Nebula Nexus Research Corp (NNRC)](Nebula%20Nexus%20Research%20Corp%20(NNRC).md) as a research and observation station of the developing planet, but has outlived it\'s usefulness and has basically been abandoned.
    - Scientist, [Sonny Rain](Sonny%20Rain.md), is maintaining the hydroponics on the station even thought it is not his specialty. He remains on the station only because he can\'t get anyone to come transport him off.
    - Administrator, [Samuel Dunce](Samuel%20Dunce.md), is a blowhard who is tremendously proud of running this station and he believes he can bring it back to its former glory. He will resist all attempts to get him to leave the station until he receives the vacate orders from [NNRC](Nebula%20Nexus%20Research%20Corp%20(NNRC).md). Up until now, they haven\'t even responded to his comms.
    - Junior Engineer, [Mike Lord - NPC](Mike%20Lord%20-%20NPC.md) is desperately trying to keep the station running, but is in way over his head. [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) plans to teach him a bit and to recruit him to be the crew\'s main liaison to the station staff.
    - The crew wants to rent part of the station to use as a base of operations in the [Teciboe - System](Teciboe%20-%20System.md).
    - The crew learned that there is a compartment on the station that hasn\'t been opened in a long time and [Dunce](Samuel%20Dunce.md) is hiding information about something that the crew believes to be [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) related.
    - The crew is more interested in the orbital ruin, [Domoni 5 - Orbital Ruin](Domoni%205%20-%20Orbital%20Ruin.md), as a potential resource for clues leading to the location of [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) devices or possibly as a repository of [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) devices.
