# Pirates Without Plunder Session One-Four Review

Previously, our adventurers responded to a job opportunity on [Surita Kawah - Planet](Surita%20Kawah%20-%20Planet.md) in the [Thora - System](Thora%20-%20System.md) where they met with [Aaron Vershin - NPC](Aaron%20Vershin%20-%20NPC.md) to get the details on the job. He told the story of a stolen ship and provided hints to get them started. Following the clues, our adventurers tracked down and recovered the aging but sound Free Merchant vessel, "The Assiniboine." They decided that instead of returning the ship to [Kira Motin - NPC](Kira%20Motin%20-%20NPC.md), the somewhat seedy [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) CEO, they would begin their pirating careers by keeping the ship renaming her the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md). Our adventurers, hereafter referred to as the [PWP](PWP.md), appears to have escaped without pursuit as they set out in search of jobs to keep the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) flying.

After considering several jobs, [PWP](PWP.md) narrowed the list to two; one that allowed them to begin their pirating careers with an air of legitimacy and the other a little more questionable. Using the [Sandthrower](Sandthrower) as collateral, they purchased some well used mining equipment which they delivered to a disappointed [Muhtar Aino - NPC](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md). [Muhtar Aino - NPC](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md) initially rejected the delivery, but kept it after discovering that his first mate, [Miko Suyates - NPC](Miko%20Suyates%20-%20NPC.md), had left the requirement for "new" equipment out of the contract. [Muhtar Aino - NPC](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md) fronted [PWP](PWP.md) enough credits to purchase equipment needed to keep the mining operation going and agreed to take delivery in a month.

Instead of dead-heading back to pick up the mining equipment, [PWP](PWP.md) decided to investigate the other job with the hopes of completing both concurrently. They met with [Reannon Quixote - NPC](Reannon%20Quixote%20-%20NPC.md) to learn that the other job was dangerous and secretive, but with the potential for a huge payout. Of course [PWP](PWP.md) took the job.  [Reannon Quixote - NPC](Reannon%20Quixote%20-%20NPC.md) needed [PWP](PWP.md) to deliver a cryostasis chamber to a location near [Dior - Planet](Dior%20-%20Planet.md) without being discovered. Almost immediately after picking up the cryostasis chamber, the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) was intercepted by the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) and after a harrowing chase which failed to become a battle due to the GM's misreading of the starship combat rules, they eventually eluded the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) and departed the system.

After several carefully caluculated hops, the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) arrived in the [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) system where they encountered vastly more stringent security protocols during entry due to the political upheaval within the system. As they waited to be boarded and searched by customs officials, [PWP](PWP.md) noticed the arrival of the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md), rebadged as the [Adder](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md), in the queue behind them.

Fearing the discovery of the cryostasis chamber during the impending customs inspection, [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), downed the future equivalent of "Syrup of Ipicac" to fake food poisoning and provide a reason for remaining in the med bay with the intent of masking the life signs within their smuggler's hold under the AutoDoc. It worked! The customs crew wanted nothing to do with the unknown disease in the med bay even though our crew insisted it was food poisoning.

While enduring the quarantine and medical procedures in the medical facilities on the [Hannam - Heavy Frigate](Hannam%20-%20Heavy%20Frigate.md), [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) was contacted by [Reannon Quixote - NPC](Reannon%20Quixote%20-%20NPC.md) people to warn them that there was going to be an attempt to redirect them from the rendevous at [Longa 3 - Space Station](Longa%203%20-%20Space%20Station.md) and that the original plans should be kept.

Eventually, ship, crew, and customs officials were cleared and allowed to continue on their way. The [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md) must have cleared customs while the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) and crew were in quarantine as it was not within passive sensor range as the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) departed for [Longa 3 - Space Station](Longa%203%20-%20Space%20Station.md). [Session Four](Pirates%20Without%20Plunder%20Session%20004.md) concluded with [PWP](PWP.md) delivering the chamber, receiving payment, and making a good impression with the implication there may be future jobs for this client.
