### ðŸ”„ Next Development Priorities

Based on PC trajectory and implemented systems:

1. **Ankanju Ratri Cultural Development** - When PCs deliver liberated slaves
2. **Additional Calia World Details** - As political involvement deepens
3. **Corporate Fleet Asset Stats** - When direct military confrontation occurs
4. **Ancient Pretech Systems** - If vault flooding investigation happens
5. **Extended Family Networks** - As Maroni obligations expand

The enhanced locations now provide:
- **Immediate consequences** for past actions
- **Ongoing pressure** requiring PC adaptation
- **Multiple engagement options** for different player preferences
- **Scalable threats** that grow with PC capabilities
- **Interconnected storylines** linking all major locations

This implementation creates a living, reactive universe where every PC action has meaningful consequences while providing rich opportunities for future adventures across multiple story threads.
