## Jibril Hanna

#npc #pwp 

Deceased minion of @[Viktor Stolypin - NPC](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) who sold [Eric Magnus](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Eric%20Magnus.md) a ring which is actually a security key to a lost pretech facility.  At the time that he ran into [Eric Magnus](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Eric%20Magnus.md), Jibril was wearing a [Masquerade Shell](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Masquerade%20Shell.md) while at the party.
He was killed very soon thereafter so we may never know where he got it or what happened to it upon his death.

- TODO: figure out where the [Masquerade Shell](../../../Gaming/StarsWithoutNumber/PiratesWithoutPlunder/Masquerade%20Shell.md) came from and what happened to it if it becomes important
