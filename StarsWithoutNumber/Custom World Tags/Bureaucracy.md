### **BUREAUCRACY**

#custom #world-tag

_A world where layers of regulation, red tape, and official process control every aspect of life._

Everything must be filed, stamped, and approved. Whether it's launching a shuttle, selling fruit, or requesting medical aid, no action escapes the iron net of administration. The bureaucracy here is not merely a government function—it is the government. Officials wield more power through procedure than soldiers do with guns. Careers are made or broken by navigating the system, and data—properly notarized, categorized, and processed—is more dangerous than most weapons.

To the locals, this is normal. To outsiders, it's maddening. Petty administrators can stall interstellar negotiations, and an unfiled form might delay a hospital visit for days. However, those who understand the maze can achieve great things—or conceal dark secrets.

**ENEMIES:**

- Petty officials guarding trivial domains with tyrannical zeal
    
- Internal Affairs auditors rooting out inefficiency (and sometimes settling scores)
    
- Bureaucrat cults who believe the system must be preserved at all costs
    
- Corrupt functionaries selling priority access, permits, or “misfiled” records
    

**FRIENDS:**

- Mid-level clerks who still believe in fairness and justice
    
- Burned-out data archivists with access to forbidden records
    
- Political reformers seeking to simplify or expose the system
    
- Procedural “sorcerers” who manipulate rules like spellcraft

**COMPLICATIONS:**

- A vital file has been misclassified and is now buried deep in an inaccessible department
    
- Someone is using the bureaucracy to “erase” people via legal nullification
    
- A rival faction gained absolute power after exploiting a loophole in planetary bylaws
    
- An ancient set of dormant procedures has unexpectedly reactivated, triggering a cascade of legal chaos

**THINGS:**

- A decades-old requisition form still marked “Pending” but now legally grants enormous authority
    
- A multi-kilogram hardcopy filing encoded in dead languages from before the Silence
    
- A self-updating legal compendium AI whose logic is unraveling
    
- A security badge whose permissions change based on subtle shifts in registry data

**PLACES:**

- **The Protocol Spire** – a kilometer-high tower where rules are written, debated, and coded into law
    
- **Office Hive Delta-6** – miles of office cubicles housing an entire caste of mid-level form processors
    
- **Complaint Processing Node** – a single basement room with a two-decade-long backlog
    
- **The Rulings Garden** – a serene, open-air archive of the world’s most influential precedent cases, read and debated by scholars daily
