## Concepts for the planet 
 * Many sites across the surface which are entrance egress to the subterranean warehouse
 * Each site has an intake side and a discharge side
 * The In Processing node resides is on the intake side of the Welcome Center site which has several nodes of which the welcome center is one
 * The impound yard is part of the much larger staging area node where items are identified, validated organized, and otherwise prepared for intake into the warehouse system 
 * Next, to the impound yard is the holding yard where items that fail validation or are rejected for whatever reason are held.  This has much lower security with respect to items leaving the planet but much higher with respect to going in.


## Post-Heist Consequences
#status-active #heist-aftermath 

### Immediate Response (Current)
- **WOCT Protocol Activated**: Work Order Containment Tag triggered when transport collision moved to #351 in repair queue
- **VIC Protocol Engaged**: Vault Integrity Compromise detected after water breach and explosions
- **Exchange Security Mobilized**: Corporate retrieval teams deployed to recover stolen assets
- **Nawziran Authority Response**: Bureaucratic investigation into security breach at Welcome Center 3

### Active Investigations

#### Exchange Corporate Security
- **Lead Investigator**: [[Elo Vara - Exchange Operative]] - Retrieval specialist tracking stolen vault contents
- **Tracking Methods**: 
  - Nanodust markers on anyone who entered the vault
  - Ship transponder analysis from Welcome Center 3 records
  - Corporate informant networks across shipping lanes
- **Priority Targets**: 
  1. Pretech artifacts (extradimensional object, psychic beacon)
  2. Governor's memory backup (political leverage)
  3. Bioweapon container (security threat)

#### Nawziran Bureau Investigation
- **Status**: Slow bureaucratic process, low priority
- **Focus**: Procedural violations at Welcome Center 3
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks for preliminary report
- **Complications**: Exchange corporate pressure vs. local sovereignty

### Underground Network Changes

#### Security Upgrades
- **New Sensor Grid**: Motion detectors in previously unmonitored maintenance areas
- **Patrol Protocols**: Automated drones now sweep secondary tunnel systems
- **Access Restrictions**: Visitor badge privileges reduced, background checks increased

#### Criminal Response
- **Other Vault Customers**: Demanding access to retrieve their stored items
- **Black Market Activity**: Increased demand for "warehouse maps" and access codes
- **Smuggling Adaptation**: New routes through industrial sections avoiding vault area

### Environmental Developments

#### Vault Site Status
- **Structural Damage**: Water breach expanding, threatening adjacent storage areas
- **Corporate Containment**: Exchange teams attempting damage control
- **Evacuation Zone**: 500m radius around vault declared restricted access

#### Surface Facilities
- **Welcome Center 3**: Under review for security compliance
- **Landing Restrictions**: Enhanced screening for research vessels
- **Weather Impact**: Recent storms complicating recovery operations

### Ongoing Threats

#### Corporate Pursuit
- **Cygnus Arc Involvement**: Ship theft adds criminal pursuit layer
- **Cross Parsec Interest**: Original Aurora Parallax contractors demanding recovery
- **Exchange Bounty**: 50,000 credits for information leading to artifact recovery

#### Authority Response
- **Interstellar Warrants**: Being processed through corporate legal channels
- **Trade Route Monitoring**: Increased inspection frequency on Thora system exits
- **Diplomatic Pressure**: Exchange lobbying other systems for cooperation

### Future Complications

#### Short-term (1-3 sessions)
- Exchange operative teams tracking the Aurora Parallax
- Nanodust marker degradation timeline: 30-45 days
- Corporate legal proceedings against Nawziran authorities

#### Medium-term (4-8 sessions)
- Vault flooding reveals deeper pretech ruins
- Other criminal organizations attempt similar heists
- Regional authority conflicts over jurisdiction

#### Long-term (Campaign level)
- Exchange corporate restructuring of security protocols
- Underground resistance movement formation
- Ancient automated systems awakening due to water intrusion

### Plot Hooks

#### Immediate
- Exchange operatives approach other parties for information about the theft
- Flood damage threatens to awaken something ancient beneath the vault
- Corporate war between Exchange and Cygnus Arc over jurisdiction

#### Ongoing
- Other vault customers hire mercenaries to retrieve their belongings
- Nawziran resistance movement contacts PCs for alliance
- Pretech ruins discovered in flooded areas require exploration/containment
