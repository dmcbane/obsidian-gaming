# Encounter: Not Even the Deeps
## Cygnus Arc Slaver Ambush - Post Departure

#pwp #encounter #cygnusarc 

## Encounter Setup

**Location:** 53 Bahn Asteroid Belt, Monterv System  
**Timing:** 2-3 hours after departing Ankanju Ratri, during transit through asteroid belt  
**Navigation Context:** Aurora Parallax using asteroid belt as cover to avoid detection while traveling to Phalcas System

### The Ambush Setup

The Aurora Parallax is traveling through the 53 Bahn Asteroid Belt to avoid detection by system authorities. This established pirate hunting ground provides cover for both legitimate vessels avoiding attention and criminal operations. The Cygnus Arc Cartel has been tracking the Aurora Parallax using quantum resonance trackers planted during previous encounters, allowing them to predict the ship's route through the asteroid field.

### The Trap Unfolds

- **M.V. Void Talon and M.V. Shadow Strike** (Cygnus Arc Interceptors) emerge from behind large asteroids in a flanking formation around the Aurora Parallax
- Ships appear to have been lying in wait at pre-calculated intercept coordinates among the mining debris
- **M.V. Iron Hymn** (Command Destroyer) emerges from the sensor shadow of a massive asteroid cluster, having used the belt's interference to mask its approach
- **M.V. Silent Harbor** decloaks nearby, having been tracking the Aurora Parallax with advanced stealth systems while broadcasting false mining beacon signals
- **M.V. Lumen's Grace** approaches from the belt's outer edge, moving between asteroid formations with cargo bays ominously empty

### Environmental Advantages

**53 Bahn Asteroid Belt Characteristics:**
- **Pirate Activity:** Known hideout for pirates masquerading as miners creates potential complications
- **Mining Debris:** Scattered equipment and refined ore provide additional cover and hazards
- **Ruptured Rock Peril:** Unstable asteroids release dangerous radiation or toxic gases when damaged
- **Sensor Interference:** Natural electromagnetic fields reduce detection range by 50%
- **Navigation Hazards:** Requires piloting checks to avoid collision with moving debris

## Opening Sequence

### Initial Hail
**Transmission from Iron Hymn:** *"Aurora Parallax, this is Captain Vex Korvain of Cygnus Arc enforcement division. You have interfered with legitimate salvage operations and liberated valuable corporate assets. Your quantum signature has been tracked since departure. Prepare to be boarded for cargo inspection and crew detention."*

### The Tracking Revelation
If questioned about tracking methods:
**Korvain:** *"Did you think we wouldn't notice quantum resonance trackers in your ship's hull plating? Our technical teams are quite thorough during 'humanitarian inspections.'"*

### The Nora Barker Reveal
- If the team mentions Flee for Freedom or questions the "legitimate" claim
- **Korvain:** *"Flee for Freedom? That's rich. You mean our recruitment front? Nora sends her regards - seems you fell for the humanitarian angle perfectly."*
- **Nora's voice crackles over comms from Silent Harbor:** *"Thank you for delivering our inventory to such a convenient collection point. Your humanitarian cover was quite useful. The trackers we installed during your 'supply delivery' worked perfectly."*
