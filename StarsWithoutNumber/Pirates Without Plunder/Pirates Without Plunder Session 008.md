# Pirates Without Plunder Session Eight

## Previously...

-   When the police that the cook had just called arrived too fast, [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) were very careful. [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)
- answered the door and was almost successful bribing the dirty cop ([Officer David](Officer%20David%20Haselhoff%20-%20NPC.md)) when the clean cop ([Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md)) drew his weapon which Elias saw. When he shot at [Officer David](Officer%20David%20Haselhoff%20-%20NPC.md) and missed, [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) shoved [Officer David](Officer%20David%20Haselhoff%20-%20NPC.md) into the house and dove into the bushes calling for backup. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) teleported into the foyer and shot [Officer David](Officer%20David%20Haselhoff%20-%20NPC.md) at point blank range killing him. [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) started calling for help to lure [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) out of hiding, and being the stellar officer of the law that he is, [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) jumped into the foyer attempting to protect [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md). After an extended gun fight, [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) eventually took out [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) which [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) immediately revived after [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) teleported away.
-   Just before the backup forces arrived, [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) followed the cook and maid out onto the beach and killed them. [LJS](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md) arrived on the boat and [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) teleported to the boat.
-   The senior officer on the scene assigned [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) to take [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) down to the police station to take their statements while the rest of the officers examine the scene of the assassination.
-   [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) put [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) into his squad car while he was checked out by the medical personnel on scene.
-   [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) used his foresight to see that when [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) returns to the car and starts it, the car will explode and all goes black. The assumption being that they die.

## Potential outcomes of the bomb going off...

-   2 - The device fails to discharge...it just does nothing. The bomber decided that there were too many cops near the vehicle and the resulting investigation would draw unwanted attention beyond the worth of their deaths.
-   3 - The device goes off but with minimal impact only doing damage to the vehicle and no injuries to personnel in or out of the vehicle.
-   4 - The device goes off with significant damage to the vehicle, and with 1D4 damage to the occupants of the vehicle or anyone within 2 meters.
-   5-9 - The device goes off as expected, doing damage to the vehicle and 1D6 damage to the occupants or anyone within 2 meters. Anyone within 5 meters takes half damage.
-   10 - The device goes off with heavy damage to the vehicle and 1D8 damage to the occupants of the vehicle or anyone within 2 meters. Anyone within 5 meters takes half damage.
-   11 - The device goes off at full planned potential so that anyone within the vehicle is mortally wounded and has the normal 6 turns. Anyone out to 5 meters takes 1D8 damage.
-   12 - The device goes off doing much more damage than planned. All personnel in the vehicle and with 5 meters of the vehicle are killed instantly. Anyone out to 10 meters is mortally wounded and has the normal 6 turns. Anyone out to 20 meters takes 1D8 damage.

## Possible approaches

-   [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) try to convince [Officer Bruce](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) that starting the car will kill them. Use a Talk skill check with a difficulty of 8 if [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) tries to convince him and 10 if [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) does the convincing. ([Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) saved his life).
-   [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) communicate with [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and he teleports back to the house to rescue them from the squad card.
-   [Ev'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) intervenes in some way.
-   [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) calls in his relatives to intervene?

## What happened

BLUF: [Ev\'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md), [Mike Jones](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md), and [Heinrich Lenscher (Eric Magnus)](Heinrich%20Lenscher%20-%20PC.md) died instantly - [Officer Bruce Willis](Officer%20Bruce%20Willis%20-%20NPC.md) was mortally wounded

[Ev\'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) teleported to the site and when they opened the door the bomber noticed, and decided to blow the car (50/50). We rolled a 12 on the table above which indicated maximum damage.

Daniel created a new character, [Salizar "Sal" Maroni](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), uncle of [Mike Jones (adopted into the family)](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and father of Jimmy\'s new character, [Benito \"Benny\" Maroni](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md). [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) is an amazing mechanic. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) hired [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) provisionally because he needed a replacement for [Ev\'ee](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md) in the role of engineer.

Jimmy created a new character, [Benito "Benny" Maroni](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), cousin of [Mike Jones](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) and son of Daniel\'s new character [Salizar "Sal" Maroni](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md). [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) is a politician who Jimmy envisions as a replacement of [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) as the captain of the ship. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) hired [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) provisionally only because he is [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md)\'s son.

Mary created a new character, [Leon Ardo - PC](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md). He is an assassin who [Motinovation Industries (MI)](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) kidnapped his brothers and is holding them hostage to force [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) to track down the ones who took their ship. (I may be misremembering the reasoning behind the kidnapping. Ask Mary what she remembers.) [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) hired [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) provisionally because he needed a replacement for [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md) in the role of pilot.

[Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) are out for revenge for [Mike](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md)\'s death. [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) wants to save his brothers.
