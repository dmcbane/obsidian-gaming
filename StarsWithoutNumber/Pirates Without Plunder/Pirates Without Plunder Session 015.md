## Summary of Last Session

**Whiat (Ethan's character)**  
Whiat was one of three college students who infiltrated a secure facility on [Nawzira](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md) to steal the _Merry Mariner_ and return it to [Graff 9](Graff%209%20-%20Deep%20Space%20Station.md). They were caught and placed in a security holding cell at the staging area node. A power outage—caused by the person who stabbed [Nico Santero](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md)—led security personnel to vacate the area. Ed, another detained student, teleported out of his cell, freed Whiat, and left behind the third unnamed accomplice. They retrieved their cold-weather gear, located the _Merry Mariner_ (still on the pad), and flew it back to [Graff 9](Graff%209%20-%20Deep%20Space%20Station.md) under the cover of the ongoing chaos, using proper protocols to avoid suspicion.

**Ryker (Mike’s character)**  
Ryker was on [Nawzira](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md) investigating his father's hidden research stored in a vault-like facility. He successfully located four high-security data slabs in a deposit box. During a power outage, he was assured safety and waited until power returned. Afterwards, he arranged off-world transport from a lending zone and, by coincidence, boarded the _Merry Mariner_, reuniting with Ed and Whiat for the trip to [Graff 9](Graff%209%20-%20Deep%20Space%20Station.md).

**PWP (the main crew)**  
The crew lifted off from the welcome center site and jumped to the secondary landing zone. They subdued and disguised themselves as ground workers, teleported near the holding area, identified the _Hammerabi_, and re-entered the processing center under false pretenses. Nico made a formal release request while Sal hacked into the system to locate the vault Ryker had accessed. They later discussed extraction plans for the _Hammerabi_ but lacked the piloting skill to remotely launch it. They decided to travel to [Graff 9](Graff%209%20-%20Deep%20Space%20Station.md) to recruit a pilot.

**Back on [Graff 9](Graff%209%20-%20Deep%20Space%20Station.md)**  
Upon arrival, reporters swarmed the _Merry Mariner_. Whiat and Ryker were overwhelmed and tried to slip away. Ed embraced the attention and began telling the story. An inspector boarded to investigate the ship's return. Whiat lied to the inspector, pinning the operation on the third (now-abandoned) student still on [Nawzira](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md). As Whiat and Ryker escaped, the inspector discovered unknown bodies aboard the _Merry Mariner_, prompting the pair to flee—just as the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) docked at [Graff 9](Graff%209%20-%20Deep%20Space%20Station.md). The session ended with the intention for Ryker to overhear PWP seeking a pilot and to volunteer, setting up the next session.

## What actually Happened

They go to the Gravity Well Lounge and sit.

Hibernation Drugs x 2
Control Drugs x2
Ingestive Sealant
Pocket Nuke

To Calia and Papadoudou to sell the Hammurabi Ghora Class Free Merchant to Ship Broker Carlos Thomas

Initially as they walked off the Merry Mariner and went to The Gravity Well Lounge. Ryker was looking for a quiet place to attempt to hack the black slabs that he had picked up from his dad's future equivalent of a safe deposit box. When Whiat  was walking off the Merry Mariner he didn't know where he was wanted to go and, since he was following Ryker down the docking arm, he just kind of continued following him until he also arrived at the Gravity Well Lounge. Once inside Ryker sat down at the table and started hacking on the Black slabs. Whiat initially sat down at a table nearby, then changed his mind and got up and went into the game room and started playing solitaire. Elias, Benny, Sal and Leon all docked on the same modular docking arm as the Merry Mariner and they were looking for a pilot, so their initial thoughts were let's go to a place where people would gather. They also went to the Gravity Well Lounge. Elias walked in, got the biggest, most visible, and audacious table in the bar. The tables in the bar have the ability to extend and retract segments, display interactive entertainment options, news streams, allow access to communications channels, job boards, etc. They saw the news that the Merry Mariner arrived and the ensuing celebration.

The team sat down at the table and ordered food and drinks. The automated attendant came out, explained the tables and their controls, offered to take orders and then explained that you could hold your hand up to call the attendant. You could also just order from the table and automated attendant would bring it out.

 Riker and Whiat were being sought as persons of interest because they walked off of the Merry Mariner and talked to the inspector and the inspector had his body camera running at the time. (He is not required to announce that he has a recording going on the space station so he didn't.) Both Riker and Whiat walked off of the Merry Mariner after talking to the inspector and headed straight to the Gravity Well Lounge so that's where the security officers located them.  They spoke to Riker briefly in the Gravity Well and then took him to the security office where they had a conversation in the Conversation Room, as opposed to the Interrogation Room. Riker had a problem with the name Interrogation Room. They eventually did decided that he didn't have anything to do with what they had discovered on the Merry Mariner as indicated by the scans they were running. They could tell that he was telling the truth and that he had no idea of what they were talking about. 
 Effectively Whiat's questioning was nearly identical only 15 minutes later.
While Whiat was talking to security personnel, Ryker had come back to the Gravity Well and made a deal with Elias to pilot the Hamarabi off of Nawzira for him I honestly don't know what the deal was, so Elias and Ryker will have to fill in those details.
As Whiat was approaching the Gravity Well, someone overrode all broadcast communication streams/channels and declared that they were the ones that had stolen the Christmas Ship, Merry Mariner. They stole the ship to stop the exploitation and that could have been the end of it, but you had to bring it back and that wouldn't do. Now they had to handle it the hard way. Then there was a massive detonation which shook the entire Graff 9 Deep Space Station throwing Whiat to the ground. It was such a massive detonation that it tore the modular docking arm that the Merry Mariner was docked to away from the space station. Unfortunately for our crew, the Cambrian was also on the same docking arm and the only person on board had no pilot skill. The ship is effectively set adrift by the explosion. Elias told everybody to follow him and they ran to bulk storage, broke into a container while the chaos had everyone distracted and everybody grabbed something quickly.  They got Hibernation Drugs x 2, Control Drugs x2, Ingestive Sealant, and a  Pocket Nuke.
Leon and Elias were able to teleport everyone back to the Cambrian with their items and they were able to fly away.  Ryker and Whiat did not report to the security office as instructed.

Our adventurers went down to Nawzira, picked up the Hammurabi and then flew it to Papadoudou where they met with Ship Broker Carlos Thomas to sell the Hammurabi (Ghora class Free Merchant).

The team made the decision that they were gonna go back to Nawzira and were going to try to find the vault and break into it.




Something that the team was not aware of while they were on graph 9 was that the terrorists who had stolen the Christmas ship? were planning on blowing up the Christmas ship if they if it was, if it got back to graph 9 they Their goals were they feel like the Christ. maship was. an exploitive What's the word I'm looking for? Mommy, materialistic Anyway, they were unhappy and they did blow up the Mary Mariner. The roles that the our teamwork rolling were when the when they were telling me when the explosion was gonna happen And then the final role was telling me how big the explosion was gonna be. So if it had been a really terrible role, they could have ended up destroying the entire space station. Fortunately for our group, that was not the case.

While our team was selling the hammer. Robbie on Papa doodoo. They did get in touch with Victor Stolten and They were, they gave him a brief update that, I mean, they were still searching, and then they really hadn't. It only been a month, so he wasn't expecting much. They did ask him about. selling their market. goods that they had just stolen. And he said, yeah, I could. I can get rid of it for you but wouldn't your family connections get you better prices and They agreed that they didn't know what they were thinking. They'd go through the family and affect. ively, they were able to get it. They were able to sell it through the family at pretty close to. like 60% of normal going, you know, normal retail rates. So it was a pretty good deal for them.

Concepts for next session.

We also discussed the fact that we had left Niko Centero on Nazira and cousin Emilio in lockup. So there may be some implications from that when they return to Nazira.
Financial concepts were to have Nikko very unhappy about the situation and that. he turned on the group, but that we'll see how that plays out. Or maybe I use a note better. I'll create a table for his reaction, and then we can just roll against it. Or maybe even use the standard reaction table, but he's going to start out negative cause from his perspective. They took off and left him.
