## Main Entrance

 Usually the main entrance is into a lobby with a secretary/security desk connected to some offices / cubicle farms that will have conference rooms, some storage, a break room/kitchen, bathrooms, and sometimes a cafeteria of sorts which may just have anything from just seating to a fully staffed kitchen. There will be one or more doors on the far end or side(s) of this block that open to the factory floor.
 
## Specialization

 Prior to the factory area there may be some smaller specialized areas, i.e. for mixing chemicals, preparing tooling, part inspection, etc. Some may have kind of overwatch offices on one of the walls (factory area has high ceiling, overwatch has two story or higher offices with windows where a line manager can look out over the floor.), as part of the first set of offices, or in larger factories in the middle of the floor.


## Main Floor

 There will usually be bulk storage, sometimes gated/behind a fence, sometimes just free standing heavy shelving. Larger factories or ones that do a lot of tooling will have their own machine shop.

There is almost always locked doors directly to the factory floor that might get propped open on smoke breaks, and there will be some sort of loading bay to receive freight and have big enough doors to get the machinery in/out, whether it's a truck bay, dock for barges, tether directly to a space stalk, etc. is based on technology level.

On [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION%20-%20obsidian.md#^planetary-tech-level-2|TL2) level worlds, most production equipment would probably be hand operated, with some portion of it being power tools and the rest being hand tools such as wrenches and screwdrivers. [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION%20-%20obsidian.md#^planetary-tech-level-3|TL3) worlds will have computer controlled machinery some operated by a person, some programmed to operate autonomously.

## Comments

Ventilation usually goes to the roof, but getting in by the vents is mostly Hollywood/videogame bullshit, so just rule of fun that to your own taste.

Main Floor Offices are usually pretty similar to the front office portion of the factory, just larger and usually more storage for paper documents/records.

Government offices: mostly fancier offices, but may have stronger security depending on the type of office. Probably have more individual offices vs cubes, might have more specialized storage or display, depending on the type of office.
