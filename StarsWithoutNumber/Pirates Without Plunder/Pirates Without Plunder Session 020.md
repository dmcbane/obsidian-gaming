## Summary of Last Session

### Close Calls and New Opportunities

#### The Great Escape

Things got real intense when the M.V. Silent Harbor and their buddies from the Cygnus Arc Cartel decided to crash the party. Right as you finished dropping off those kidnap victims (good on you for that, by the way), these slavers came swooping down with their jamming tech blazing. Smart move deciding to get the hell out of there when the interference started.

But then things got spicy - someone from the opposing fleet managed to hack into the Aurora Parallax and take control. Thankfully PWP had their wits about them and pulled a classic "turn it off and back on again" move by cutting power to all the externally connected systems (comms, sensors, nav, the works). After what sounds like a properly stressful space battle, you managed to slip away from Captain Vex Korvain and his crew on the Silent Harbor, plus the Iron Hymn and Lumens Grace.

#### Setting Up Shop on Calia

You jumped to Calia and made it through entry control without a hitch. Connected with your contact Madhav Gupta on Papadoudou, who hooked you up with Carlos Thomas to offload that research ship. Smart business move there - the Aurora Parallax served you well but it was time to cash in.

#### Big Plans Brewing

After sealing the deal with Carlos, you laid out quite the ambitious to-do list:

##### The Research Projects:

- Got a computer crunching numbers to see if those ancient star routes from the Exchange Consolate Escrow Vault (ECEV) on Nawzira match up with any modern routes
- Hunting for Pretech vaults from that list you found - seeing if any are in known locations
- Tracking down intel on Cygnus Arc and this "Flee for Freedom Nora Barker" situation
- Searching for that mysterious "Sunken Ocean World" mentioned in the ECEV materials

##### The Big Money Moves:

- Madhav's got to chat with his corporate contacts about that Pretech Spinal Weapon platform nano schematic you scored. If Xenotech's parent company can make sense of it, Madhav and Masters Shipwrights could become the exclusive installers. That's some serious long-term thinking.
- Madhav offered 50k for that crate of ultra dense synthetic diamonds
- Benny's working his luxury connections through Guido Gusepe Han to move some serious merchandise:
    - That shipping crate of "priceless luxury items" (love the irony there) - potential 750k payday
    - Another batch of those ultra dense synthetic diamonds - looking at 150k

#### The Bottom Line

You escaped a nasty situation with the Cygnus Arc slavers, turned a profit on the research ship, and now you're sitting pretty with multiple irons in the fire. Between the ancient star route research, vault hunting, and some potentially massive luxury item sales, you've got plenty to keep busy with. Plus that Pretech weapon schematic could be your ticket to a very lucrative exclusive deal if it pans out.

Not a bad day's work, all things considered!

## Concepts for this session

- [Captain Korvain](Vex%20Korvain%20-%20NPC.md) is not giving up so easily and he used a [QUANTUM TRACKER](Player%20Handout.md#QUANTUM%20TRACKER) to locate the [R.V. Aurora Parallax - Research Ship](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) on [Papadoudou - Planet](Papadoudou%20-%20Planet.md), researched [Carlos Thomas - NPC](Carlos%20Thomas%20-%20NPC.md) and threated him to learn the location of [PCs](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) because [Nora Barker](Nora%20Barker%20-%20NPC.md) is offended by their disruption of her operations and intends to force them to play a role in one of her operations.
  
  The current strife in [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) makes it easier for [Nora](Nora%20Barker%20-%20NPC.md) to conduct slavery operations in the system and the efforts of &lt; fill in a name of the politician &gt; to establish a system wide leadership counsel threatens to undermine that.
  
  She wants the [PCs](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) to help plant her spy/assassin into the leadership counsel meeting on [Dior - Planet](Dior%20-%20Planet.md) because their relationship with [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md), [Lucia Augusto - NPC](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md), and [Kartik Chandan - NPC](Kartik%20Chandan%20-%20NPC.md) lends legitimacy to their role in the meeting.
