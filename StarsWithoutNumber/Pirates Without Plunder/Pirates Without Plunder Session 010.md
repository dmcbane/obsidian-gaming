# Pirates Without Plunder Session Ten

## [Previously...](Pirates%20Without%20Plunder%20Session%20009.md)

-  - The meeting with Viktor went well.
    - [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) asked if they could check the security recordings from [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)'s party so that we might identify the person who [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) purchased the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) key from. The person that he received it from was wearing a concealer suit that was projecting the appearance of some celebrity from the [Leucipp - System](Leucipp%20-%20System.md). That was a dead end.
    - There was discussion surrounding [Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) having established a corporation owning the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) (something between a trust, non-profit, and light-limited corporation in today\'s terms) registered on [Eurynae](Eurynae%20-%20Planet.md) which is the legal center of the sector and as such is legally bullet-proof. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [LJS](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md) to provide the name later.
    - [Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) revealed that they had deposited credits into the company\'s accounts sufficient to fund maintenance for the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) for a year. His concept was for the crew to pursue jobs to support themselves and maintain the ship just as if the funds weren't there, but wanted the crew to have the freedom to select jobs based on their search not because they need the funds.
- [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) decided to accept the following job identified during [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)'s party
    - Charitable - refugee crisis due to war torn [Calia](Calia%20-%20System.md) - [Nora Barker](Nora%20Barker%20-%20NPC.md)
        - Flee for Freedom - transferring refugees to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) in [Teciboe](Teciboe%20-%20System.md)
    - 200 refugees with 240 tons of cargo & people
    - 2 years - 2K credits per person - 400K credits
    - [Kevin Crawford](Kevin%20Crawford%20-%20NPC.md) is the project lead of the [Flee for Freedom](Flee%20for%20Freedom.md) project to transfer refugees from [Calia](Calia%20-%20System.md) to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) in the [Teciboe](Teciboe%20-%20System.md) system.
	- [Kevin Crawford](Kevin%20Crawford%20-%20NPC.md) and two others died in route
	- One refugee accused another of sleeping with his wife. The insulted party killed the accused and accidentally, [Kevin Crawford](Kevin%20Crawford%20-%20NPC.md).
	- The perpetrator was killed moments later by the other refugees because he killed them.
    - [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) was able to calm them down and now [Echo Danica](Echo%20Danica.md), the wife of the first victim, is serving as the representative for the refugees
    - The crew delivered the refugees to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) where they settled on the uninhabited continent away from the native inhabitant.
    - Following delivery of the refugees, the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) visited the [Oodnadatta 7 - Space Station](Oodnadatta%207%20-%20Space%20Station.md) in hopes of discovering something related to the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) vault. The station was originally established by [Nebula Nexus Research Corp (NNRC)](Nebula%20Nexus%20Research%20Corp%20(NNRC).md) as a research and observation station of the developing planet, but has outlived it\'s usefulness and has basically been abandoned.
    - Scientist, [Sonny Rain](Sonny%20Rain.md), is maintaining the hydroponics on the station even thought it is not his specialty. He remains on the station only because he can\'t get anyone to come transport him off.
    - Administrator, [Samuel Dunce](Samuel%20Dunce.md), is a blowhard who is tremendously proud of running this station and he believes he can bring it back to its former glory. He will resist all attempts to get him to leave the station until he receives the vacate orders from [NNRC](Nebula%20Nexus%20Research%20Corp%20(NNRC).md). Up until now, they haven\'t even responded to his comms.
    - Junior Engineer, [Mike Lord - NPC](Mike%20Lord%20-%20NPC.md) is desperately trying to keep the station running, but is in way over his head. [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) plans to teach him a bit and to recruit him to be the crew\'s main liaison to the station staff.
    - The crew wants to rent part of the station to use as a base of operations in the [Teciboe - System](Teciboe%20-%20System.md).
    - The crew learned that there is a compartment on the station that hasn\'t been opened in a long time and [Dunce](Samuel%20Dunce.md) is hiding information about something that the crew believes to be [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) related.
    - The crew is more interested in the orbital ruin, [Domoni 5 - Orbital Ruin](Domoni%205%20-%20Orbital%20Ruin.md), as a potential resource for clues leading to the location of [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) devices or possibly as a repository of [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) devices.

## Possibilities This Session

- [Domoni 5](Domoni%205%20-%20Orbital%20Ruin.md) is an orbital [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) library, but it is the equivalent of a branch library that reaches out to the main branch to pull back information.

12. The Science Behind Spike Drives

-   The Spike Drive is a marvel of technology; it consists of a series of twelve "bells", or counter-rotating super-dense torus rings, to which large amounts of electromagnetism is funnelled; these bells create an enormous magnetic field outside the hull of the ship, actually warping spacetime around it--it is this warping that allows the creation of gravitational wells about the ship, and allows the Spike Drive to function, and also protects the ship from the worst effects of Spike Drive travel. The Spike Drive uses a magnetic field to warp space to the point where it rips, creating a small tunnel that, if the ship is quick enough, the ship can enter. Because of the function of cosmic strings to prevent these rips, they are closed off very quickly, and the ship's Spike Drive allows the riding of this process through the hole in spacetime, in essence allowing a function of M Theory to push them out back into realspace.

-   Along with the bells is a powerful fusion plant, which fuses hydrogen-3 in three neutral beam injection tokamak toruses, which races hydrogen-3 plasma around to cause fusion of the hydrogen atoms into helium. The helium created by the fusion is then recycled into the coolant rods for the tokamaks.

-   Making the bells is the most expensive, time consuming, and dangerous parts of Spike Drive production; it requires a high function fusion generator to fuse heavier elements into a radioactive element called "bikinium" by its inventor, Tiberius Crohn. Bikinium has multiple special properties; for the use of the Spike Drives, its most useful property is the magnetic field produced when running electricity through it, which is the essential element for the use of the Spike Drive, allowing the twisting of space and the entry into metadimensional space, and an apparent velocity in that metadimensional space of 1,873,800 kilometers per second, in reference to real space.

1000\. The Mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

-   Poking around in the configuration settings our team might eventually figure out that the library is attempting to connect to the main library at coordinates outside of the known sector. Also, the symbols on the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) key that the player's have match the design for the main library icon in the libraries configuration files.

-   [Xenotech](Xenotech.md)
    -   [Kyle Amadeu](Kyle%20Amadeu.md) - says
    -   [](Common%20Armor%20Varieties#Vestimentum|Vestimentum) - equivalent of a rechargeable Type A battery built into the armor with a charger installed on the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md)
        -   [](Common%20Armor%20Varieties#Secure%20Clothing|John%20Wick) suit 19 AC

    -   Upgrade to [](Common%20Armor%20Varieties#Storm%20Armor|Storm%20Armor) 20 AC

## What actually happened?
- the players went down to [Salima Teji](Salima%20Teji%20-%20Planet.md) to a bunker on the opposite side of the world from where the refugees are being dropped off.  After investigation for which I've lost the notes, they decided to use the bunker for their own purposes and head back up to the [Oodnadatta 7 - Space Station](Oodnadatta%207%20-%20Space%20Station.md).
