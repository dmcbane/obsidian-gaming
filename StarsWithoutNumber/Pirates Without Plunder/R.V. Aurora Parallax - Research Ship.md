Still relatively uncommon in the Post-Scream galaxy, the Hawking is built by more established interstellar
powers to explore interesting phenomena around them and conduct basic scientific research. The ship uses a
Frigate hull and has multiple laboratories that can be customized for a variety of missions. Since many of the
areas where this ship goes are dangerous, the ship is equipped with Augmented Plating, although it is not
designed to fight.
