## FOREWORDS

This paragraph explains some of the small changes made to the equipment section. The changes are not radical, and are of course optionals.

## Encumbrance (optional rule)

The encumbrance follows the rules listed in the Stars Without Number core rulebook. Equipment marked with a **(m)** can be disassembled into smaller components and assembled again. How many components compose a piece of equipment, and how long it takes to disassemble and reassemble, is at Game Master's discretion.

## Power Required (optional rule)

How many power units the equipment requires to work for 24 hours.

## Suggested Skill (optional rule)

Equipment may require a minimum level of skill to be properly used. The equipment entry will specify the minimum skill required. In addition, the suggested skill may include one or more special actions that the equipment can accomplish using this skill. The Game Master is encouraged to create their own custom effects.

## TL (Technology Level)

The TL, or Technology Level, follows the same principles listed in the Stars Without Number core rulebook. However, the Game Master may find that the technology level for a specific piece of equipment is not of the appropriate technology level and can decide at any moment to change it in order to fit its campaign setting peculiarities.

# ARMORS

## Armor Class

The Armor Class follows the rules listed in the Stars Without Number core rulebook. When a number in parenthesis appears, it represents the Armor value the armor. The number in parenthesis represents the Armor value.

## Encumbrance

The encumbrance follows the rules listed in the Stars Without Number core rulebook. When a number in parenthesis appears, it represents the encumbrance of the armor when worn.


## COMBAT ARMORS

| Armor Type | Armor Class | Cost | Enc. | TL |
| --- | --- | ---:|:---:|:---:|
| Iridium Plate Armor | 18 (3) | 15,000 | 2 | 4 |
| Graphene Layered Armor | 14 | 3,000 | 1 (0) | 4 |
| Polymer Field Armor | 13 | 1,500 | 1 | 3 |
| Titanium Plate Armor | 15 (2) | 2,000 | 3 | 4 |


### Iridium Plate Armor

The iridium plate armor is composed of plates made of special platinum-iridium alloys. This armor confers high protection against most types of attacks, especially against kinetic ammunition and explosions.

However, iridium armor is less effective against weapons that deal charges and laser damage. Iridium plate armors make the wearer clumsy due to their weight, imposing a -1 penalty on all dexterity based skill checks and saving throws.

- **Armor Class** 18 (3). *Armor* 3 against ammo ranged weapons, melee weapons and explosion damage.
- **Cost** 15,000
- **Enc.** 2
- **TL** 5

### Graphene Layered Armor

Graphene layered armors offer good protection while still remaining light and easy to wear, due to their composition. The armor protects the wearer's vitals and articulations without penalizing mobility. The plates that compose the armor are made of many stacked microlayers of graphene which are subsequently bonded during a high-pressure mechanical process. Graphene layered armor grants immunity to piercing and slashing melee weapons of TL 3 or less.

- **Armor Class** 14
- **Cost** 3,000
- **Enc.** 1 (0)
- **TL** 4

### Polymer Field Armor

Polymer field armors are used by security personnel and police forces. Though they may appear obsolete compared to more advanced armors, they are still a good choice when trying to achieve a decent level of protection while still maintaining the wearer's mobility.

- **Armor Class** 13
- **Cost** 1,500
- **Enc.** 1
- **TL** 3

### Titanium Plate Armor

Titanium plate armors were the best choice before the invention of more sophisticated iridium plate armors. They represent a good tradeoff of price, encumbrance and protection. They are still employed by heavy infantry units from factions who cannot afford the more expensive iridium armors. Titanium plate amors make the wearer clumsy due to their weight, thus imposing a -2 penalty on all dexterity based skill checks and saving throws.

- **Armor Class** 15 (2).
- *Armor* 2 against ammo ranged weapons, melee weapons and explosion damage.
- **Cost** 2,000
- **Enc.** 3
- **TL** 4

## *POWERED ARMORS*

Powered armors require an energy source to function. Each entry specifies the power required for each type of power armor, and what device can provide that power. The Stars Without Number core rulebook states that powered armors require a *Power Cell type B* to function. In addition to a *Power Cell type B*, a *Power Cell Trilithium* can be used, and grants twice the operational time.

| Armor Type | Armor Class | Cost | Enc. | TL |
| --- | --- | ---:|:---:|:---:|
| Environmental Suit | 11 | 300 | 1 (0) | 4 |
| Exoskeleton | 13 | 20,000 | 2 (0) | 4 |
| Mimetic Armor | 13 | 5,000 | 1 | 4 |

### Enviromental Suit

This suit allows the wearer to survive in an alien, hostile environments. The Environmental Suit recycles bodily fluids and intravenously administers nutrients. The suit protects the wearer from extreme temperature ranges (-260° / + 1,000°) and extreme atmospheric pressures, including a vacuum. Each standard 24 hours spent wearing the environmental suit adds 1d2 system strain.

- **Power Required** *Power Cell type B* / 168 hours (336 hours with a *Power Cell Trilithium*).
- **Armor Class** 11
- **Cost** 300
- **Enc.** 1 (0)
- **TL** 4

### Exoskeleton

The exoskeleton provides partial protection and enhances the physical abilities of the wearer thanks to a hydraulic system that leverages physical tasks. Movement of the wearer increases by 1d4. The exoskeleton increases both strength and dexterity by 2 points and provides a +2 bonus on Str/Exert skill checks.

- **Power Required.** *Power Cell type B* / 48 hours (96 hours with a *Power Cell Trilithium*).
- **Armor Class** 13
- **Cost** 20,000
- **Enc.** 2 (0)
- **TL** 4

### Mimetic Armor

The mimetic armor grants the wearer superior camouflage thanks to a micro-transmitter made of thousands of optical fibers. The optical fibers can reproduce the surroundings with a high level of accuracy, thus granting the wearer a +4 bonus on all Stealth skill checks even when moving at normal speed. If the wearer moves at half speed, then the bonus increases to +5. If the wearer is standing still, then the bonus increases to +8.

- **Power Required** *Power Cell type B* / 12 hours (24 hours with a *Power Cell Trilithium*).
- **Armor Class** 13
- **Cost** 5,000
- **Enc.** 1
- **TL** 4

# WEAPONS

## Weapons, ammo (optional rule).

If a natural 1 is rolled, then roll an additional d20. If the result is again a natural 1, then the weapon jams. A jammed weapon cannot fire until a Main Action is spent to fix it. After jamming the first time, a weapon will then jam with a natural roll of 1 or 2. In order to avoid the cumulative chance of jamming the weapon, the character must spend a full round fixing the weapon.

## Weapons, charge.

Damage dealt by a charge weapon depends on the type of charge used. Charge weapons multiply the base damage of the charge used depending on the type of weapon. See the weapon description for more details.

## Weapons, laser.

Laser weapons mount *laser crystals* (general equipment – ammunition) that produce additional effects to the base damage. A laser weapon must mount a laser crystal or it will not fire. In environments without a significant atmosphere, laser weapons deal twice the amount of damage as well as have ten times the range. Laser weapons have an integrated *antimatter micro-generator* that recharges the weapon with one round, but the recharge process will only occur during rounds when the laser weapon is not fired.

## Burst mode (\*).

Ranged Weapons that can fire in burst mode gain a bonus on hit and damage rolls, but consume more rounds of ammunition as detailed below:

|  |  | |
| -- | -- | -- |
| *3 rounds* | +1 to hit | +1 damage |
| *6 rounds* | +2 to hit | +2 damage |
| *12 rounds* | +3 to hit | +3 damage |

## Focus Fire (f).

All Laser Weapons can concentrate firepower on a single point, causing serious damage to the target. If the wielder maintains a continuous fire on a single point for the whole round of combat, the focus fire deals additional damage and produces additional effects. Each laser weapon describes what kind of effects the focus fire produces.

## Suppressive fire (#).

Some heavy weapons can employ suppressive fire. Suppressive fire consumes a higher amount of ammunition to automatically hit all targets in the kill zone. However, the damage inflicted to targets is reduced. The damage dealt depends on the amount of ammunition consumed, as described below:

| | |
| -- | -- |
| *Double rounds* | Half damage, evasion saving throw reduces damage to zero. |
| *Triple rounds* | Half damage +1, evasion saving throw with -1 penalty reduces damage to zero. |
| *Quadruple rounds* | Half damage +2, evasion saving throw with -2 penalty reduces damage to zero. |

### Flamethrower

The flamethrower causes 1d6 fire damage in normal range (20 meters) and gains a bonus of +2 to hit rolls, and 3d4 fire damage beyond the normal range (21-50 meters) without suffering penalties on hit rolls. TL 4 or higher armors reduce fire damage to minimum and with a successful Dex/Evasion saving throw the wearer suffers no damage at all. TL 3 armors reduce damage to half, but if they are composed of flammable compounds like carbon or graphene fibers they may be damaged. The flamethrower consumes hydrocarbons that, depending on the specific model of flamethrower, can come in the form of liquid or gel.

### Grenade, chemical

Chemical grenades release a toxic gas that, when inhaled, affect the central nervous system and prevent bioelectric impulses from working properly. The target must make a Con/Physical saving throw or die within 30 minutes. If the saving throw fails, the target dies in 5 minutes or less. A target treated with *Antitoxin*, *Medkit* or *Field Emergency Kit* can make a new saving throw every minute to resist the effects.

### Grenade, incendiary

Incendiary grenades contain flammable chemical compounds. All targets within 3 meters of the explosion automatically suffer 1d6 points of fire damage. The subsequent round, each target affected by the explosion can make an Evasion saving throw to quench the fire or suffer an additional 1d6 fire damage. If the first saving throw fails, the targets are entitled a new saving throw with a -1 penalty, failing again means taking additional 1d6+1 fire damage. This process continues every round, each round damage increases by +1 and the penalty on the saving throw adds a -1 until a successful saving throw quenches the fire or the target chars to the bone.

### Grenade, smoke

Smoke grenades release a colored gas that blocks sight and thus offers some protection against ranged attacks. The gas disperses in 1 minute under standard circumstances and occupies a total area of 15 x 15 meter (the shape of the cloud can be adjusted according to the terrain). If there is no atmosphere, the gas lasts for 1d4 rounds before dissipating.

### Plasmathrower

The plasmathrower causes 3d6 heat damage by heating up noble gases like xenon, helium and argon. The gases are compressed and preserved as a semisolid gel inside a tank that fuel the weapon. The plasmathrower gains a bonus of +2 to hit rolls in normal range (20 meters), and suffers no penalties on hit rolls in on ranges beyond normal (21-40 meters). TL 3 armors offer no protection against the plasmathrower, and if they are composed by flammable compounds like carbon or grapheme fibers they are destroyed. TL 4 armors reduce damage to half. The plasmathrower heats the preserved gases and turns them into plasma by means of an *Antimatter Microgenerator* integrated with the weapon.

### Rifle, gauss

Gauss rifles can fire both Ammo and Charge type ammunitons, but each magazine can contain one type of ammunition. When firing beyond the standard range it suffers only a -1 penalty on hit rolls. If the attack roll scores a natural 20, the weapon deals maximum damage. The Gauss rifle can overcharge the electromagnetic rail that fires the ammunition to deal more damage and increase the range. Overcharging the gauss rifle requires one full round and there is a 10% chance that the procedure fails. If the overcharge is successful, then the weapon deals 1d6 additional damage and increases the range by 50%. If the overcharge fails, then the weapon discharges the electromagnetic energy and can not be fired that round. The electromagnetic discharge due to the failed overcharge procedure produces the same effect of an *EMP Grenade* but without dealing any physical damage.

### Rifle, sonic

The sonic rifle produces a sonic wave that can deafen and stun the targets. In addition, it creates a kinetic wave that can displace the targets by 1d4 meters. In environments with no atmosphere, the sonic rifle is useless. The sonic rifle produces a wave that extends from the weapon with a width of 45°. Targets under total cover suffer the deafened condition, but are not displaced by the sonic wave.

### Prosthetic Heart

The prosthetic heart provides superior resistances when performing exhausting physical activities. The subject adds +1 to any Con/Exert skill check. If a subject with a prosthetic heart receives damage, during the next round the prosthetic heart can reduce the bleeding by slowing their heart rhythm. This reduces the damage taken by 1 and can only be used once per scene.

- **System Strain** 1
- **Cost** 10,000
- **TL** 4

### Prosthetic Lungs

Prosthetic lungs grant the subject the ability to breathe in atmospheres with lower densities (up to 25%) than standard and can filter atmospheres that contain toxic chemicals in gaseous states.

Breathing in atmospheres with densities lower than 25% of standard requires a Con/ Physical skill check every hour. If the saving throw is successful, then the metabolism resists the physical stress. If the saving throw fails, then the subject adds 1 point of system strain. In addition, the prosthetic lungs can store a small reserve of breathable air that lasts 1 minute per constitution score.

### Prosthetic Skeleton

The prosthetic skeleton replaces the biological skeleton with an inert titanium alloy. The surgery takes one week to complete, and at the end of the surgery the subject must make a successful Con/Physical saving throw or lose 1 point of constitution. Failing the saving throw does not imply the failure of the surgery. After the surgery, the subject must rest for 2 weeks and undergo a 2 weeks rehabilitation therapy.

The prosthetic skeleton produces the following effects:

1) The weight of the subject increases by 50%.
2) The muscular system adapts to the new skeleton thus allowing the subject to raise its strength by three points. The subject can gain one point of strength every year, provided he undergoes intensive training. At Game Master discretion the intensive training can be considered as downtime activity.
3) The subject's armor class increases by one point.
4) The subject gains Armor 2 against bludgeoning melee weapons.
