## Notes to Remember
* Long John Silver (LJs -- pronounced ell jays) tells the crew the story that he was an orphan who read books to escape. He was particularly drawn to pirate fiction like ***Alistair Renolds\' \"Revenger\"***, ***Nuh Al-Hakam\'s \"Concept of Honor\"*** series, or ***Giorgi Theodora\'s \"Songs of the Deeps\"*** series. He changed his name officially after he discovered an ancient text on the ways called ***\"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson***. LJs\' friends identified with a character called Jim Hawkins but not LJs, he identified with Long John Silver and wanted to get what he was owed. Being an orphan, LJs felt his name was made up and had no meaning, so he officially changed his name to Long John Silver, initials LJS, hence the nickname.
-   LJs has a **concept of using the job boards to find prizes for his pirating**. That\'s how he ended up on the ship with this crew.
-   LJs will be talkative as he strives for acceptance and will be killed during the mission after he\'s had time to blabber his tail (3. above) to everyone and before the party has taken the ship.
* Kartik Chandan is a spy master working for [Lucia Augusto - NPC](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) and he is known to the player characters as Long John Silver and goes by LJs (ell-jays).
* [Lucia Augusto - NPC](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) hired Kartik to find out whether or not her husband, [Mateus Augusto - NPC](Mateus%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md), was trying to prevent her nephew, [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md), from taking the throne.

### **Kartik Chandan**

_Agent of the Hidden Directorate_  
_Embedded Operative (Alias varies by mission)_

**Background:**  
Born on the industrial moon of Vadera Prime, Kartik was orphaned during a corporate uprising and later caught the attention of one of Lucia Augustoโs recruiters. Trained from adolescence within the Directorate, Kartik became a master infiltratorโequal parts spy, saboteur, and occasional assassin.

Lucia personally shaped his career, teaching him loyalty not to a person or an ideology, but to Dior itselfโor at least her vision of it. To Kartik, the Directorate is family, and Lucia is a second mother.

However, his years undercover have made him _restless_ and _existentially hollow_โalways wondering if the life he lives is his own, or merely another mask he has worn too long.

---

**Personality:**

- Quietly intense; speaks little but observes everything.
    
- Haunted but controlled; his emotions are buried so deep even he barely feels them.
    
- Fiercely loyal to Lucia but increasingly curious about Rafaelโs vision for a freer Dior.
    
- Skilled at navigating moral ambiguity but sometimes wonders what he has become.
    

---

**Skills and Abilities:**

- **Undercover Work:** Changes identities flawlessly; can embed himself into almost any environment.
    
- **Espionage Tradecraft:** Expert at surveillance, counter-surveillance, cryptography, and sabotage.
    
- **Close-Quarters Combat:** Trained to incapacitate quickly and lethally.
    
- **Psychological Operations:** Can manipulate and "turn" targets over long operations.
    

---

**Appearance:**

- Early 30s, wiry build, sharp black hair usually cropped short.
    
- Dark eyes that seem too tired for his youth.
    
- Favors inconspicuous clothing; no identifying marks except a thin scar along his right collarbone (a memento from his first failed mission).
    

---

**Relationship to Lucia Augusto:**

- Deep-seated loyalty mixed with hints of unspoken resentment.
    
- Views her as both savior and manipulator.
    

**Relationship to Rafael Rosa:**

- Has watched Rafael from the shadows; admires his idealism but doubts his ability to survive in Diorโs brutal world.
    
- Secretly wonders if Rafael might be the kind of king Dior needsโand if so, whether it is Kartikโs duty to _protect_ him, _manipulate_ him, or _abandon_ him when the time comes.
