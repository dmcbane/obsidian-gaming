## Player Handouts

### Facility Intel (From Dr. Kellerman)
*"The facility has eight levels going down. Top two are admin and security - that's where they'll have the most guards. Middle levels are where they... process people. The screaming never stops. Bottom levels have the prisoners who might survive. Infrastructure's at the very bottom - power, life support, and the furnaces where they burn the evidence."*

*"Guards change shift every 6 hours. Best window is during shift change - about 15 minutes of confusion. They use thermal vents for access, but there's an old mine shaft they think is sealed. Torrino runs everything from the command center. He's paranoid, ex-military, never leaves anything to chance."*

### Prisoner List (Partial)
- **Confirmed:** Your captured crew members
- **High Value:** Maria Santos (journalist), David Kim (accountant)
- **Political:** Janet Morrison (union leader)
- **Unknown:** 15-20 others, conditions unknown
- **Risk:** Some may be conditioned to fight rescuers

### Success Metrics
**Minimum Success:** Rescue your crew
**Standard Success:** Rescue your crew + high-value targets
**Optimal Success:** Everyone rescued + evidence secured
**Perfect Success:** Above + Torrino captured + facility intact for investigation
