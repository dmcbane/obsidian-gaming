## INTRODUCTION

The *Stars Without Number* science fiction role-playing game has a wonderfully simple starship design process based on installing Fittings into a few standard hull types. The core rulebook provides all the details to design most ships and *Skyward Steel*, the naval supplement, provides additional hull forms and fitting types, but the books lack a comprehensive list of basic ship designs for quick use by a GM or players. Given the assumed setting of most SWN games, it isn't surprising that standard ship designs would not be common. Each world or small interstellar state would most likely have unique designs that meet their unique needs. However, we have found that it is often a lot easier to have some basic designs to start with that can be modified to fit a given situation rather than designing each ship from scratch every time. *Skyward Steel* provides some standard ship designs, but those are primarily of a military nature. There are essentially no civilian designs for starships for SWN. This book hopes to help solve this problem.

During the design of these civilian ships, there were several additional Fittings that we felt would have helped us, so below the designs you will find a list of new Fittings, aimed at Civilian ships such as would be used by player characters. This product also details six "standard" ship designs created using the core rulebook and *Skyward Steel*; additionally, there are six ship designs including new Fittings defined in this publication.

### Required Materials

To get the most from this book you will need at least two dice of various sides and some pens/pencils and paper or a computer.

### **Book Overview**

This book is divided into three main sections. The first section includes six new civilian ship designs for use in any SWN game. These ships were all built using only the published rules in the main *SWN* rulebook and in the naval supplement *Skyward Steel*. The Build Point cost to produce these ships as well as the annual BP cost to maintain these ships has been included for reference; BP costs are explained in detail starting on *SS 53*.

The second section contains new fittings that can be used on any SWN starship. These new Fittings are designed primarily for use with civilian ships, although they certainly can have uses aboard a military vessel. Use of these fittings is completely optional.

The final section contains six new ship designs that incorporate some of the new fittings detailed in this book.

Some of the information in this book appeared in the free fanzine *Infinite Stars*. The information in this book is an update and expansion of those rules. If there is any conflict between the rules presented in that fanzine and this book, the rules in this book should be used.

## STARSHIP OPERATION COSTS

The SWN core rulebook has instructions for calculating the operating costs of a starship (*SWN 70*). Unfortunately, the rules are a bit unclear as to how to convert those calculations into the monthly operating costs listed in the ship design form. This section clarifies those instructions, but does not change the actual rules. For all of these calculations, it is assumed that a month is 30 days long and there are 12 months in a year.

To calculate the total operating costs per month, sum the Payroll, Stores and Maintenance costs.

### Making Payroll

Monthly payroll costs are determined based on crew size. For civilian ships, it can usually be assumed that the minimum crew size listed for the hull form will be used. For military ships (or paramilitary ships), the largest capacity should be used. On civilian ships, the difference between the actual crew size and maximum crew capacity is the number of possible passengers.

Monthly payroll can be calculated using the following formula:

- **Payroll Cr. Per month = 3,000 * Crew Size** (not including passengers)

### Ship Stores

Ship stores are calculated based on the maximum crew capacity of the hull, including passengers. Note: Cold Sleep pod passengers do not use Ship Stores. To calculate the monthly ship's stores cost use the following formula:

- **Stores Cr. Per month = 600 * Max Crew Size** (including passengers)

Standard storage requires these stores to be replenished twice per month at a cost of ½ of the listed value. If the Extended Life Support Fitting is purchased, then the cost is only paid once per month. If the Hydroponics Production Fitting is selected, the Stores cost is *zero*.

### Maintenance

Things break. The formula given in the core rulebook calculates the cost per year. To calculate the monthly maintenance cost, use the following formula:

- **Maintenance Cr. per month = 0.00417 * Total Cost** (final purchase price)

The original SWN rulebook had an error in calculating the maintenance costs by stating that costs should be calculated using the base hull cost of the ship. The formula presented above is the correct formula that should be used and has been confirmed by the author of *Stars Without Number* and should be considered an Official Rule.

### Refueling

After each drill, a ship must be refueled, unless it has the Fuel Bunkers. Fuel Scoops allow the ship to refuel for free at a star or gas giant, but takes four days. Buying fuel from a station costs Cr. 100 per Drive Rating and takes as little as six hours. Use the following table cross-referencing the hull size and the Drive rating of the ship. Note, these are standard prices and the GM is free to adjust them up or down depending on World Tags or other factors as desired.

| Hull Size | Drive-1 | Drive-2 | Drive-3 | Drive-4 | Drive-5 | Drive-6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fighter | Cr. 100 | Cr, 200 | Cr. 300 | Cr. 400 | Cr. 500 | Cr. 600 |
| Frigate | Cr. 200 | Cr. 400 | Cr. 600 | Cr. 800 | Cr. 1,000 | Cr. 1,200 |
| Cruiser | Cr. 400 | Cr. 800 | Cr. 1,200 | Cr. 1,600 | Cr. 2,000 | Cr. 2,400 |
| Capital | Cr. 800 | Cr. 1,600 | Cr. 2,400 | Cr. 3,200 | Cr. 4,000 | Cr. 4,800 |

Ships with Fuel Bunkers must pay double the amount listed to fill both the standard tanks and the bunkers. Ships with Reduced Fuel Bunkers pay 10% of the listed amount. Reduced Fuel Bunkers are detailed below.

### Build Points

Build Points (BP) are an abstract way to track a planetary navy's budget in a grand scale. Build Points discussed in *Skyward Steel* (*SS 53*). Although designed specifically for military budgets, large interstellar corporations use a similar system to track their merchant marine fleets. Thus the BP cost and yearly costs are included in all designs in this book. If the GM is not using fleet budgets, this data can be ignored. The table provided on SS 54 only works for the basic designs and does not include all the possible Fitting options.

To calculate the Purchase BP cost of a ship use the following formula:

- **Purchase BP = Total Ship Cost / 200,000** (normal rounding)

Annual Maintenance BP costs are calculated using the following formula:

- **Annual Maintenance BP = 0.1 * Purchase BP** (normal rounding)

Note: Fighter-class hulls have no annual Maintenance BP costs.

Annual crew costs are usually the largest single cost on most ships. The crew cost includes payroll and stores costs combined together, as such even Passengers are counted within the "crew" costs. As with the Stores cost above, Cold Sleep pods do not require crew costs. Annual crew costs are calculated as follows:

- **Annual Crew BP = 0.1 * Maximum Capacity** (round up)

The total annual BP cost is the sum of the Maintenance and the Crew BP costs.

### Optional Rule: Frugal Civilian Ship Maintenance

As discussed in *Skyward Steel*, use of the BP costs for a non-military campaign will often produce unrealistically high annual BP costs since civilian ships tend to operate with smaller crews and cut costs wherever possible. It is strongly recommended that for non-Military ships, the calculated annual BP cost should be cut in half (rounded down) to more accurately reflect these cost-cutting efforts (minimum of 1 BP). Note that the formulas above *do not* include this recommended discount, nor do the sample ships provided in this book.

## STARSHIP DESIGNS

While there are several ship designs provided on *SWN 198*, the number of civilian ship designs was limited. *Skyward Steel* concentrates on military ship designs and even *Suns of Gold* does not include merchant ship designs. The following civilian ship designs are presented as examples for use in almost any *SWN* setting:

### Ghora-Class Free Merchant

|  |  |  |  | Power: | 10/1 free |  |  | Mass: | 15/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): | 825,000 | HP: | 20 | Crew: | 1/12 | Speed: | 3 | Armor: | 2 | AC: | 6 |
| Hull Size: | Frigate |  |  | Hull Form: | Free Merchant |  |  | BP Cost: | 4 | BP Annual: | 2 |
| Weaponry | Sandthrower (2d4, Flak), [1 free Hardpoint] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | None |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings | Atmospheric Configuration, Cargo Spacex5 (100 tons), Drive-2 Upgrade, Extended Life Support, Fuel Scoops, Lifeboats |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Operating Cost |  |  | Cr. 22,640 per Mo.; Pay: 12,000; Stores: 7,200; Maint: 3,440 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The *Ghora*-Class Free Merchant is common throughout the galaxy. The design is based on a typical oldstyle small merchant design and thus has been duplicated independently just about everywhere. The *Ghora* operates with a standard crew of four: Pilot, Navigator, Gunner/Security and Steward/Medic and can carry 8 passengers and 80 tons of cargo.

### Elephant-Class Bulk Freighter

|  |  |  | Power: | 15/6 free |  |  | Mass: | 25/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): 5,762,500 | HP: | 40 | Crew: | 10/80 | Speed: | 0 | Armor: | 0 | AC: | 9 |
| Hull Size: Cruiser |  |  | Hull Form: | Bulk Freighter |  |  | BP Cost: | 29 | BP Annual: | 8 |
| Weaponry | None [2 free Hardpoints] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses None |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings |  |  |  |  | Advanced Nav Computer, Cargo Lighter, Cargo Space x16 (3,200 tons), Drive-2 Upgrade, Extended Life Support, Lifeboats, Ship's Locker |  |  |  |  |  |
| Operating Cost |  |  | Cr. 102,030 per Month: Payroll: 30,000, Stores: 48,000, Maint: 24,030 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The *Elephant*-Class Bulk Freighter is a rare sight in most sectors. However, some larger interstellar governments do have enough trade to justify these large cargo haulers. Usually operated with the minimum crew of 10, the *Elephant* can also carry up to 70 passengers and 3,400 tons of cargo. A common variant of this design installs two Sandthrowers as weapons and reduces the cargo capacity to 2,800 tons, increasing the cost by Cr 100,000.

### Heyerdahl-Class Survey Frigate

|  |  | Power: | 15/1 free |  |  | Mass: | 15/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): | 5,000,000 HP: 40 | Crew: | 10/40 | Speed: | 1 | Armor: | 10 | AC: | 5 |
| Hull Size: | Frigate | Hull Form: | Frigate |  |  | BP Cost: | 26 | BP Annual: | 7 |
| Weaponry | Reaper Battery (3d4, Clumsy) [3 free Hardpoints] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | Augmented Plating (-2 AC, -1 Speed) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings | Atmospheric Configuration, Cargo Holdx3 (60 tons), Drive-3 Upgrade, Extended Stores, Fuel Scoops, Ship's Locker, Survey Sensor Array |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Operating Cost | Cr. 164,350 per Month: Payroll: 120,000, Stores: 24,000, Maint.: 20,850 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

This Survey Frigate is a commonly seen design used by emerging interstellar powers to explore the space around them. The ship normally operates with a full crew of 40, mixing operations, scientists and ground survey teams. The ship is carries a Reaper Battery and Augmented Plating to protect itself in the wild, but is not really designed to fight.

### Pioneer-Class Colony Ship

|  |  |  |  | Power: | 30/9 free |  |  | Mass: | 60/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): | 9,118,000 | HP: | 50 | Crew: | 30/3000 | Speed: | 0 | Armor: | 10 | AC: | 7 |
| Hull Size: | Cruiser BP Annual: |  |  | Hull Form: | Troop Transport |  |  | BP Cost: | 46 |  | 7 |
| Weaponry | Reaper Battery (3d4, Clumsy), Sandthrower (2d4, Flak) [1 free Hardpoint] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | None |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings | Cargo Lighters x4, Cargo Space x33 (6,600 tons), Cold Sleep Pods x5 (15,000), Drive-2 Upgrade, Extended Medlab, Fuel Bunkers, Hydroponic Production, Ship's Locker, Workshops |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Operating Cost | Cr 1,838k per Month: Payroll: 9k, Stores: 1.8m, Maint: 38k |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The Pioneer | is a ship designed with only one purpose, to transport a large number of colonists and their |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

equipment to a new world. Built on a Troop Transport hull, the Pioneer is capable of carrying 18,000 colonists, 15,000 in cold sleep and 3000 awake and 6,600 tons of supplies. Four cargo lighters are available to move supplies and colonists between orbit and the settlement site. The hydroponic gardens provide starter plants and animals for the new colonies. While the ship is armed, it is usually escorted.

### Concierge-Class Private Courier

|  |  |  |  | Power: | 3/0 free |  | Mass: | 5/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): 267,500 | 3 | HP: | 15 | Crew: | 1/10 | Speed: | Armor: | 0 | AC: | 9 |
| Hull Size: Fighter |  |  |  | Hull Form: | Shuttle |  | BP Cost: | 2 | BP Annual: | 1 |
| Weaponry | None [1 free Hardpoint] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | Hardened Polyceramic Overlay |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings | Advanced Nav Computer, Armory, Atmospheric Configuration, Drive-3 Upgrade, Lifeboat, Ship's Locker |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Operating Cost | Cr. 10,115 per Month: Payroll: 3,000, Stores: 6,000, Maint: 1,115 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Designed with the busy interstellar executive in mind, the *Concierge*-Class courier can carry up to nine personnel, in addition to the one crewmember, in crowded conditions. Normally the *Concierge* carries a couple of executives and their staff. The ship's major drawback is its lack of armament. If protection is required, executives will normally use the *Premier*-Class transport.

### Premier-Class Executive Transport

|  |  |  |  | Power: | 10/1 free |  | Mass: | 15/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): | 2,950,000 | HP: | 20 | Crew: | 1/20 | Speed: | 5 | Armor: 5 | AC: | 5 |
| Hull Size: | Frigate |  |  | Hull Form: | Naval Courier |  |  | BP Cost: 15 | BP Annual: | 4 |
| Weaponry | None [0 free Hardpoints] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | Hardened Polyceramic Overlay |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings |  | Fuel Bunkers, Lifeboat, Workshops |  |  |  | Armory, Atmospheric Configuration, Cargo Spacex2 (40 tons), Drive-3 Upgrade, Extended Life Support, Extended Medbay, Extended Stores, |  |  |  |  |
| Operating Cost |  |  | Cr 39,300 per Month: Payroll: 15,000, Stores: 12,000, Maint: 12,300 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | The Premier-Class executive transport is built from a Naval Courier |  |  |  |  | hull. It has significant armor |  | to protect |

the high level corporate and government executives that use it. While the ship can carry up to 20 people, typically the ship's crew is 5, providing extra space for the executives and their assistants.

## NEW STARSHIP FITTINGS

The following new ship fittings, tailored for civilian ships, are for use with *Stars Without Number*. These fittings are completely optional and subject to GM approval.

| Fitting | Cost | Power | Free Mass | Min. Class | TL | Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auxiliary Power Unit | 100k | +5 | 1 | Frigate | 4 | Provides an additional 5 Power Points |
| Booster Pack | 25k* | 1# | 1# | Fighter | 3 | Increases Speed by 1 |
| ECM Suite | 100k* | 2# | 1# | Fighter | 4 | Jams Enemy Sensors and Communications |
| Counter ECM Suite | 50K* | 1# | 1# | Fighter | 4 | Blocks Enemy ECM attacks |
| Laboratory | 10k | 1 | 1 | Fighter | 3 | +2 Modifier to specific science task rolls |
| Mining Equipment | 25k* | 1# | 1# | Fighter | 4 | Mine 2 tons of resources per day |
| Reduced Fuel Bunkers | 2K* | 0 | +1# | Fighter | 3 | Converts Fuel mass to Cargo mass |
|  |  |  |  |  | # Multiply requirements by 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers and 4 for capital ships |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | * Multiply cost by 10 for frigates, 25 for cruisers and 100 for capital ships |  |


*Auxiliary Power Units:* APUs are additional power plants that can be added to a ship to increase the total power output. This fitting may be taken multiple times and each APU adds 5 points to the amount of power available for other ship fittings and weapons. ^new-starship-fitting-auxiliary-power-unit

*Booster Packs:* Boosters are additional engines that increase the speed of the ship by one. This fitting may be taken multiple times, but the maximum speed cannot exceed the limits of the tech level: TL-3: Speed 2, TL-4: Speed 6, TL-5: Speed 10. ^new-starship-fitting-booster-pack

*ECM Suite:* An Electronic Counter Measures suite can be used to scramble an enemy ship's sensors and communicators. Each ECM suite can be used on one target – a ship or station. The Operator makes a Skill Throw and upon success all sensor and communications task rolls on the targeted ship are made at with a -4 Modifier. Multiple ECM suites may be installed and multiple ECM suites may be aimed at a target, the Modifiers stack. ^new-starship-fitting-ecm-suite

*Counter ECM Suite:* Developed to counter the jamming effects of an ECM suite, the Counter ECM suite completely blocks the effects of one ECM suite aimed at the ship. The Operator must make a Skill Throw to block the ECM Suite. ^new-starship-fitting-counter-ecm-suite

*Laboratory:* Laboratories provide space for research and experimentation. Laboratories are common on exploration and survey ships. Each laboratory is dedicated to the study of a particular type of science, providing a +2 Modifier to any skill task rolls made in that field of study. Multiple laboratories, each with their own specialty may be installed. Common types of Laboratories include Biology, Astrophysics, Geology, and Archaeology, but almost any kind of science can be studied in a laboratory. On smaller ships, the Laboratory may take up most of the free space on the ship. ^new-starship-fitting-laboratory

*Mining Equipment:* This fitting allows a spaceship to be used as a portable mining platform. All the required mining equipment, processors and refining equipment is included. Mining equipment can be used to mine resources from asteroids, airless moons or even planets. The resource must be within a few hundred meters of the surface, but almost any kind of resource can be mined with this equipment. While most metals are common, thanks to asteroid mining, that they are not worth the time to mine; rare minerals are still in demand. Mining Equipment allows the crew of the ship to mine 2 tons of refined resources per day of use (20 tons for Frigates, 200 tons for Cruisers and 2,000 tons for Capital ships). The value of the resource is typically 2d10*1000 credits per ton. This fitting may be taken multiple times. Mining equipment is used to verify finds, after which huge mining rigs are brought in to exploit the entire deposit. ^new-starship-fitting-mining-equipment

*Reduced Fuel Bunker:* For ships that operate entirely within a planetary system, this fitting allows the conversion of the large amount of FTL fuel mass back into free mass; increasing the total free mass available. The ship can still use its Spike Drive within a planetary system, but no longer has enough fuel to complete a drill and go faster than light. Refueling costs are 10% of normal costs since most of the fuel used is for FTL travel. ^new-starship-fitting-reduced-fuel-bunker


## STARSHIPS WITH NEW FITTINGS

The following six civilian ship designs incorporate the new ship Fittings detailed above.

### Xunsu-Class Fast Merchant

|  |  |  | Power: | 15/2 free |  |  | Mass: | 15/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): | 1,745,000 HP: | 20 | Crew: | 1/6 | Speed: | 2 | Armor: | 2 | AC: | 4 |
| Hull Size: | Frigate |  | Hull Form: | Free Merchant |  |  | BP Cost: | 9 | BP Annual: | 2 |
| Weaponry | Fractal Impact Charge (2d6, AP 15, Ammo 4) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | Augmented Plating (-2 AC, -1 Speed) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings | (+5 Power) |  |  |  | Advanced Nav. Computer, Atmospheric Configuration, Cargo Spacex2 (40 tons), Drive-3 Upgrade, Fuel Scoops, Lifeboats, Ship's Locker, APU |  |  |  |  |  |

*Operating Cost* Cr. 28,880 per Mo: Payroll: 18,000; Stores: 3,600; Maint: 7,280

Designed to transport extremely important cargoes over long distances, the *Xunsu*-Class merchant is built on a Free Merchant hull and is also equipped with one of the strongest civilian weapon systems allowed, the Fractal Impact Charge. This weapon eats so much power that it has a dedicated APU to handle the demand. *Xunsu* merchants have somewhat of a shady reputation, as many of these ships serve smugglers - and given the powerful weapon system, even pirates. Most Xunsu normally do not carry passengers and operate strictly as cargo haulers; the extra crew serving the weapons systems.

### Blackbeard-Class Commerce Raider

|  |  |  |  | Power: | 15/0 free |  |  | Mass: | 15/0 free |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (Cr): | 6,640,000 HP: 40 |  | Crew: | 10/40 | Speed: | 2 | Armor: | 10 |  | AC: 5 |
| Hull Size: | Frigate Hull Form: |  |  | Frigate |  |  | BP Cost: | 66 | BP Annual: | 8 |
| Weaponry | Reaper Battery (3d4, Clumsy), Fractal Impact Charge (2d6, AP 15, Ammo 4) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Defenses | Augmented Plating (-2 AC, -1 Speed) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fittings | APU (+5 Power), Armory, Boarding Tubes, Booster Pack (+1 speed), Drive-2 Upgrade, ECM Suite, Emissions Damper, Locker |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Fuel Scoops, Ship's |
| Operating Cost |  | Cr. 171,690; Payroll: 120,000; Stores: 24,000; Maint: 27,690 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  | This semi-warship is built to harass enemy shipping and light military craft. The APU serves |  |  |  |  |  | to power the |

Fractal Impact Charge. Booster Packs are installed to keep the speed lost to the installation of the augmented plating. Unfortunately, a large number of *Blackbeards* have found their way into the hands of pirates rather than legitimate privateers.

### Xuanzang-Class Survey Frigate

Still relatively uncommon in the Post-Scream galaxy, the Hawking is built by more established interstellar powers to explore interesting phenomena around them and conduct basic scientific research. The ship Frigate hull and has multiple laboratories that can be customized for a variety of missions. Since many of the areas where this ship goes are dangerous, the ship is equipped with Augmented Plating, although it is not designed to fight.

The terror on many a star system, the *Cnut* or "Black Ship" as it is often referred to, is usually built from a recovered Capital hull and converted into a tribute ship. Tribute ships travel to less developed systems and demand ransom to avoid being devastated from space. Many backward world's only contact with the rest of the galaxy is from these terrible ships. When a *Cnut* enters a system, everyone else flees and the natives huddle in fear wondering how much of their minimal existence will be taken from them this time to appease the warlords from the stars. The ship detailed here uses a Carrier hull – a reclaimed hull reduces the cost by Cr. 60M.
