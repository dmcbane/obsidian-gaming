# Encounter: The Sky Falls Quiet
## Cygnus Arc Slaver Ambush - Pre Departure

#encounter #cygnusarc #pwp 

## Mission Overview

**Mission Type**: Surface Rescue / Atmospheric Combat / Slaver Interception
**Location**: Ankanju Ratri ocean research platform and surrounding atolls
**Timing**: Just as the team finishes the victim drop-off and prepares to depart

## Opening Situation

The team has successfully delivered the rescued slaves to a makeshift refugee camp set up by off-world researchers on one of the larger atoll platforms. The amphibious native Ankanju Ratri people have cautiously emerged from their underwater cave networks to assist with the humanitarian effort, using their dual respiratory systems to ferry supplies between the surface platforms and the air-filled caverns below where the most vulnerable refugees are being sheltered.

A small team of xenobiologists and marine ecologists tend to the refugees while studying the remarkable aquatic adaptations of their hosts. The Ankanju Ratri, with their webbed digits and bioluminescent communication patterns, have been invaluable in establishing secure underwater routes between the surface installations and the deep cave sanctuaries.

As the Aurora Parallax crew prepares to depart, the sky suddenly fills with descending ships. Three vessels drop from high altitude, broadcasting humanitarian credentials from the "Union of Arc Reconstruction Corps" - but the Aurora Parallax crew recognizes the ship configurations. The Ankanju Ratri immediately sense danger, their skin patterns flashing urgent warnings as they begin diving toward the cave entrances.

**Then the jamming begins.**

The researchers' communications equipment cuts out. Their portable sensor array vanishes in a silent explosion. Magnetic tethers drop from the ships, and armed figures begin rappelling toward the research stations and simple dock platforms below.

*"This is Nora Barker of Flee for Freedom emergency response. We're here to evacuate remaining at-risk populations. Please clear the landing zones immediately."*

The voice is familiar - but the weapons being deployed definitely aren't humanitarian. The native Ankanju Ratri are already disappearing beneath the waves, their bioluminescent warnings creating an eerie underwater light show as they flee toward the deeper cave networks.

## The Reveal Moment

If the team challenges the "evacuation" or tries to contact Nora directly:
*"Aurora Parallax crew, this is Captain Vex Korvain. Nora sends her thanks for delivering our inventory to such a convenient collection point. Your humanitarian cover was quite useful."*

The team realizes they've been played - Flee for Freedom was tracking them to harvest the very people they thought they were saving.

## Mission Phases

### Phase 1: Recognition and Response (Rounds 1-3)
- Team realizes the "evacuation" is actually a slaver raid
- Refugees begin fleeing toward underwater cave entrances guided by Ankanju Ratri
- Off-world researchers panic as their equipment is targeted
- Native Ankanju Ratri use bioluminescent patterns to signal safe escape routes
- **PC Goal**: Assess threat and coordinate with native guides

### Phase 2: Platform Defense (Rounds 4-8)
- Veilhands assault from underwater, but Ankanju Ratri know better hiding spots in the cave networks
- Crimson Hooks sweep platforms with fast boats between atolls
- Biogenetics Handler deploys sedation mists targeting research stations
- Native Ankanju Ratri emerge from unexpected locations to assist or evacuate specific refugees using their intimate knowledge of underwater passages
- **PC Goal**: Protect civilians and use native tactical knowledge to disrupt slaver operations

### Phase 3: Counterattack (Rounds 9-12)
- Aurora Parallax engages enemy ships in atmosphere
- Team can board enemy vessels or use Ankanju Ratri cave networks for guerrilla tactics
- Research station's data on native biology becomes key intelligence
- Ankanju Ratri guides provide underwater infiltration routes to enemy positions
- **PC Goal**: Drive off slavers and gather intelligence with native assistance

## Key Objectives
