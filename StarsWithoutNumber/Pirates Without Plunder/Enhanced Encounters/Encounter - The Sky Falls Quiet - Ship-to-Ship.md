# 🚀 Encounter Script: Ambush in the Lower Skies

**Setting:** The PCs’ research frigate _Aurora Parallax_ descends into the upper atmosphere of a contested world, either to deliver supplies, survey terrain, or respond to a distress call. Cygnus Arc Cartel slaver-ships lie in wait.

## 📜 Initiative Order Setup

- Roll **ship initiative** as normal (1d8 + crew skill + ship Speed).
    
- In atmosphere, **Speed differences matter more**:
    
    - Speed 2 ships (all cartel vessels) get **+1 to initiative**.
        
    - If using terrain masking, reroll initiative when a ship changes altitude band (low, mid, high atmosphere).

## 🌪️ Environmental Hazards (Roll 1d6 each round or pick)

1. Sudden crosswinds: -2 to attack rolls this round.
    
2. Storm cloud interference: Beam weapons -4 to hit, missiles unaffected.
    
3. Lightning strike nearby: Random ship must make Power Save (target 8) or lose 1 Power for d4 rounds.
    
4. Downdraft: One ship loses Speed 1 for this round.
    
5. Ground clutter: Ships at low altitude gain +2 AC from sensors.
    
6. Clear skies: No penalty this round.

## 🎭 Round-By-Round Outline

### **Round 1 – Bait**

- **M.V. _Silent Harbor_** broadcasts a **Union humanitarian relief transponder**.
    
    - PCs can attempt a **Notice or Program skill check (difficulty 8)** to detect forged beacon codes.
        
- **M.V. _Lumen’s Grace_** drifts nearby, broadcasting as a “pilgrimage charter.”
    
    - If PCs close within 1 hex (10 km), it powers up its **Grav Spike Suppressor** (forcing Pilot Skill check vs difficulty 10 or lose Speed for 1d4 rounds).
        
- PCs may:
    
    - Investigate, stay clear, or go evasive.

### **Round 2 – Escalation**

- If PCs ignore them, the cartel ships **box them in**.
    
- _Lumen’s Grace_ fires its **suppressor**.
    
- _Silent Harbor_ moves to cut off escape vectors.
    
- PCs can attempt:
    
    - **Survey Sensor Array check (Program, difficulty 8)** to see hidden weapon hardpoints.
        
    - **Evasive maneuvers (Pilot check vs difficulty 10)** to pull free before heavier forces arrive.

### **Round 3 – Predator Arrives**

- **M.V. _Iron Hymn_** enters from high atmosphere, flanked by **two drones**.
    
- It opens with **plasma beam arrays** (suppression fire across hexes) and a **shock torpedo** aimed at the _Aurora Parallax_’s drives.
    
    - If torpedo hits, _Aurora Parallax_ loses Speed until repaired.
        
- _Iron Hymn’s_ **Command & Control Node** grants **+1 attack bonus to allied ships** while active.
    
- PCs must decide:
    
    - Escape attempt (Pilot check vs difficulty 9 + Speed advantage).
        
    - Fire one of their weapons (choose laser for anti-drone, plasma for heavy punch, or Reaper for focused strike).
        
    - Bluff: Broadcast false IFF as civilian research ship (Talk skill vs difficulty 8).
        

---

### **Round 4 – Boarding Pressure**

- If PCs remain entangled, _Iron Hymn_ closes to deploy its **boarding team** (Veilhands or Hellbinders).
    
- _Lumen’s Grace_ attempts to **disable life support** or gas the corridors.
    
- _Silent Harbor_ deploys “aid workers” planetside to snatch colonists while battle distracts locals.
    
- PCs’ options:
    
    - **Target weak ships**: destroying or crippling _Lumen’s Grace_ or _Silent Harbor_ forces _Iron Hymn_ to break off pursuit.
        
    - **Dive into terrain masking**: low-altitude canyon flight (Pilot vs difficulty 10, fail = collision damage 1d6 HP).
        
    - **Bluff cartel** into thinking reinforcements inbound (Talk vs difficulty 10, failure = Iron Hymn enraged, all-out attack).
        

---

### **Round 5+ – Resolution**

- If PCs cripple one cartel ship, the others **retreat to regroup** unless _Iron Hymn_ is still intact and unthreatened.
    
- If _Iron Hymn_ is damaged to **25 HP or less**, it disengages—Cartel doctrine is **profit, not suicide**.
    
- If PCs are boarded, resolve **boarding combat** (Cartel strike teams vs PCs in corridors).

## 🎯 GM Tips

- Keep **action tense and fast**: Atmospheric combat should feel dangerous and chaotic.
    
- The _Aurora Parallax_ cannot win in a straight duel with _Iron Hymn_. The encounter is about **escape, survival, or surgical strikes**.
    
- Use the environment as a balancing lever—storms, terrain, and interference can give the PCs the edge.
    
- If things go too badly, allow **local defense fighters or planetary AA** to intervene just in time.

👉 Would you like me to also build **boarding action stat blocks** (for the Veilhands/Hellbinders strike team and cartel “aid workers”) so the fight can smoothly transition from ship-to-ship combat to on-board corridor combat?
