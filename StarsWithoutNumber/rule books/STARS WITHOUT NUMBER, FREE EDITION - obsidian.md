# Into the Waiting Night

Welcome, reader, to ***Stars Without Number***, a science fiction role-playing game. Within the pages of this book you will find all that you require to forge mighty tales both of victory and bitter defeat amid the silent stars above. You will fashion heroes fit for this new age of exploration and rediscovery, men and women capable of unearthing the lost wonders of humanity's fallen empire. The scattered sectors of the old Terran Mandate have been out of communication for centuries, and no one living can know all the strange wonders that have been born in the Silence. Every fresh world is a new marvel to discover, and the brave souls willing to repair the broken web of contact can expect rich rewards for their efforts.

***Stars Without Number*** is not only a game of discovery, however. There are adventures to be had in more familiar places as well. New polities and young empires have sprung up in the centuries since the collapse of the Terran Mandate, and they struggle with each other as hotly as their technology and resources allow. The right hero at the right time can shift the fate of worlds, and heroes willing to fight for their beliefs can be the greatest resources a struggling star nation possesses. There are adventures to be had in dealing with the powers of a stellar sector, where men and women are needed to foil the sinister plans of enemies and bring victory.

## A Word to Newbies

> If ***Stars Without Number*** is your first tabletop role-playing game, you're a rare soul. Most of the readers of this book will already be familiar with the hobby, but fear not; tabletop RPGs aren't hard to understand.  Just think of them as a pencil-and-paper equivalent of a computer RPG, with a “game master” or “GM” in place of the computer, and 2-5 players playing “player character” avatars.
>
> You'll need paper, pencils, and a set of polyhedral dice or a dice app to play the game. You can get gaming dice online easily. When the book tells you to roll “2d10+1”, for example, it means to roll two ten-sided dice and add them together, then add one to the result. “d100” means to roll two 10-sided dice and read them as ones and tens.

Not every hero has a mind for high goals, however. Many desire nothing more than freedom and the credits to enjoy it. Whether hauling cargo to backwater worlds or selling their lasers to the highest bidder, these mercenary adventurers go where the pay is good and the danger is acceptable. Some have greater ideals than their next patron's pay, while others have no devotion to anything but their own interest. ***Stars Without Number*** has room for both kinds of heroes, and tools to help a game master provide the adventures they require.

***Stars Without Number*** is above all a set of tools for players and game masters bent on sci-fi adventure. While the setting is built to provide a wide scope for daring deeds, the game is fundamentally meant to be reshaped and refocused to suit your particular interests and desires. Whether a gritty game of desperate mercenary gunmen in an interstellar war zone or a dashing campaign of star-faring adventurers in a space-operatic sector, the game is meant to fit the needs and tone of your desired play.

***Stars Without Number*** belongs to the “old-school renaissance” trend in gaming, and draws much of its mechanical inspiration from the classic games of the seventies and the work of such authors as Gary Gygax, Tom Moldvay, Zeb Cook, Marc Miller, and other luminaries of those days. While many people now prefer different mechanical frameworks for their play, these “old-school” rules are understood by a tremendous number of gamers and form a convenient *lingua franca* between many different OSR games. These games are usually broadly compatible with each other, and allow players to loot material from many different authors and time periods with limited effort at conversion.

This game is also designed to be a “sandbox game”, one built to ease the creation of active, living campaign worlds where the PCs aren't the only important figures, and where a hero doesn't necessarily have any narrative armor against failure and death. While it can certainly be played in a more conventional adventure path or story-arc manner, ***Stars Without Number*** is stocked with a wide range of tools, techniques, and guidelines for easing sandbox play. The surprise and freshness inherent in a good sandbox game can be a refreshing change of pace for many groups, and in this book you'll find what you need to play in that style.

The book you hold in hand right now is the revised edition of the original 2010 version of the game. In compiling the revision, I have been careful to keep it compatible with the existing material for the game, so you should be able to use original edition supplements with minimal fuss. Rather than changing the bones of the system, I have instead added additional material to help GMs and entertain players, expanding the scope of the game. If you are reading the free PDF version of this game, you will find everything you need for a full campaign in these pages. If you have the deluxe version in hand, you will find almost a hundred pages of bonus content to supply you with tools for transhuman sci-fi campaigns, space-operatic heroes, stellar wizardry, mechs, artificial intelligences, and tools for building sci-fi societies.

Above all, ***Stars Without Number*** is *your* game now. There is no one “correct” way to play it. There is only your way to play it, and you should feel free to make it the game you want to play.

# Character Creation

Before you can begin playing ***Stars Without Number***, you need to roll up a character. While the game can theoretically work with just a single player and a GM, things work best with 2&ndash;5 friends in addition to the GM. A lone adventurer can get in a lot of trouble out there, and a small group can find it hard to include all the different skills and talents that are often required to survive a sticky situation.

With that in mind, you and the others in your gaming group should give a little thought to making characters that work well together. Grim loners make good book protagonists, but they don't survive well when there's no author around to bail them out.

When making a character, some players like to simply throw the dice and see where they lead. Others prefer to know a little more about the game world and like to have more detail provided beforehand about the worlds and themes of the game. For those who'd prefer a more detailed discussion of the world of ***Stars Without Number***, you can skip ahead to here and read up on it there. For the rest of you&hellip;

## What Players Need To Know

Your character is an adventurer in the year 3200, a dweller among the scattered worlds of a great human diaspora. For whatever reason, he or she has decided to leave their old life behind and take up a starfaring existence, daring perils and seeking new frontiers in search of glory, riches, or their own personal ambitions.

Many worlds have recovered from the desperation of the centuries-long Silence, and can once again manufacture spacecraft and other advanced technology. Other worlds are “lost worlds”, still cut off from interstellar trade and forced to make do with the resources of their own planet. Lostworlders are often considered barbaric by technologically advanced worlds.

Tramp freighters, small merchant ships, and scout craft serve most worlds, even the most backward. If your character comes from a primitive or isolated culture, it's probable that he or she hitched a ride aboard such a ship to travel to a more cosmopolitan life. It may or may not have been a voluntary choice.

In actual play, your character should be motivated to *act*, and to act as part of a group.  The game does not deal well with hostile loners, apathetic brooders, or other characters that have to be coaxed into engaging with the world and cooperating with the rest of the group. The world of ***Stars Without Number*** is dangerous, and characters who cringe from peril or insist on facing it alone will find only boredom or an early grave.

Every character should have a goal from the very start. This might be something as simple as “become wealthy beyond my fondest dreams of avarice” or “be known as the greatest pilot in the sector”. It might be as elaborate as “engineer the downfall of the interstellar empire that conquered my world”. Whatever it is, it should give your character an immediate reason to go out and do something.

This will to act is especially crucial in ***Stars Without Number***, because this game is designed to support a “sandbox” style of gaming. Unlike many other games that encourage the development of a particular story or the playing out of a specific plot line, ***Stars Without Number*** presents an entire interstellar sector to your characters and invites you to choose for yourself how to experience it. Stories will arise based on what your characters do and how they respond to the adventure situations provided by the GM.

As a player, you need to cooperate with your GM. This doesn't necessarily mean following every lead and hook you're given without demurral, but it does mean that you need to respond to the situations and possibilities that are given to you.

You also need to keep in mind that your adventurers exist in a very large world that is not scaled to your characters' abilities. If you insist on throwing your characters into situations or challenges that seem overwhelming, the odds are that they will overwhelm you. Scouting, reconnaissance, and careful intelligence gathering will help you recognize no-win situations before you push ahead into them. By the same token, don't hesitate to flee if your party appears to be facing certain doom. A keen sense of when to decamp the field is often an experienced adventurer's most valuable asset.

## Rolling a Character

> ***Stars Without Number*** belongs to a somewhat older tradition in tabletop RPGs, one where characters aren't so much “built” as they are “rolled”. Players often don't know who exactly they're going to be playing in a campaign, and rely on random rolls to determine a hero's aptitudes and skills. Part of the pleasure of the game is throwing these new-rolled cyphers into play and exploring their personalities and motivations directly through the events of the adventures they undertake.
>
> In most modern games, however, a player expects to be able to create exactly the kind of PC they've envisioned before the campaign begins. They don't want to rely on random rolls to give them the character they're going to be playing.
>
> This is a perfectly valid preference, and players who want to have full control over creating their hero can do so with an attribute array and skills picked from a selected background. Even so, players without strong feelings on the matter might find it refreshing to let their hero's past be discovered by the unpredictable chance of the dice.

## A Summary of Character Creation

For your convenience, here's a quick summary of the character creation process. Experienced players can simply go down the list to generate their next interstellar freebooter, while those new to the game can use it as a guide reference as they go through the steps detailed on the following pages. A blank character sheet can be found at the end of the book.

Note that some steps indicate that you should roll or pick skills, as described here. The first time you roll or pick a skill, it starts at level-0. The second time, it becomes level-1. The third time, you can instead pick any other non-psychic skill of your choice that's less than level-1. No novice hero's skills can exceed level-1 during character creation.

1. Roll your six attributes or assign them from an array, using Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Attributes reflect the basic potential of your hero. Roll 3d6 six times and assign them in order, or use an array of 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 assigned as you wish. If you randomly roll your scores you may then pick one attribute to change to a score of 14.

2. Mark down your ***attribute modifiers*** for each score. When rolling dice that are affected by an attribute, you don't apply the whole score; instead, you apply the attribute modifier. A score of 3 is a -2, 4&mdash;7 is a -1, 8&mdash;13 is no modifier, 14&mdash;17 is +1, and 18 is +2.

3. Pick a background from the list, one that most closely reflects your hero's past experiences. You gain the skill listed under the background name at level-0, which equates to an ordinary working knowledge of it.

4. Decide whether to roll for additional skills or pick them. ***If you pick skills***, you can choose two more skills from the Learning table for your background, with the exception of entries that say “Any Skill”, which you may not pick. You cannot pick entries from the Growth table. If you're not sure what to pick, just take the “Quick Skills” listed for your background at level-0, which include your background's beginning skill.

5. ***If you choose to roll for your skills***, you can roll up to three times, dividing up your rolls between the Growth and Learning tables for your background as you wish. When you roll on the Growth table, some results may say “+2 Physical” or “+2 Mental”. In the former case, you can add two points to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, or one point to two different stats. In the latter case, you can add two points to either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, or divide the bonus between two of them.

6. Choose your class, representing those talents you have that are most relevant to an adventurer's lifestyle. If your hero isn't well-described by Warrior, Expert, or Psychic, you can choose Adventurer and mix your class abilities.

7. Choose your foci, representing the side talents or particular specializations of your hero. You can pick one level of a focus of your choice. Characters with the Expert class or the Partial Expert feature of the Adventurer class get one level of a non-combat, non-psychic focus for free in addition to this. They can spend both levels on the same focus, starting with level 2 in it if they wish. Characters with the Warrior class or Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of a combat focus.

8. Optionally, if your GM is allowing alien PCs or VI or True AI PCs, you can make your character into one such creature by spending your focus level on the appropriate origin focus. Aliens and VIs are described in the Xenobestiary chapter, starting here, while True AIs are part of the deluxe ***Stars Without Number*** core book, starting here.

9. ***Now pick one non-psychic skill*** of your choice to reflect your hero's outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, or other personal focus.

10. ***If you've chosen the Psychic class*** or chosen to be an Adventurer with the Partial Psychic ability, you are a psychic PC, with powers described in the following section, starting here. Psychics can pick two psychic skills from those listed here, while Partial Psychics can pick one. If a Psychic picks the same skill twice, they get it at level-1 expertise, and can pick a free level-1 technique from those listed for that discipline. Both Psychics and Partial Psychics get the level-0 abilities associated with their skills, as described under each discipline they possess. Both also have a maximum ***Effort*** score equal to 1 plus their highest psychic skill plus the better of their Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.

11. Roll your maximum ***hit points*** on 1d6, adding your Constitution modifier. Even a penalty can't reduce your hit points below 1. Warrior PCs and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option add 2 points to this total. Hit points indicate how close your hero is to being defeated. ^character-hit-points

12. Note down any base ***attack bonus*** you may have. The higher the attack bonus, the easier it is for your hero to land a telling blow or shot on a hostile opponent. For most PCs, this bonus is +0. If you are a Warrior or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior class option, it's +1.

13. ***Choose one of the equipment packages*** here or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out how many starting credits you have with which to buy gear.

14. ***Mark down your total hit bonus*** with your weaponry. This is equal to your base attack bonus, plus either your Punch, Stab, or Shoot skill depending on the kind of weapon it is, plus your relevant attribute modifier.  The weapon tables starting here, will tell you what attribute is used for a particular weapon. If two attributes are listed, use the best one for your hero. If you haven't even got level-0 skill, take a -2 penalty.

15. ***Note down the damage done*** by your weapons. This is equal to its base damage dice plus its attribute modifier. If it's a Punch weapon, you can add your Punch skill as well.

16. Record your Armor Class, the measure of how hard it is to hurt your hero in a fight. Different suits of armor grant different Armor Classes; if you aren't wearing any armor at all, your base AC is 10. Add your Dexterity modifier to this. In order to hurt your PC, an enemy has to roll an attack roll on a d20, adding their attack bonus and equaling or exceeding your Armor Class.

17. Note down your beginning saving throw scores for your Physical, Evasion, and Mental saving throws. Physical saves against poison, disease, or exhaustion are 15 minus the best of your Strength or Constitution modifiers.  Evasion saves to dodge sudden perils or dive away from explosives are 15 minus the best of your Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers. Mental saves to resist psychic influence or mind-bending technology are 15 minus the best of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers. To resist these perils, you need to equal or beat the save on a d20.

18. Lastly, wrap up your PC with a ***name and a goal***. Every hero needs to have a goal when they set out adventuring. This goal might change, but your PC should always have *some* reason to go out and interact with the world before them. Stay-at-home PCs and those unwilling to dare greatly for their aims are rarely fun to play.

## Attributes

The first step in creating a character is to determine the character's six attributes.  Attributes describe how strong, quick, clever, perceptive, hardy, or charming your hero might be. Attributes are measured by scores ranging from 3 to 18, with 3 reflecting an attribute so weak that the PC is barely fit for adventuring and an 18 marking the maximum possible aptitude for an ordinary human.

To generate a character's attributes, roll 3d6 six times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You may then change one attribute of your choice to 14 if you wish to ensure that your new adventurer is gifted in at least one way.

If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign the following scores to your attributes in any order you wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores, you cannot replace one of them with a 14.

Once you've assigned your attributes, record the modifier for each of them. This modifier is applied to relevant skill checks or other rolls related to the attribute. If your attribute score changes during play, either from some crippling injury or from improvements granted by your background or experience, you should make sure to update any changed modifier.

## Rolling a PC's Attributes

> Simon's rolling up a character for a new campaign. The first step is to figure out what kind of hero he's going to be playing in the upcoming game, and that means determining attributes.
>
> If Simon had a particular concept he knew he wanted to play, choosing to use the array might be a good idea. It provides a predictable set of numbers he can put in whatever order he wishes, and unless his concept requires that his PC be particularly gifted in more than one attribute, the 14 that's part of the array would ensure that he was capable in whatever natural aptitude was most important to the concept.
>
> On the other hand, even if he rolls the dice, he knows his hero is going to be good at something. He can put that free 14 in any attribute he wishes, so if all he cares about is making sure his PC is quick, he can rest assured that random rolling will still produce a quick PC.
>
> Simon, however, really doesn't have any particular concept he knows he wants to play for this campaign. He decides he's going to let the dice determine what kind of hero he's going to play. Letting the dice make the decision helps him break out of any ruts he might be in when it comes to character concepts, and it can make him consider ideas that might be fresher in play than his usual fare.
>
> Simon takes three six-sided dice in hand and rolls them six times, assigning each number in order to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. His results are 10, 4, 13, 16, 8, and 7.
>
> Since 10 or 11 is an average human score, Simon can see that this PC has a very considerable intellect counterbalanced by pronounced clumsiness and poor social skills. Because he rolled his statistics, he can replace one of the rolls with a score of 14. After some consideration, Simon decides that swapping out his bad Dexterity score makes the most sense.
>
> Now Simon notes down the attribute modifiers for each of his scores: a Strength of 10 is +0, a Dexterity of 14 is +1, a Constitution of 13 is +0, an Intelligence of 16 is +1, a Wisdom of 8 is +0, and a Charisma of 7 is -1.
>
> When rolling skill checks, attack rolls, or other things modified by an attribute, Simon will be using the modifier rather than the full attribute score. The scores themselves might change a little due to his hero's background or future personal training, but mostly they'll serve as cues for playing the PC. With a Wisdom of 8, for example, Simon's hero might not have a penalty to rolls, but he probably makes the occasional decision he lives to regret.

## Skills

Your hero's learned capabilities are ***skills***, and every star-faring adventurer has their share of them. A hero can usually attempt to do anything, whether it's to climb a sun-scorched cliff on an alien world, talk down an enraged lostworlder warlord, or fire a mag rifle at a charging xenomorph, but having the right skill can make a vast difference in results.

Skills are measured in a rating from level-0 for competent practitioners to level-4 for the best in the sector. Novice heroes start with level-0 or level-1 in their skills. You'll choose or roll skills in the next section, when you select a background for your character.

## Skill Checks

Your hero is assumed to be competent at all the ordinary functions of their role and background. If he's a moisture farmer from a back-of-nowhere desert world, he's going to know how to keep a dew still running and how to put on a coolsuit. If she's a corporate magnate's succession-groomed daughter from a megacorp-dominated hiveworld, she's going to know how to read a balance sheet and speak during a meeting with C-level executives. They will never fail at these basic tasks unless some situation makes them much harder than usual.

Sometimes, however, the hero will be faced with a situation outside their usual experience, or will try to accomplish a normal task while under considerable strain or disadvantage. In those cases, you'll need to roll a ***skill check***.

To roll a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most applicable attribute modifier and skill level. If the total is equal or greater than the difficulty of the check, you succeed. If less, something goes wrong, or you fail outright in the attempt, or something unexpected happens.

If you haven't even got level-0 in the relevant skill you take a -1 penalty to the roll. Some particularly technical or difficult feats might not be achievable at all without some grounding in the skill.


### Table - Skill Level Descriptions

| Skill Level | Description                                                                |
|:-----------:| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Level-0   | Basic competence in the skill, such as an ordinary practitioner would have |
|   Level-1   | An experienced professional in the skill, clearly better than most         |
|   Level-2   | Veteran expert, one respected even by those with considerable experience   |
|   Level-3   | Master of the skill, likely one of the best on the planet                  |
|   Level-4   | Superlative expertise, one of the best in the entire stellar sector.       |

## The Skill List

The following skills are standard choices for most campaigns. Games set in unusual reaches of space or unique settings might alter this list.

Skills are general, and some of them may overlap in some situations. A hero trying to clear a jammed disruptor cannon before the aliens break through the door might plausibly check either Fix to repair it or Shoot to represent their familiarity with weapons maintenance. Assuming the GM agrees, you can roll whichever skill is better for you.

- ***Administer:*** Manage an organization, handle paperwork, analyze records, and keep an institution functioning on a daily basis. Roll it for bureaucratic expertise, organizational management, legal knowledge, dealing with government agencies, and understanding how institutions really work. ^skill-administer

- ***Connect:*** Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get them to cooperate with you. Roll it to make useful connections with others, find people you know, know where to get illicit goods and services, and be familiar with foreign cultures and languages. You can use it in place of Talk for persuading people you find via this skill. ^skill-connect

- ***Exert:*** Apply trained speed, strength, or stamina in some feat of physical exertion. Roll it to run, jump, lift, swim, climb, throw, and so forth. You can use it as a combat skill when throwing things, though it doesn't qualify as a combat skill for other ends. ^skill-exert

- ***Fix:*** Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How complex will depend on your character's background; a lostworlder blacksmith is going to need some study time before he's ready to fix that broken fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things, build things, and identify what something is supposed to do. ^skill-fix

- ***Heal:*** Employ medical and psychological treatment for the injured or disturbed. Roll it to cure diseases, stabilize the critically injured, treat psychological disorders, or diagnose illnesses. ^skill-heal

- ***Know:*** Know facts about academic or scientific fields. Roll it to understand planetary ecologies, remember relevant history, solve science mysteries, and know the basic facts about rare or esoteric topics. ^skill-know

- ***Lead:*** Convince others to also do whatever it is you're trying to do. Talk might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make them do it even when they think it's a bad idea. Roll it to lead troops in combat, convince others to follow you, or maintain morale and discipline. ^skill-lead

- ***Notice:*** Spot anomalies or interesting facts about your environment. Roll it for searching places, detecting ambushes, spotting things, and reading the emotional state of other people. ^skill-notice

- ***Perform:*** Exhibit some performative skill. Roll it to dance, sing, orate, act, or otherwise put on a convincing or emotionally moving performance. ^skill-perform

- ***Pilot:*** Use this skill to pilot vehicles or ride beasts. Roll it to fly spaceships, drive vehicles, ride animals, or tend to basic vehicle repair. This skill doesn't help you with things entirely outside the scope of your background or experience, though with some practice a PC can expand their expertise. ^skill-pilot

- ***Program:*** Operating or hacking computing and communications hardware. Roll it to program or hack computers, control computer-operated hardware, operate communications tech, or decrypt things. ^skill-program

- ***Punch:*** Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed. If your PC means to make a habit of this rather than as a recourse of desperation, you should take the *Unarmed Combatant* focus described later. ^skill-punch

- ***Shoot:*** Use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry, whether hurled rocks, bows, laser pistols, combat rifles, or ship's gunnery. ^skill-shoot

- ***Sneak:*** Move without drawing notice. Roll it for stealth, disguise, infiltration, manual legerdemain, pickpocketing, and the defeat of security measures. ^skill-sneak

- ***Stab:*** Use it as a combat skill when wielding melee weapons, whether primitive or complex. ^skill-stab

- ***Survive:*** Obtain the basics of food, water, and shelter in hostile environments, along with avoiding their natural perils. Roll it to handle animals, navigate difficult terrain, scrounge urban resources, make basic tools, and avoid wild beasts or gangs. ^skill-survive

- ***Talk:*** Convince other people of the facts you want them to believe. What they do with that conviction may not be completely predictable. Roll it to persuade, charm, or deceive others in conversation. ^skill-talk

- ***Trade:*** Find what you need on the market and sell what you have. Roll it to sell or buy things, figure out where to purchase hard-to-get or illicit goods, deal with customs agents, or run a business. ^skill-trade

- ***Work:*** This is a catch-all skill for professions not represented by other skills. Roll it to work at a particular profession, art, or trade. ^skill-work

## Psychic Skills

Unlike other skills, psychic skills are restricted to characters with the Psychic class or the Partial Psychic class option for Adventurers. You cannot choose or roll these skills in character creation unless specifically told to pick a psychic skill.

- ***Biopsionics:*** Master powers of physical repair, body augmentation, and shapeshifting. ^psychic-skill-biopsionics

- ***Metapsionics:*** Master powers that nullify, boost, and shape the use of other psychic abilities. ^psychic-skill-metapsionics

- ***Precognition:*** Master the ability to sense future events and control probability. ^psychic-skill-precognition

- ***Telekinesis:*** Master the remote control of kinetic energy to move objects and fabricate force constructs. ^psychic-skill-telekinesis

- ***Telepathy:*** Master the reading and influencing of other sapient minds. ^psychic-skill-telepathy

- ***Teleportation:*** Master the arts of physical translocation of yourself and allies. ^psychic-skill-teleportation

# Choosing a Background

It's unlikely that your character sprang forth fullgrown from the endless depths of space, so it's probable that he or she had some sort of background before adventuring and some kind of training in a field suitable for the life of an interstellar wayfarer. Of course, the call of adventure is somewhat indiscriminate, and some people from very unlikely walks of life might find themselves hurled into the potentially-lethal excitement of deep space. To determine your hero's past training, you need to choose or roll a ***background***.

A background is simply a thumbnail description of the kind of life your hero lived before they took up adventuring. It may not have been the *only* thing they did with their life, but it's the thing that taught them most of their existing skills.

When you've chosen or rolled your background, take a moment to think about your character's past. Decide how your character came to take up that profession, and what made them put it down to follow a more adventurous lifestyle. Did they do it for excitement? Friendship? Money? Or were they just running from a situation they couldn't handle?

You will also want to pick a homeworld for your PC. Your GM can give you some suggestions for worlds in their campaign that would fit your character concept, or you might simply make up your own homeworld or native space habitat with the GM's permission, as you might be from some far-distant sector of space.

Twenty backgrounds are provided on the following pages. You may roll randomly to see where your hero comes from, or pick one that suits you. If none of the backgrounds appeal to you, you can simply describe your hero's prior life to the GM and pick any three skills that fit that past.

## Backgrounds, Skills, and Growth

Once you pick a background, your hero gains several skills associated with their past.

First, you get the free skill associated with the background. Every member of that role or profession needs this skill to function competently, so your hero gets it as well.

Next, you may either pick two other skills from the Learning table for your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables. If you pick skills, you can select exactly the talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of competence and the option of attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you wish, to improve its starting proficiency.

If you're not sure what to pick, just take the three skills listed under “Quick Skills” for your background.

They're the ones most critical to the profession.

## Training Skills and Attributes

When your character is allowed to pick or roll a skill, you learn it at level-0 expertise the first time you receive it. If you receive it a second time, it becomes level-1. If some mechanic or skill choice allows or obliges you to pick it a third time, you can instead choose any non-psychic skill in its place. The only way to raise psychic skills during character creation is via special abilities or foci that specifically boost them. No starting character can begin with a skill level higher than level-1.

Sometimes you're allowed to pick “Any Skill”. This means you can choose any non-psychic skill to improve. Other entries that read “Any Combat” mean that you can pick either Stab, Shoot, or Punch as you choose. You cannot raise psychic skills with “Any Skill” picks.

Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18. A bonus that applies to “Any Stat” can be applied to any attribute. If the roll says to add the bonus to Physical attributes, you can add the bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. If the roll says to add a bonus to your Mental attributes, you can apply the points to either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If the bonus is +2, you may split the points between two different attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

### Barbarian

Standards of barbarism vary when many worlds are capable of interstellar spaceflight, but your hero comes from a savage world of low technology and high violence. Their planet may have survived an all-consuming war, or been deprived of critical materials or energy resources, or simply have been colonized by confirmed Luddites. Other barbarians might be drawn from the impoverished underclass of advanced worlds or the technologically-degenerate inheritors of some high-tech space station or planetary hab.

### Clergy

Faith is nigh-universal among human civilizations, and your hero is dedicated to one such belief. Some clergy are conventional priests or priestesses, while others might be cloistered monastics or nuns, or more martial warrior-monks. Modern-day faiths such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other creeds all exist in various sectors, often in altered form, while some worlds have developed entirely new deities or faiths. If you'd like to create your own religion, you can work with the GM to define its characteristic beliefs.

## Building a Background for a PC

> Simon's got his hero's attributes set, but those are just part of making a character. He also needs to figure out where this hero came from, and what kind of life they've led before they took up the mantle of an adventuring existence.
>
> If he had a particular preference for a background, he could simply pick one of the list here. If none of those fit, he could just write down a few sentences about the background he did want and pick three skills that fit it, assuming the GM agreed it made sense, or rolled on the existing background tables that best fit their custom past. But Simon is still uncertain about the nature of his hero, so he decides to roll randomly for a background.
>
> He gets a 15, so his hero is a scholar. As a scholar, he automatically gets the Know skill at level-0, and needs to decide what kind of scholar he is. Simon considers his options and decides to go with something he knows; his PC is a literature post-doc by the name of Basil Hayes.
>
> Simon decides that Basil should continue with his random rolling rather than just choosing two more skills from the Learning table for a scholar. Because he chooses to randomly roll, he can make three rolls, splitting them as he wishes between the Learning or the Growth table.
>
> His first roll is on the Growth table, and it comes up “+2 Mental”. He immediately puts it into Intelligence, raising the score to 18 and giving it a +2 modifier instead of +1. Basil is a brilliant man.
>
> His second roll he makes on the Learning table, and it comes up “Know”. He already has Know at level-0, so now he gets Know-1. His third roll comes up “Talk”, giving him Talk-0.
>
> A brief view of Basil's history shows him as a brilliant young scholar with a keenly refined mind, an excellent grasp of intellectual topics, and enough glibness to get through a thesis defense. Simon decides that Basil's occasional fits of social ineptitude have torpedoed his career in academia, however, and have forced him out into the world to make a living as an interstellar freebooter.
>
> Simon also needs to pick a homeworld for Basil. While he could ask the GM for a list of likely places, he decides that Basil hails from the cold and inhospitable world of Karelia, a planet that relies mostly on trading the long-duty service contracts of its citizens to other, wealthier worlds in exchange for vital tech. The GM thinks that Karelia sounds like the sort of world that would fit in the campaign, and so allows it. Simon can make up any other details of the world that are needed as the campaign plays out.

### Courtesan

Your hero's career was one of proffered pleasure. Simple prostitution is one form of this background, perhaps as an ordinary streetwalker, a part-time amateur with bills to pay, or an expensive companion to the wealthy, but other forms of satisfaction exist among the many worlds. Refined artists of conversation and grace command high fees in some societies, while others pay well for the simple company of certain men and women with the right bloodlines, special appearance, or auspicious personal qualities esteemed by their culture.

### Criminal

Whether thief, murderer, forger, smuggler, spy, or some other variety of malefactor, your hero was a criminal. Some such rogues are guilty only of crossing some oppressive government or offending a planetary lord, while others have done things that no civilized society could tolerate. Still, their ability to deal with the most desperate and dangerous of contacts and navigate the perils of a less-than-legal adventure can make them attractive associates for a party of freebooters bent on profit and glory more than strict legality.

### Dilettante

Your hero never had a profession, strictly speaking, but spent their formative years in travel, socializing, and a series of engaging hobbies. They might have been the scion of a wealthy industrialist, a planetary noble's younger offspring, or a hanger-on to someone with the money and influence they lacked. By the time your hero's adventures start, they've run through the money that once fueled their lifestyle. Extreme measures may be necessary to acquire further funding.

### Entertainer

Singers, dancers, actors, poets, writers&hellip; the interstellar reaches teem with artists of unnumbered styles and mediums, some of which are only physically possible with advanced technological support. Your hero was a dedicated entertainer, one likely focused in a particular form of art. Patrons and talent scouts can be temperamental, however, and sometimes a budding artist needs to take steps to find their audience. Or at least, to find their audience's money.

### Merchant

Your hero was or is a trader. Some merchants are mere peddlers and shopkeepers on primitive, lowtech worlds, while others are daring far traders who venture to distant worlds to bring home their alien treasures. The nature of trade varies widely among worlds. On some of them, it's a business of soberly-dressed men and women ticking off trades on virtual terminals, while on others it is a more&hellip; *active* pursuit, requiring the judicious application of monoblades and deniable gunfire against competitors. Sometimes a deal goes bad or capital needs to be raised, and a merchant's natural talents are turned toward the perils of adventure.

### Noble

Many planets are ruled by a class of nobles, and your hero was a member of one such exalted group. Such planets are often worlds of exquisite courtesy alloyed with utterly remorseless violence, and a misplaced word at the morning levee can result in an executioner's monoblade at noon. Your hero has done something or been the victim of something to dislodge them from their comfortable place at court. Without their familiar allies, wealth, or influence, they must take a new place in the world, however distasteful that claiming might be.

### Official

Most advanced worlds run on their bureaucracies, the legions of faceless men and women who fill unnumbered roles in keeping the government running as it should. Your hero was one such official. Some were law enforcement officers, others government office clerks or tax officials or trade inspectors. However necessary the work may be, it is often of unendurably tedious nature, and any man or woman with an adventurous spark to their blood will soon find themselves desperate for more exciting use of their talents.

### Peasant

A technologically-advanced world can usually produce all its necessary foodstuffs and basic resources with a handful of workers, the bulk of the labor being performed by agricultural bots. On more primitive worlds, or those with a natural environment that requires close personal attention to crops, a class of peasants will emerge. These men and women often become chattel, part and parcel of the land they occupy and traded among their betters like the farm equipment of richer worlds. Your hero was not satisfied with that life, and has done something to break free from their muddy and toilsome past.

### Physician

Bodies wear and break, even on worlds that possess the full resources of advanced postech medicine. Your hero was a physician, one trained to cure the maladies of the body or the afflictions of the mind. Some physicians are conventional health workers, while others are ship's surgeons, military medics, missionary healers of an expanding faith, or dubious slum doctors who'll graft over laser burns with no awkward questions asked. Wherever men and women go into danger, however, the skills of a physician are eagerly sought.

### Pilot

A pilot's role is a broad one in the far future. The most glamorous and talented navigate starships through the metadimensional storms of interstellar space, while less admired figures fly the innumerable intra-system shuttles and atmosphere craft that serve in most advanced systems. On other worlds, this career might reflect a long-haul trucker, or a horse-riding messenger, or an intrepid sailor on an alien sea. As the Pilot skill covers all these modes of transport, any character whose role revolves around vehicles or riding beasts might justify their selection of this career.

### Politician

The nature of a political career varies from world to world. On some, it's much like one we'd recognize, with glad-handing voters, loud rallies, and quiet back room deals with supposed rivals in government. On others, it might involve a great deal more ceremonial combat, appeals to councils of elders, and success at ritual trials. Whatever the details, your hero was a politician in their home culture. Something went wrong, though, and the only way to fix it is to get clear of your constituents for a while and seek some alternative means of advancement.

### Scholar

Scientists, sages, and professors all qualify under this career. Your hero was one such, a man or woman with a life dedicated to knowledge and understanding. It might have involved the technical expertise of a metadimensional structures engineer or the sacred memorization of the chronicles of some lostworlder sage-order, but your hero's life was in learning. Sometimes that learning cannot be found in familiar surroundings, however, and for one reason or another, willing or not, your hero must venture out into the wider world.

### Soldier

Whatever the technology or structure of their parent world, a soldier's work is universal. Your hero was a professional fighter, whether that took the form of a barbarian noble's thegn, a faceless conscript in a planetary army, or an elite soldier in the service of a megacorp's private military. Whether it was because they were on the losing side, choosing to leave the service, or being forced to flee a cause they couldn't fight for, they now find themselves navigating a world where their most salable skill is one that can cause them a great deal of trouble.

### Spacer

Almost every advanced world is highly dependent upon the resources that space flight brings them. Some of this work can be automated, but every really important task needs a flexible human operator to oversee the work. Your hero is one such spacer, either a worker who toils in the sky or a native void-born man or woman who has spent their entire life outside of natural gravity. It's not uncommon for such workers to find better prospects in places where they can breathe without a vacc suit.

### Technician

Old things break and new things need to be made. Whether a humble lostworlder blacksmith or an erudite astronautic engineer, your hero made a career out of building and mending the fruits of technology. While almost every society has a need for such services, not all of them treat their providers as generously as a technician might wish. Sometimes, these same talents can be turned toward less licit ends, and a skilled technician's expertise is always useful to an adventuring group that plans to rely on anything more sophisticated than a sharpened stick.

### Thug

Your hero was a bruiser. They might have had a notional allegiance to some so-called “army”, or have been part of some crime boss' strongarm crew, or simply been a private contractor of misfortune for those who failed to pay up. They might have even been a fist in a righteous cause, defending their neighborhood from hostile outsiders or serving as informal muscle for a local leader in need of protection. Whatever the details, they've had to move on from their old life, and their new one is likely to involve a similar application of directed force.

### Vagabond

A dilettante has money and friends; your hero simply has the road. Whether they were knocked loose from polite society at a young age or have recently found themselves cast out of a familiar life, they now roam the ways of the world and the spaces between. Some heroes find this life satisfying, with its constant novelty and the regular excitement of bare survival. Others long for a more stable arrangement, and are willing to lend their pragmatic talents to a group that offers some prospect of profit.

### Worker

Countless in number, every industrialized world has swarms of workers to operate the machines and perform the labor that keeps society functioning. Cooks, factory laborers, mine workers, personal servants, lawyers, clerks, and innumerable other roles are covered under this career. If your hero rolls or picks Work as a skill but has a career that would better fit another existing skill, they may substitute it accordingly. Thus, a wage-slave programmer might take Program instead of Work, while a lawyer would use Administer instead as a reflection of their litigious talent.

# Character Classes

In one way or another, your character is cut out for adventure. Your hero might be a veteran combatant, skilled with blade or laser, or they might be a psychic gifted with uncanny abilities. It's just as possible that they could have remarkable talents as a pilot, or be the smoothest grifter in the hiveslum they grew up in. Whatever their particular background, your hero's primary focus is their ***class***.

Your class represents your hero's best set of tools for dealing with their problems. They're the skills and capabilities that they're most likely to turn to to resolve a problem, but not their only tools. A Psychic can still shoot a gun and a Warrior can try to fast-talk a mark.

Choosing a class helps ensure that your hero is good at *something* that might contribute to a bold party of interstellar adventurers. Experts always have a knack at exercising non-combat skills, Warriors are always good in a scrap, and Psychics always have a unique power or two to employ at need. Your hero might have led a quiet life as a starport customs clerk until recently, but their natural talents will ensure that they can do something that the rest of the group will find useful.

In the same vein, you don't have to choose a class that “naturally” fits with your background. That starport customs clerk might have led a peaceful life untroubled by anything worse than portside brawls, but inside her burns a seething, latent fury that is ready to explode at the first opportunity. She's a Warrior, even though she might not realize her talents until the first time she snatches up a dropped laser rifle and unleashes a barrage of death on a pack of alien warbeasts. You should pick whatever class for your hero that matches the kind of play you want to have with them.

There are four possible classes you can choose for your hero: Adventurer, Expert, Psychic, and Warrior. Experts are PCs that rely on non-combat skills such as stealth, persuasion, technical expertise, piloting skills, vast learning, or personal connections. Psychics are those rare men and women affected by Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, ones capable of channeling these metadimensional energies to perform feats of telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and other psionic disciplines. Warriors are hardened combatants, skilled in the arts of war and violent conflict, and Adventurers include those with a mix of talents and abilities, ones who don't fit well into one of the other classes.

Choose a class that best fits your character's concept. If Expert, Psychic, or Warrior don't fit your image of your hero, or if you want to customize their abilities, you can choose the Adventurer class.

## Expert

Your hero is exceptionally good at a useful skill. Doctors, cat burglars, starship pilots, grifters, technicians, or any other concept that focuses on expertise in a non-combat skill should pick the Expert class. Experts are the best at such skills and gain more of them than other classes do.

Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make a shot when the chips are down, an Expert has a knack for succeeding at the moments of greatest importance. Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a failed skill check, taking the new result if it's better. This benefit can be applied to any skill check, even those that the Expert isn't specially focused in. Their natural talent bleeds over into everything they do.

In their chosen field, however, the Expert is exceptionally gifted. Aside from the free focus level that all PCs get at the start of the game, an Expert can choose an additional level in a non-combat focus related to their background. They can spend both of these levels on the same focus if they wish, thus starting the game with level 2 in that particular knack.

### Class Abilities

Every Expert PC has certain special abilities.

- You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background. Most concepts will take *Specialist* in their main skill, though *Diplomat*, *Starfarer*, *Healer*, or some other focus might suit better. You may not take a combat-oriented focus with this perk. In case of uncertainty, the GM decides whether or not a focus is permitted.

- Once per scene, you can reroll a failed skill check, taking the new roll if it's better.

- When you advance an experience level, you gain a bonus skill point that can be spent on any non-combat, non-psychic skill. You can save this point to spend later if you wish.

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), roll 1d6 and add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Your attack bonus is equal to half your character level, rounded down, so it's +0 at first level.

## Psychic

Your hero has received training in controlling their natural Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome (MES), and can wield the psychic powers that come from that strange affliction. Controlling and developing psychic abilities is an extremely demanding process but allows for feats wholly impossible to ordinary men and women. ^definition-mes

Psychics are extremely rare in the general population. Averages vary with worlds, but most range from one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand who have the MES condition that make them amenable to psychic training. Some of these go their entire lives without realizing their capabilities. Others end up exploiting their native abilities without training, almost inevitably ending up seriously brain-damaged or crazed by the effects of unmediated metadimensional energy.

Your hero has been fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or other training institution capable of molding and directing these abilities. They may have come to this later in life, or been recruited young by a society that carefully watches for MES symptoms.

Some societies deal with their psychics more generously than others. On some worlds, psychic powers are accepted and their possessors can look forward to lucrative and respected employment. On others, fear of these uncanny powers and memories of the horrors of the Scream lead to less welcoming treatment.

### Class Abilities

Every Psychic PC has certain special abilities.

- Unlike Warriors or Experts, you are capable of learning psychic disciplines and their associated techniques, as described starting here.

- When you pick this class, choose any two psychic skills as bonus skills. You can pick the same one twice to obtain level-1 proficiency in it and a free level-1 technique from that discipline.

- You have an Effort score, which can be used to fuel psychic abilities. Your maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus your highest psychic skill plus the better of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers. Even with a penalty, your maximum Effort cannot be lower than 1.

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), roll 1d6 and add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Your attack bonus is equal to half your character level, rounded down, so it's +0 at first level.

## Warrior

Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder, gengineered combat hominid, or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk job, your hero has a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** is extremely dangerous, but your hero has the talents to survive situations that would kill a less martial adventurer.

As a gifted purveyor of violence, you get to pick an extra combat-related focus associated with your special brand of havoc. While a character of any class can take these special combat talents, you get this additional pick and a better natural hit bonus than heroes of other classes.

Most importantly, however, Warriors have an uncanny gift for making a shot when a hit is desperately needed, or dodging a bullet when their life is on the line. Once per scene, a Warrior can either automatically negate a successful combat hit they just received, taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one of their own missed attack rolls into an automatic hit. This versatility makes Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and significantly more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general melee.

### Class Abilities

Every Warrior PC has certain special abilities.

- You gain a free level in a combat-related focus associated with your background. The GM decides if a focus qualifies if it's an ambiguous case.

- Warriors are lucky in combat. Once per scene, as an Instant ability, you can either choose to negate a successful attack roll against you or turn a missed attack roll you made into a successful hit. You can use this ability after the dice are rolled, but it cannot be used against environmental damage, effects without an attack roll, or hits on a vehicle you're occupying.

- You gain two extra maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) at each character level.

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), roll 1d6+2 and add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Your attack bonus is equal to your character level so it is +1 at first level.

## Adventurer

The Adventurer class is the catch-all for heroes who don't fit so neatly into the other three categories. Perhaps your mercenary spent her girlhood at a psychic academy, or maybe your combat medic knows more about using a laser rifle than most physicians do. You can use the Adventurer class to customize your hero's abilities, trading focus for wider versatility.

Adventurers split their focus between different spheres, gaining weaker versions of each class' benefits. For example, an Adventurer who is a psionic warrior-adept might have considerable powers of telekinetic force and a brutal expertise at bare-handed combat, but they won't have access to the wider psionic potential of an unrestricted Psychic or the death-defying combat luck of a hardened Warrior.

To define your Adventurer's abilities, pick two of the following three partial classes.

### Partial Expert

You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background. Most concepts will take *Specialist*, though *Diplomat*, *Starfarer*, *Healer*, or some other focus might suit better. Gain an extra skill point every time you gain a character level which can be spent on any non-psychic, non-combat skill.

### Partial Psychic

You are a restricted psychic. Pick one psychic discipline as a bonus skill at level-0. You can improve this skill with foci or skill points gained from advancing a level, but you cannot learn or improve any other psychic skill. Your maximum Effort equals 1 plus this psychic skill's level plus the best of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers, down to a minimum of 1.

### Partial Warrior

You gain a free level in a combat focus related to your background. Gain +1 to your attack bonus at first and fifth levels. Gain 2 extra maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) each level. Thus, at first level, you'd roll 1d6+2 for your maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points). At second, you'd roll 2d6+4, and so forth.

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), roll 1d6 and add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Adventurers who've taken the Partial Warrior option add 2 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) to their maximum.

The base attack bonus for Adventurers is equal to half their character level, rounded down, so +0 at first level. If the PC has taken the Partial Warrior option their class bonus increases this to +1 at first level.

# Choosing a Focus

Every member of a class has certain baseline abilities that let them do well at their role. Warriors are always good combatants, Experts are always gifted with their skills, and Psychics always have a few pertinent psionic abilities. Aside from these baseline abilities, characters also have a ***focus***.

A focus is an additional knack, perk, or aptitude that a hero has, one that grants them certain benefits in play. Each focus has one or more levels of increasingly-strong effect. For example, someone with level 1 in the *Die Hard* focus gains two extra maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) each level and automatically stabilizes after a mortal wound, while someone with level 2 can negate the first injury they suffer each day that would incapacitate or kill them. The benefits of a focus stack, so if you take level 2 in one, you get all the benefits from level 1 as well.

Any character can pick any focus, and it doesn't have to “match” the class you selected. A Psychic can choose the *Unarmed Combatant* focus for fistic prowess, while a Warrior might have enough experience with battlefield trauma to qualify as a *Healer*. The only obligation is that you explain how your hero picked up the training or exhibited their natural aptitude for the focus.

Many foci give a bonus level in a skill as part of their level 1 benefits. These bonus levels work like any other skill pick; they either give you the skill at level-0, raise an existing level-0 skill to level-1, or let you pick any other non-psychic skill if the skill is already at level-1.

Unless indicated otherwise a focus can be taken only once. Once you've taken level 1 of *Die Hard*, you can't pick it again to get an additional two [hit points](#^character-hit-points) per level. Some skill-oriented foci allow you to pick them more than once to apply to different skills.

Beginning PCs can pick one level of focus. PCs with the Expert class or the Partial Expert Adventurer class option can choose an additional level in any non-combat focus related to their background, including level 2 in their initial choice. Most will choose *Specialist*, *Healer*, *Diplomat*, or some other similar focus, but the GM can allow other non-combat foci. PCs with the Warrior class or the Partial Warrior Adventurer class option can do the same in choosing an additional combat-related focus.

As your hero advances in experience, you'll get the opportunity to pick up new foci or improve existing ones as you refine your talents or learn new tricks. In some cases, you might work with the GM to come up with a custom focus reflecting your PC's specific special talent or a perk that makes sense given their recent adventures. Foci are an important part of a hero's character, and they should always reflect something basic about how they tend to interact with the world.

## Origin Foci

If you include aliens or robots in your campaign, you can represent them with *origin foci*. Origin foci are taken the same way as any other foci, and may be purchased with a beginning character's focus level.

If a GM is feeling generous, they can allow a PC to take a level in an origin focus as well as their usual free focus level, in order to allow a hero to start as an alien with some additional knack. A PC who takes this option doesn't get their usual bonus focus at level 2; they've already spent it on being unusual.

Origin foci for robotic VIs are here. Available alien races will vary with the campaign setting, but details on making these race are here.

# Choosing a Class and Focus

> Basil Hayes needs a class. While an obvious pick would be Expert to match his background, Simon decides it would be more amusing to make him a soldier; specifically, the sniper “Basilisk” Hayes, the dire-eyed wraith of the cold Karelian forest. Given the complete lack of a market for his PhD and his own natural poor judgment, Basil signed up with a Karelian mercenary outfit. He's just gotten out of his tour of duty, but at least now his skills are significantly more marketable.
>
> While Simon could go with the Adventurer class for Basil and make him a Partial Warrior/ Partial Expert, he decides to make Basil a fullfledged Warrior. His intellectual talents can be useful, but Basil's main utility to the group is his ability to deal with combat situations.
>
> Every PC gets to pick one focus of any kind, and a Warrior gets to pick one combat-related focus. Basil's first choice is easy, as clearly he's a Sniper, so he writes that down as a level 1 focus. Rather than taking a second level in that with his other pick, Simon decides to have Basil pick up a level of the Gunslinger focus. Basil will get the chance to pick more foci as he gains experience.
>
> Each of these foci grant a bonus level in Shoot, so they stack together to give the young sniper a Shoot-1 skill. Basil's now as deft with a rifle as he is with 19th century Terran Victorian poetry.
>
> Lastly, Basil gets to pick any single non-psychic skill of his choice as a hobby or natural talent. He decides that a sniper isn't much of a sniper without being hard to spot, so picks Sneak-0 as his skill. This free skill pick is often useful for filling in the necessary talents of a concept that aren't supplied by the Learning table or bonus skills granted by a hero's foci.

## The Focus List

### Alert

You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take unaware. You have an instinctive alacrity of response that helps you act before less wary persons can think to move.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be surprised, nor can others use the Execution Attack option on you. When you roll initiative, roll twice and take the best result.

- ***Level 2:*** You always act first in a combat round unless someone else involved is also this *Alert*.

### Armsman

You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This focus' benefits do not apply to unarmed attacks or projectile weapons. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of the *Armsman* focus at the same time as *Gunslinger*.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Stab as a bonus skill. You can draw or sheath a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant action. You may add your Stab skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's damage roll or Shock damage, assuming it has any to begin with.

- ***Level 2:*** Your primitive melee and thrown weapons count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a melee weapon, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage to the target, plus any Shock damage. This bonus damage doesn't apply to thrown weapons or attacks that use the Punch skill.

### Assassin

You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in carrying out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on [Execution Attacks](#Execution%20Attacks).

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no larger than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can draw or produce this object as an On Turn action, and your point-blank ranged attacks made from surprise with it cannot miss the target.

- ***Level 2:*** You can take a Move action on the same round as you make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly with a target before you attack. You may split this Move action when making an Execution Attack, taking part of it before you murder your target and part of it afterwards. This movement happens too quickly to alert a victim or to be hindered by bodyguards, barring an actual physical wall of meat between you and your prey.

### Authority

You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others instinctively follow your instructions and further your causes. At level 1, this is a knack of charm and personal magnetism, while level 2 might suggest latent telepathic influence or transhuman memetic hacking augmentations. Where this focus refers to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be in your service. PCs never count as followers.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you can make a request from an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at a difficulty of the NPC's Morale score. If you succeed, they will comply with the request, provided it is not harmful or extremely uncharacteristic.

- ***Level 2:*** Those who follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC being directly led by you gains a Morale and hit roll bonus equal to your Lead skill and a +1 bonus on all skill checks. Your followers will not act against your interests unless under extreme pressure.

### Close Combatant

You've had all too much practice at close-in fighting and desperate struggles with pistol or blade. You're extremely skilled at avoiding injury in melee combat, and at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without fear of being knifed in passing.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain any combat skill as a bonus skill. You can use pistol-sized ranged weapons in melee without suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're unarmored at the time.

- ***Level 2:*** The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The [*Fighthing Withdrawal*](#Fighting%20Withdrawal%20-%20Main%20Action) combat action is treated as an On Turn action for you and can be performed freely.

### Connected

You're remarkably gifted at making friends and forging ties with the people around you. Wherever you go, you always seem to know somebody useful to your ends.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you've spent at least a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you'll have built a web of contacts willing to do favors for you that are no more than mildly illegal. You can call on one favor per game day and the GM decides how far they'll go for you.

- ***Level 2:*** Once per game session, if it's not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when and where you want to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are and what they can do for you.

### Die Hard

You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.

- ***Level 1:*** You gain an extra 2 maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) per level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take this focus after first level. You automatically stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than a Heavy weapon.

- ***Level 2:*** The first time each day that you are reduced to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) by an injury, you instead survive with one hit point remaining. This ability can't save you from [Heavy weapons](#Heavy%20weapons) or similar trauma.

### Diplomat

You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can manipulate the attitudes of those around you. Even so, while smooth words are versatile, they'll only work if your interlocutor is actually willing to listen to you.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Talk as a bonus skill. You speak all the languages common to the sector and can learn new ones to a workable level in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check dice related to negotiation or diplomacy.

- ***Level 2:*** Once per game session, shift an intelligent NPC's reaction roll one step closer to friendly if you can talk to them for at least thirty seconds.

### Gunslinger

You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to slugthrowers or energy weapons, it is also applicable to thrown weapons, bows, or other [ranged weapons](#ranged%20weapons) that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of the *Armsman* focus at the same time as *Gunslinger*.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can draw or holster a Stowed ranged weapon as an On Turn action. You may add your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.

- ***Level 2:*** Once per round, you can reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action if it takes no more than one round to reload. Even on a miss with a Shoot attack, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage.

### Hacker

You have a considerable fluency with digital security measures and standard encryption methods. You know how to make computerized systems obey you until their automatic failsafes come down on your control.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack a database or computerized system, roll 3d6 on the skill check and drop the lowest die.

- ***Level 2:*** Your hack duration increases to 1d4+Program skill x 10 minutes. You have an instinctive understanding of the tech; you never need to learn the data protocols for a strange system and are always treated as familiar with it.

### Healer

Healing comes naturally to you, and you're particularly gifted at preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When rolling Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.

- ***Level 2:*** Stims or other technological healing devices applied by you heal twice as many [hit points](#^character-hit-points) as normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you can heal 1d6+Heal skill [hit points](#^character-hit-points) of damage to every injured or wounded person in your group with ten minutes of first aid spread among them. Such healing can be applied to a given target only once per day.

### Henchkeeper

You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do your bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement, sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A henchman obtained with this focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important” people in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the desperate, or other persons with few options.

You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings are no more loyal or competent than your pay and treatment can purchase.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within 24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen will not fight except to save their own lives, but will escort you on adventures and risk great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be treated as Peaceful Humans from the Xenobestiary section of the book. You can have one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible time and pick them back up later should you be without a current henchman.

- ***Level 2:*** Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural competence or their devotion to you, they're treated as Martial Humans from the Xenobestiary section. You can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs, but this requires that you actually have done them some favor or help that would reasonably earn such fierce loyalty.

### Ironhide

Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, gengineered skin fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding, you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality combat armor. The benefits of this focus don't stack with armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.

- ***Level 1:*** You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half your character level, rounded up.

- ***Level 2:*** Your abilities are so effective that they render you immune to unarmed attacks or primitive weaponry as if you wore powered armor.

### Psychic Training

You've had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial Psychic class option as an Adventurer to pick this focus. In the latter case, you can only take training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial Psychic. As with most foci, this focus can be taken only once.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain any psychic skill as a bonus. If this improves it to level-1 proficiency, choose a free level-1 technique from that discipline. Your maximum Effort increases by one.

- ***Level 2:*** When you advance a level, the bonus psychic skill you chose for the first level of the focus automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it. You may save these points for later, if more are required to raise the skill or buy a particular technique. These points are awarded retroactively if you take this focus level later in the game.

### Savage Fray

You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can survive being surrounded far better than most combatants.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Stab as a bonus skill. All enemies adjacent to you at the end of your turn whom you have not attacked suffer the Shock damage of your weapon if their Armor Class is not too high to be affected.

- ***Level 2:*** After suffering your first melee hit in a round, any further melee attacks from other assailants automatically miss you. If the attacker who hits you has multiple attacks, they may attempt all of them, but other foes around you simply miss.

### Shocking Assault

You're extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your melee attacks stresses and distracts enemies even when your blows don't draw blood.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10, assuming your weapon is capable of harming the target in the first place.

- ***Level 2:*** In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed attacks. Regular hits never do less damage than this Shock would do on a miss.

### Sniper

You are an expert at placing a bullet or beam on an unsuspecting target. These special benefits only apply when making an Execution Attack with a firearm or bow, as described [Execution Attacks](#Execution%20Attacks).

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a skill check for an Execution Attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.

- ***Level 2:*** A target hit by your Execution Attack takes a -4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal injury. Even if the save is successful, the target takes double the normal damage inflicted by the attack.

### Specialist

You are remarkably talented at a particular skill. Whether a marvelous cat burglar, a world-famous athlete, a brilliant engineer, or some other savant, your expertise is extremely reliable. You may take this focus more than once for different skills.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain a non-combat, non-psychic skill as a bonus. Roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die for all skill checks in this skill.

- ***Level 2:*** Roll 4d6 and drop the two lowest dice for all skill checks in this skill.

### Star Captain

You have a tremendous natural talent for ship combat, and can make any starship you captain a significantly more fearsome opponent. You must take the captain's role during a fight as described in [Captain Actions](#Captain%20Actions) of the Ship Combat rules in order to benefit from this focus.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Your ship gains 2 extra Command Points at the start of each turn.

- ***Level 2:*** A ship you captain gains bonus [hit points](#^starship-hit-points) equal to 20% of its maximum at the start of each combat. Damage is taken from these bonus points first, and they vanish at the end of the fight and do not require repairs to replenish before the next. In addition, once per engagement, you may resolve a Crisis as an Instant action by explaining how your leadership resolves the problem.

### Starfarer

You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike drills. While most experienced pilots can manage conventional drills along well-charted spike routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically succeed at all spike drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.

- ***Level 2:*** Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks. Spike drives of ships you navigate are treated as one level higher; thus, a drive-1 is treated as a drive-2, up to a maximum of drive-7. Spike drills you personally oversee take only half the time they would otherwise require.

### Tinker

You have a natural knack for modifying and improving equipment, as given in the rules in [Modding and Building Equipment](#Modding%20and%20Building%20Equipment).

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many mods. Both ship and gear mods cost only half their usual price in credits, though pretech salvage requirements remain the same.

- ***Level 2:*** Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for purposes of building and maintaining mods and calculating your Maintenance score. Advanced mods require one fewer pretech salvage part to make, down to a minimum of zero.

### Unarmed Combatant

Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives and guns in the grip of the less gifted. Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed attacks become more dangerous as your Punch skill increases. At level-0, they do 1d6 damage. At level-1, they do 1d8 damage. At level-2 they do 1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 1d12+1. At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality equal to your Punch skill against AC 15 or less. While you normally add your Punch skill level to any unarmed damage, don't add it twice to this Shock damage.

- ***Level 2:*** You know locks and twists that use powered servos against their wearer. Your unarmed attacks count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage.

### Unique Gift

Whether due to exotic technological augmentation, a unique transhuman background, or a remarkable human talent, you have the ability to do something that's simply impossible for a normal human.

This is a special focus which serves as a catch-all for some novel power or background perk that doesn't have a convenient fit in the existing rules. A transhuman who can function normally in lethal environments, a nanotech-laden experimental subject with a head full of exotic sensors, or a brilliant gravitic scientist who can fly thanks to their personal tech might all take this focus to cover their special abilities.

It's up to the GM to decide what's reasonable and fair to be covered under this gift. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might require the user to take [System Strain](#System%20Strain) to use it.

As a general rule this ability should be better than a piece of gear the PC could buy for credits. The player is spending a very limited resource when they make this focus pick, so what they get should be good enough that they can't just duplicate it with a fat bank account.

### Wanderer

Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road, they've mastered a number of tricks for ensuring their mobility and surviving the inevitable difficulties of a vagabond existence.

- ***Level 1:*** Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey basic ideas in all the common languages of the sector. You can always find free transport to a desired destination for yourself and a small group of your friends provided any traffic goes to the place. Finding this transport takes no more than an hour, but it may not be a strictly legitimate means of travel and may require working passage.

- ***Level 2:*** You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers and identification for the party with 1d6 hours of work. These papers and permits will stand up to ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/Administer versus Wis/Notice check if examined by an official while the PC is actually wanted by the state for some crime. When finding transport for the party, the transportation always makes the trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter would.

### Wild Psychic Talent

Some men and women are born with a very limited form of MES, the mental condition that allows for the use of psychic powers. While these people are not true psychics, these “wild talents” can create one limited psychic effect. Training is not always required to develop this ability, and their MES is so mild that they don't suffer the risk of madness or brain damage that more developed psychics risk should they use their powers without proper training.

Wild talents are not treated as psychics for general purposes and cannot “torch” their powers. When relevant, they are treated as having one point of Effort. Psychics and Partial Psychics cannot take this focus.

- ***Level 1:*** Pick a psychic discipline. You gain an ability equivalent to the level-0 core power of that discipline. Optionally, you may instead pick a level-1 technique from that discipline, but that technique must stand alone; you can't pick one that augments another technique or core ability. For example, you could pick the [*Telekinetic Armory*](#Telekinetic%20Armory) technique from Telekinesis, because that ability does not require the use of any other Telekinesis power. You could not pick the [*Mastered Succor*](#Mastered%20Succor) ability from [Biopsionics](#Biopsionics), because that technique is meant to augment another power you don't have.

- ***Level 2:*** You now have a maximum Effort of two points. You may pick a second ability according to the guidelines above. This second does not need to be a stand-alone technique if it augments the power you chose for level 1 of this focus. Thus, if your first pick was gaining the level-0 power of [*Psychic Succor*](#Core%20Technique%20-%20Psychic%20Succor), your second could be [*Mastered Succor*](#Mastered%20Succor). You still could not get the level-1 core power of [*Psychic Succor*](#Core%20Technique%20-%20Psychic%20Succor), however, as you're still restricted to level-0.

# Final Touches

You're almost finished. Just a few more things to note down, and you'll have an adventurer ready for play.

First, pick one more non-psychic skill of your choice. This pick represents your hobbies, your side interests, or some well of natural talent. You gain it at level-0 if you don't already have it. Otherwise, it stacks to increase the skill to level-1. You can't pick a skill you already have at level-1.

TODO: replace italics with internal links where appropriate

Next, determine your maximum [***hit points***](#^character-hit-points). Your [hit points](#^character-hit-points) are a measure of how close you are to death or defeat; when you run out of them, your character is dead or unable to continue fighting. You can regain lost [hit points](#^character-hit-points) by rest and biopsionic healing, but they cannot exceed their maximum. Your maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) are equal to 1d6 plus your Constitution modifier, down to a minimum of 1 hit point. Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option can add a +2 bonus to this total.

Now note down your ***base attack bonus***. For most PCs, this is equal to half your character level, rounded down, so it's +0 for most characters. If your hero is a Warrior or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior class option, your beginning base attack bonus is +1.

Record your Physical, Mental, and Evasion [saving throws](#saving%20throws). Your Physical saving throw is 15 minus the better of your Strength or Constitution attribute modifiers. Your Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better of your Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. Your Evasion saving throw is 15 minus the better of your Dexterity or Intelligence attribute modifiers. If you have a penalty in both modifiers, it's possible to have a saving throw of 16 or more.

Lastly, either choose an equipment package from the list starting [here](#here) or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out how many credits you have to buy your beginning gear.

## PCs and Languages

> The standard language of the late Terran Mandate was a highly hybridized version of English. All PCs are assumed to speak “Mandate” unless they've got a very good reason not to, and will rapidly pick up enough to get by otherwise.
>
> PCs also speak all the languages appropriate to their background and history. A native of a French-speaking world will naturally speak French, or whatever French is in 3200 AD.
>
> Linguist PCs with the Know skill know additional languages; one more at level-0, three more at level-1, six more at level-2, ten more at level-3, and all sector-known languages at level-4. PCs who are far-traveled or versed in dealing with other cultures may substitute Connect instead of Know to determine their bonus languages.

# Equipment Packages

Rather than choosing gear from the Equipment chapter, you can just take a premade package from the following pages instead of taking your starting credits.

Once you’ve chosen your equipment, make sure to note down the damage and hit bonus of your weapons, and the Armor Class of any armor you have.

For weapons, your hit bonus is your base attack bonus plus your applicable skill, plus the attribute modifier used by the weapon. For [ranged weapons](#ranged%20weapons), this is usually Dexterity, while most melee weapons are Strength or Dexterity. Ranged energy weapons add +1 to this, as they lack recoil or windage. Damage is equal to the weapon's damage die plus the attribute modifier.

For armor, your total Armor Class is that of your armor plus your Dexterity modifier. Multiple suits of armor do not stack together.

# Quick Character Creation

If you don’t have the time or inclination to do things the leisurely way, you can use the following pages to quickly roll up a hero. You can either pick or roll from any of the tables to get a character that suits.

The first step is to roll on the class table below. This will give you your class, your attributes, the hit point die to roll, and your attack bonus. Each class “style” hints at the kind of PC those attributes might describe.

### Table - Class and Style

| d8  | Class and Style  |   Str   |   Dex   |   Con   |   Int   |   Wis   |   Cha   | HP    | Atk.  Bon. |
|:---:| ---------------- |:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:| ----- |:----------:|
|  1  | Expert (Smart)   | 10 (+0) | 12 (+0) | 11 (+0) | 14 (+1) | 7 (-1)  | 9 (+0)  | 1d6   |     +0     |
|  2  | Expert (Smooth)  | 7 (-1)  | 9 (+0)  | 10 (+0) | 12 (+0) | 11 (+0) | 14 (+1) | 1d6   |     +0     |
|  3  | Expert (Nimble)  | 10 (+0) | 14 (+1) | 12 (+0) | 11 (+0) | 9 (+0)  | 7 (-1)  | 1d6   |     +0     |

|  5  | Warrior (Ranged) | 9 (+0)  | 14 (+1) | 12 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 7 (-1)  | 11 (+0) | 1d6+2 |     +1     |
|  6  | Warrior (Leader) | 7 (-1)  | 10 (+0) | 9 (+0)  | 11 (+0) | 12 (+0) | 14 (+1) | 1d6+2 |     +1     |
|  7  | Psychic (Seer)   | 9 (+0)  | 11 (+0) | 12 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 14 (+1) | 7 (-1)  | 1d6   |     +0     |
|  8  | Psychic (Adept)  | 12 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 14 (+1) | 9 (+0)  | 11 (+0) | 7 (-1)  | 1d6+1 |     +0     |


Next, it's time to pick or roll from the background table to the right. Don't worry if it doesn't seem to fit your class; if your Melee Warrior happens to roll a past as a Scholar, just take a moment to decide why it is that an erudite scientist might also have a savage left hook. You can switch around your attributes if you want to make things fit more closely, such as swapping your Intelligence and Charisma in the case above.

The background options are general concepts as described starting on [here](#here). Your hero might be a model example of their type, or you might shuffle around their details a little, deciding your Ranged Warrior Official is an ex-cop bounced out of the force after investigating an alien smuggling ring a little too closely.

Once you've rolled or chosen your background, note down the three skills listed with it. If one of the skills says “Any Combat”, choose either Punch, Shoot, or Stab depending on what fits best for your hero.

You'll want to decide on your homeworld at this point too. If you're not familiar with the campaign setting, describe your hero's background and ask the GM which planet they're most likely from. The GM can then fill you in on any important cultural or social details that might've influenced your hero's history.

### Table - Backgrounds and Skills

| 20  | Worker      | Connect-0, Exert-0, Work-0        |

If you picked or rolled the Psychic class, roll twice on the table to the left to find out what psychic disciplines you've trained to level-0. If you roll or pick the same one twice, it's level-1, and you should pick a free level-1 technique from the Psionics chapter [here](#here).

Take a minute to decide where you were trained to safely use your innate powers. If you're not sure, ask the GM which psychic academy makes the most sense.

### Table - Psychic Skills

| d6  | Psychic Skill                                           |
|:---:| ------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Biopsionics-0, the art of healing and metamorphosis     |
|  2  | Metapsionics-0, the art of manipulating psychic power   |
|  3  | Precognition-0, the art of sensing the future           |
|  4  | Telekinesis-0, the art of controlling kinetic energy    |
|  5  | Telepathy-0, the art of reading and influencing thought |
|  6  | Teleportation-0, the art of instant translocation       |


Now roll 1d6 or pick from the table below to get appropriate foci for your hero, assuming you'd rather not pick freely. All the foci listed below are gained at level 1 proficiency and are described starting here. Psychics can pick one focus. The other classes get one free pick, plus one more combat focus for Warriors and one more non-combat focus for Experts.

When you choose a focus, you might get a bonus skill from it. If you don't have that skill, you gain it at level-0. If you have it at level-0, it becomes level-1. And if you already have it at level-1, pick any other non-psychic skill instead that isn't already level-1.

The focus you pick or roll tells you a lot about your hero's past. A smooth Expert who's a Connected Diplomat might have been an underworld fixer, while a Healer with Specialization in Talk could have been a psychiatrist or therapist. Take a moment to figure out how your hero's foci reflect their past experience.

## Now It's Time for a Few Final Touches

Pick or roll a bonus skill. You can use the table to the right or just choose any non-psychic skill to add at level-0 to your hero. You can pick a skill you already have at level-0 to make it level-1 instead.

If you're playing a Psychic, note down your beginning maximum Effort, which is equal to 1 plus your highest psychic skill plus the better of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.

Write down your saving throws. Your Physical saving throw is equal to 15 minus your Strength or Constitution modifiers, whichever is better. Your Evasion saving throw is equal to 15 minus the better of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers, and your Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.

Pick your starting equipment, either rolling 2d6 x 100 to find your beginning credit total or picking a package from [here](#here). Note down your beginning hit bonus totals and damage for any weapons you have, and the Armor Class total for any armor you wear.

Finally, put a name on this budding hero and choose their initial goal. What are they trying to accomplish right now? Get rich? Get off their tedious homeworld? Take revenge on a local tyrant? Whatever you pick should be something that motivates your hero from the very start, and it should also be something that complements the interests of the rest of the players. Nobody's going to thank you if you roll up a PC that none of the other party members would want to associate with, or one that can't be expected to play nicely with the rest of the group.

# Psionics

Psionic powers first manifested centuries ago in the wake of the first interstellar flights. Later paraphysicists speculated that something about the exposure to metadimensional energies incurred in spike drive travel changed these spacers, altering genomes or warping their energy shadows in a way that changed their eventual offspring. While this theory was never completely proven, it was demonstrated that psionic powers were far more prevalent on the frontier, in people who were descended of starfaring ancestors, than they were on Old Terra. On most frontier worlds about one in ten thousand children are born with psychic aptitude, while Old Terra displayed only a tenth of that incidence.

Psychic abilities initially seemed to be a congenital curse, one known as “Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome”, or MES. Children manifested MES in puberty or early adulthood, after certain critical stages of brain development opened a channel between their minds and the churning maelstrom of energies that boiled in metadimensional space. By a conscious or unconscious act of will, they could release these energies in various forms. Even so, the passage of unmediated metadimensional force through unprotected neural tissue almost invariably caused brain damage. Repeated use of these abilities caused crippling disability, death, or madness. Most psychics were dead within a few years after manifesting. A few were able to control their powers sufficiently to prevent accidental discharges, but safe, controlled use of these abilities was unknown.

In response, the Terran Mandate initiated the Psionic Authority, basing it on a terraformed Mars. Children from throughout Mandate space were carefully selected by the Authority and brought to the institute in order to study and hopefully cure this tragic condition. Persistent legends speak of horrible experiments and ruthless sacrifices of “test subjects”, but no proof of such evil ever emerged, and after decades of study, the Psionic Authority was actually able to produce protocols that allowed controlled, safe employment of psionic powers.

The bloom of psitech development that followed and the wonders of jump gates and the Second Wave of human expansion are a matter of history. So too is the Scream that erupted six centuries ago and granted every living psychic in human space either violent madness or instant death. The interstellar societal collapse that followed and the centuries-long Silence between the stars has been a matter of living memory for many ill-connected frontier worlds.

With the Scream and the death or madness of every potential psychic tutor, psionics became the horror it once was generations ago. Untrained psychics suffer under the lash of their own abilities, doomed to early death if they aren't fortunate enough to fumble into a means of damping their own powers. Men and women of some worlds now fear psychics, not only for the ancestral memory of the Scream and the chaos that followed, but also because their only experience with these unfortunates has been one of uncontrolled power, madness, and death.

In the past few centuries, however, a few worlds have managed to resuscitate the ancient psychic protocols and develop metapsionic tutors skilled enough to train new psychics. For some, it was the fruit of some discovered pretech wonder that damped psychic energies enough to safely experiment. For others, it was the product of coldly ruthless experimentation on disposable psychic test victims. A few worlds even retained some shreds of psychic mastery from the ancient days, the result of a Scream victim who was lucid enough to teach pupils, though usually for some demented or horrible end. Whatever the source, these institutions provide desperately-desired training for those few afflicted with MES.

These “psychic academies” are scattered widely throughout the sectors of space, usually based out of some amenable planetary polity or defensible deepspace habitat. Some academies are exclusively for the use of a particular nation or planet, while others will accept anyone who can pay the tuition or satisfy the interests of their patrons. Most are powerful players in the local political scene, offering services that mean life and death to MES sufferers and producing graduates who are extremely useful to local rulers. Others need to operate in secret, avoiding the fearful attention of populations that neither accept nor trust their powers.

## Psychic Characters and Training

All Psychic PCs are assumed to have had some sort of training. They may have received their education at a world-famous psychic academy on their homeworld, or been taught in secret by a peripatetic psychic mentor, but only one in a million psychics has the blind luck and natural aptitude to develop an intuitive control of their MES. Of course, it may be that your PC was that one in a million, but you'll want to discuss it with your GM.

Psychic training requires from one to four years to complete, depending on the aptitude of the pupil and the amount of training support they get from other psychics. Most academies have one or more “deans” who actually have the metapsionic abilities to dampen and buffer novice minds. Regular application of their abilities to the pupils allows the students to safely practice and train with their powers until they've mastered the channeling of the energies. Aside from these deans, additional psychic tutors can speed the learning process by demonstrations, technical critique, and “encouragement” of various kinds.

On worlds where psionics are outlawed or feared, most MES sufferers learn to either conceal their powers or accept swift euthanasia or exile from a society that dreads their abilities. Most are unable to do this; their innate abilities boil out at some inopportune time, and their true nature is revealed to their grieving family and neighbors. Those who do learn to contain their abilities can go their whole lives unsuspected. A few receive secret teachings from wandering adepts, ones who can quickly show them how to suppress their powers. The best and most promising might be taken as full students by these adepts, shown how to master their own abilities and eventually teach others as well.

On planets where psionic powers are less terrifying there is always at least one psychic academy in the solar system that invites pupils. Some charge exorbitant tuition, but most are supported by governments, private organizations, or successful graduates. Students are expected to pay for their training one way or another, however; if not in credits, then in service to the patron on completion of the training. Many psychics with decidedly non-academic Backgrounds acquired their experience in the mandatory service period after their graduation. Most psychic PCs will have left such duties behind by the time they start adventuring, though a few of them may have departed considerably in advance of their expected release date.

## Psionic Skills

Psionic powers are divided up into ***disciplines***, each of which has a corresponding skill. Someone with a basic, functioning expertise in the skill has level-0, while a true master of the art would have level-4. Only psychics can learn psionic skills, and they are most often taught at rigidly-disciplined psychic academies. Attempting to develop these skills without such formalized training is almost invariably lethal to the experimenter, though an exceedingly few natural prodigies sometimes intuitively grasp their principles. Even fewer of these gifted naturals are able to express their understanding in a coherent, teachable form.

Some psychics are “unrestricted”. While they usually have a distinct aptitude for one or two disciplines, they can theoretically learn any of them, and may raise any psionic skill they choose. Any character with the Psychic class is an unrestricted psychic. Others demonstrate gifts in only one discipline. While they can eventually master all aspects of that power, they can't raise any other psychic skill. Adventurers with the Partial Psychic class option are such “restricted” psychics.

Attempting to wield a natural psionic aptitude without proper precautions will almost inevitably cause death or madness, as the uncontrolled cascade of MES energies will cause varying forms of permanent brain damage. Untrained psychics can sometimes get away with using their powers very rarely, but these natural prodigies rarely have any ability beyond level-1 in a discipline. Those who use their powers often enough to gain more practical field experience can expect to end up dead, crippled, or insane.

## Psionic Powers and Techniques

Every psychic who obtains level-0 proficiency in a discipline gains access to its core ***technique***. This technique varies depending on the discipline, whether it's physical translocation with Teleportation or tissue repair with Biopsionics. The strength of the ability varies with the practitioner's skill level; the *Psychic Succor* provided by a biopsionicist with level-0 proficiency is much weaker than that provided by someone with level-4 expertise. Core techniques improve naturally as the psychic improves their skill level. They do not need to be purchased with skill points or otherwise specially trained.

As a psychic improves their skill level in a discipline, they may also learn other techniques, special tricks and abilities they've refined through practice. Each time they improve a skill level, they can pick a new technique from that discipline. Most techniques have a minimum skill level associated with them, and the PC can't pick a technique which requires a higher skill level than they've mastered. They also cannot “save” technique picks for later, either. They must be chosen immediately after improving the skill.

The techniques listed under the disciplines here are commonly-known arts that are part of the basic curriculum of most competent psychic academies. No special training is required to choose them when a PC is able to pick a new technique, as the principles were taught as part of their basic education. Other techniques exist that are more esoteric in nature, and may require a trainer to educate the PC in their principles before they can be learned.

Even so, some of the standard techniques might be selectively restricted by an academy, taught only to certain pupils. In some cases, this may be due to a sponsor's restrictions on what kind of abilities they want the local psychics to possess, while other academies might consider them fundamentally immoral abilities. Control over the metapsionic technique of psychic tutoring is particularly strict, as any pupil who has its rudiments included in their curriculum may eventually be able to train other psychics in turn. A PC may have to go to significant lengths in order to patch the holes in a government-controlled psychic curriculum.

PCs who want to learn additional techniques beyond those acquired by improving their skills may buy them separately with skill points, paying one point per level of the technique. PCs who want to retrain techniques may do so at the GM's discretion, usually only when they encounter some new esoteric technique they'd like to learn in place of an existing art. Techniques can only be retrained into others of equal or lower required skill level.

It may be possible for a psychic to create entirely new techniques to reflect their personal aptitudes and special inclinations. Any such novelty is strictly at the GM's discretion, and unlikely to be done more than once or twice over the lifetime of even the most skilled psychic experimenter.

## Effort and Psychic Abilities

Psionic powers are fueled by ***Effort***, a measure of the psychic's mental focus, energy, and neural responsiveness. A psychic's maximum Effort total is equal to one plus the higher of their Wisdom or Constitution attribute modifiers, plus their highest psychic skill score. Thus, a psychic with a Wisdom modifier of -1, a Constitution modifier of +2, and psionic skills of Metapsionics-0 and Biopsionics-0 would have a maximum Effort score of 3. If he were to then improve his Biopsionics skill to level-1, his Effort would become 4.

Effort is “Committed” to fuel a psionic power. Some Commitment is relatively short-term, lasting only as long as the power is in effect. Other powers require that the Effort be Committed for the full scene, while the most powerful might require it be Committed for the rest of the day. Once the Commitment period is over, the Effort returns to the psychic. All Effort is refreshed after a good night's rest.

Whenever a power requires you to Commit Effort, you commit only one point, though additional effects or triggerings may require separate Commitments.

## Torching

Psychics can push past their limits by “torching”, intentionally ignoring safety protocols and neural refractory periods to channel MES energy beyond their normal capacity. For untrained MES subjects, *all* their power use qualifies as torching, as they lack the training necessary to develop safe reserves of Effort.

Torching is an Instant action that can be performed once per round. It provides a free point of Effort that lasts for the rest of the scene, even if this point puts a psychic over the maximum allowed. Every time the psychic torches, however, they have to roll on the torching result table below.

### Table - Torching Results

| d6  | Torching Result                           |
|:---:| ----------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Lose 1 point from your Wisdom score       |
| 3-4 | Lose 1 point from your Constitution score |
|  5  | Lose 1 point from an attribute you choose |
|  6  | No harm is done by the torching           |


Psychics reduced below a Wisdom score of 3 go violently insane and become “feral psychics”; those reduced below scores of 3 in other attributes likewise become dead or nonviable as player characters.

There is no available cure for brain damage caused by torching, and even advanced pretech technology has no generally-known remedy.

Feral psychics are exceptionally dangerous, as their form of brain damage invariably results in violent, psychotic behavior and terrifying hallucinations. Worse still, they can torch with impunity thereafter, as the MES energies have already burnt a clear path through what remains of their sanity. Feral psychics have effectively unlimited Effort with what powers they have obtained. There is no known cure for a feral psychic.

## Attitudes Toward Psychics

Most worlds have a warily accepting attitude toward psionic abilities. Provided they've received appropriate training, a psychic can live and work in relative peace. They are not normally required to wear any sort of external badge or marking, and they are entitled to keep their own abilities private from anyone but the government if they so wish. They may be subject to mandatory “national service”, depending on the polity, and their special abilities might be impressed by the government in cases of extreme need, but they are able to live a relatively normal, if very well-remunerated life. Ordinary men and women have only a vague understanding of psychic powers, but they understand enough to know the basic types of disciplines and the sort of effects each can produce.

Other worlds have a warmer attitude towards psychics. Those gifted with MES are elevated above the ordinary rabble, their abilities celebrated and directed toward the advantage of their communities. Such societies often have psychic ability as a prerequisite for substantial authority, and have worked precognitive visions or telepathic scans into the ordinary fabric of life. Offworld psychics tend to be treated with considerable respect on these worlds, though sometimes they're also expected to provide services or guidance they may not be equipped to give. Citizens of these worlds usually have an excellent understanding of how psychic disciplines work, in addition to understanding ways to counter them.

A few worlds have outright hostility towards psychics and their abilities. MES sufferers might be viewed as pitiable victims of a lethal affliction they can't control, but trained and capable psychics are threats to be wiped out. Their telepathic probings, cheating foresight, and impossibly elusive teleportation makes them a menace to normal human beings, and society cannot tolerate their existence. Some worlds forbid psionics out of fear of another Scream, while others do so out of misunderstandings, a desire for social stability, or local conditions that make psionic powers exceptionally dangerous. A few of these worlds have private psychic academies to train psionic myrmidons for the ruling class or deniable agents of private intrigue.

On almost all worlds, however, psychics can expect to suffer considerably harsher legal penalties than conventional criminals. Some worlds simply have no resources to jail an unwilling teleporter or mind-reading telepath, while others expect those of great gifts to have correspondingly great virtue. It's not unknown for psychics to face summary execution for crimes that would earn other malefactors a simple jail sentence.

A few worlds have ancient pretech artifacts or technologies that are capable of defeating or suppressing psychic powers. Such resources are always extremely rare, and normally only deployed to protect heads of state and similar top-level figures, along with government sites of planetary importance.

# Biopsionics

Biopsionic powers repair, augment, debilitate, or damage living creatures. Unless otherwise specified the biopsionicist must be able to touch a target, though clothing and armor do not interfere with the use of these abilities. Touching a willing or unsuspecting target is automatic, whereas touching a resisting target requires a normal Punch hit roll with a bonus equal to the practitioner's Biopsionics skill. Such touch effects do not inflict the normal damage of a Punch attack.

Unsurprisingly, biopsionic powers are among the most accepted psychic abilities. Even a modestly-experienced biopsion can perform miracles of healing for a community lucky enough to have their services.

## System Strain

Many curative biopsionic powers add to the target's ***System Strain***. System Strain is a measure of the amount of system stress, intrusive modification, and general biological distress an organism might be suffering. Psionic healing, cybernetic implants, and powerful drugs all add to a target's System Strain.

If using a power or drug on a target would make their System Strain exceed their Constitution score, the effect fails to function; their body simply cannot adapt to the changes and cannot benefit from them.

System Strain decreases automatically by one point after each night of rest, provided the organism is well-fed and not compromised by sickness or privation.

### Core Technique - Psychic Succor

The adept's touch stabilizes critically-wounded organisms. More sophisticated practitioners can heal tissue injuries, though curing diseases, detoxifying poisons, and fixing congenital deformities require additional techniques. Each use of *Psychic Succor* adds one point of System Strain to the target, or two points if they were mortally wounded at the time.

Activating *Psychic Succor* requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the rest of that scene without Committing Effort again.

- ***Level-0:*** The psychic's touch can automatically stabilize a mortally-wounded target as a Main Action. This power must be used on a target within six rounds of their collapse, and does not function on targets that have been decapitated or killed by Heavy weapons. It's the GM's decision as to whether a target is intact enough for this power to work.

- ***Level-1:*** As level-0, and heal 1d6+1 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) of damage. If used on a mortally-wounded target, they revive with the rolled [hit points](#^character-hit-points) and can act normally on the next round.

- ***Level-2:*** As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) instead.

- ***Level-3:*** As level-2, but healing 2d6+6 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) instead.

- ***Level-4:*** As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) instead.

### Mastered Succor

#### level_1

The biopsion has developed a sophisticated mastery of their core ability, and they no longer need to Commit Effort to activate it, and may use it whenever they wish. The use of additional techniques that augment *Psychic Succor* might still require Effort to be Committed.

### Organic Purification Protocols
#### level_1

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* now cures any poisons or diseases the subject may be suffering, albeit it requires Committing Effort for the day as an additional surcharge. Biowarfare organisms, exceptionally virulent diseases, or TL5 toxins may resist this curing, requiring a Wis/Biopsionics skill check at a difficulty of at least 10. Failure means that the adept cannot cure the target's disease. This technique cannot cure congenital illnesses.

### Remote Repair
#### level_1

*Psychic Succor* and other biopsionic techniques that normally require touch contact can now be applied at a distance up to 100 meters, provided the biopsion can see the target with their unaided vision. Hostile powers that normally require a hit roll will hit automatically. Each time this technique is used, Effort must be Committed for the scene.

### Invincible Stand
#### level_2

The biopsion has mastered techniques of emergency tissue reinforcement and system stabilization. As an Instant action, they can Commit Effort for the scene to keep themself or a target they can touch active even at zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points). This technique must be used once every round on the target or they collapse at the end of the round. If the target suffers hit point damage, the biopsion must Instantly Commit Effort for the scene or the target goes down immediately with a mortal wound. A Heavy weapon hit on a subject of this power or similar physical dismemberment will always kill a target, regardless of this technique.

### Major Organ Restoration
#### level_2

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* can now cure congenital birth defects and regrow missing limbs and organs. It can even be used to stabilize targets that have been dropped by Heavy weapons, decapitated, or otherwise dramatically dismembered, provided it's used within one round per level of Biopsionic skill. The best that can be done for such badly-mangled targets is stabilization, after which they must rest for 24 hours before any further [hit points](#^character-hit-points) can be healed by Biopsionics, stims, or natural rest.

### Tissue Integrity Field
#### level_2

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* may now also affect all allies within ten meters of the target. Allies can decline the healing if they don't require it or don't want to take the additional System Strain. Each use of this technique requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for the day in addition to the cost of the *Psychic Succor*.

### Accelerated Succor
#### level_3

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* now can be used as an On Turn power, albeit only once per round. By Committing an additional Effort for the day with each use, it can even be used as an Instant power, though it still can only be used once per round. Any surcharges for augmenting the succor apply normally, such as with *Tissue Integrity Field*.

### Metamorph
#### level_3

The biopsion can now shape their own or another willing target's physical form as a Main Action, transforming a touched target into any humanoid form within 50% of their own mass. Claws and other body armaments can be fashioned equivalent to Light or Medium melee weapons and innate armor equivalent to AC 13. Gills and other environmental-survival alterations are also viable at the GM's discretion, but flight is a bridge too far for this power.

A person can be impersonated down to the DNA level, provided a blood or hair sample is available. The use of this adds one System Strain point to the target that does not recover so long as the change is in effect. Applying *Metamorph* requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for as long as the change is to be maintained. If applied to a target other than the psychic, the power automatically ends if the psychic gets more than one hundred kilometers away.

### Teratic Overload
#### level_3

This use of biopsionics inflicts potentially-lethal damage on a touched target as a Main Action, and requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for the scene. The target suffers 1d6 damage per level of the psychic's Biopsionics skill and must make a Physical saving throw. On a failure, the damage is tripled and the target is now affected by an obvious, lethal cancer that will kill them in 1d6 months. The cancer can be treated by a TL4 hospital or ship's sick bay if managed within a month's time. If the biopsion Commits Effort for the day instead of the scene, they can control the power sufficiently to do no hit point damage and create very subtle tumors, leaving the cancer undetectable without a TL4 medical examination. Such victims probably won't even know they've been attacked by this power. Whether a success or failure, this power cannot be used on the same target more than once per scene.

### Holistic Optimization Patterning
#### level_4

The biopsion gains the ability to drastically augment their own or a touched ally's physical abilities as an On Turn action. This boost lasts for the rest of the scene, adds two points of System Strain to the target and gives them a +2 bonus to all Strength or Dexterity skill checks, hit rolls, and damage rolls along with 20 extra [hit points](#^character-hit-points). Any damage is taken off these temporary [hit points](#^character-hit-points) first, and both the bonuses and any [hit points](#^character-hit-points) in excess of the target's maximum are lost at the end of the scene. Each invocation of this technique requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day, and this power cannot be used on a given target more than once per scene.

### Quintessential Reconstruction
#### level_4

The biopsion becomes extremely difficult to kill, encoding their mind in a coherent pattern of MES energy coterminous with their realspace coordinates. If killed, the psychic will regenerate from the largest remaining fragment of their body over 24 hours. This process maximizes their System Strain for one week. If brought to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) during this week, they die instantly and permanently. The psychic retains a vague awareness of their surroundings while “dead” and can postpone their regeneration for up to a week in order to avoid notice, but burial or entombment may result in a very short second life. Each use of this power inflicts one point of permanent attribute loss in an attribute of the biopsion's choice.

# Biopsionics and Hospitals

> Biopsionics is a spectacularly effective discipline for curing physical injuries and sicknesses, but its use for the latter is capped by the biopsion's available Effort. Hospitals on worlds with access to psychic academies often have several biopsions on staff, proficient with the requisite techniques and capable of quickly healing tremendous amounts of trauma injuries on short notice.
>
> Assuming one proficient and available biopsion for every 100,000 citizens, however, the total amount of sickness-curing ability is going to be very limited, and likely reserved for the powerful and wealthy. The vanishingly few psychics who are master metapsions capable of the *Flawless Mastery* of *Organic Purification Protocols* can easily command as much as two thousand credits a day just for temporary work at a grateful hospital.
>
> Ordinary PC biopsions who want to pick up some extra work curing sicknesses can usually find temp employment with a local medical facility for 50 credits per day per Effort point they have. Note that some patients may be *very upset* if the hospital fails to assign them the PC's limited Effort.

# Metapsionics

Metapsionics is the rarest and most esoteric of the psychic disciplines, with few psychics having the necessary temperament or interest in developing these complex abilities. A metapsion controls psychic energy itself, molding and shaping the flows of energy that spill through the brains of those marked by MES.

Taken in isolation, metapsionics allows a psychic to increase the raw Effort available to them and become more flexible in how this Effort is used. Expert metapsions can even teach other potential psychics how to control and channel their new abilities, and the services of a trained psychic mentor command considerable sums in most systems.

Beyond this, in most stellar sectors a competent metapsion is the only practical way to protect a target from undetectable psychic assault. Without a vigilant brainguard, a head of state, interstellar celebrity, or planetary oligarch might find their minds rifled effortlessly by some undetected psychic intruder.

As a consequence, many metapsions become much more physically competent and better-trained in combat than the average psychic. The high prices they can command as brainguards attract some, though others find their clients too aggravating to endure for long.

## Core Technique - Psychic Refinement

The metapsion gains improved mastery over their own powers and an innate sensitivity to the use of psionic abilities in their presence.

- ***Level-0:*** The adept can visually and audibly detect the use of psychic powers. If both the source and target are visible to the metapsion, they can tell who's using the power, even if it's normally imperceptible. They gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw versus a psionic power.

- ***Level-1:*** The metapsion's maximum Effort increases by an additional point.

- ***Level-2:*** The adept can determine whether or not a person is a psychic or has latent psionic abilities through one round of visual inspection. Their saving throw bonus against psionic powers increases to +3.

- ***Level-3:*** The metapsion's maximum Effort increases by an additional point.

- ***Level-4:*** The metapsion can perform a slightly safer version of torching. Instead of rolling the torching damage die, they simply suffer 10 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) of damage after torching is used. The damage occurs after the fueled power activates, allowing a psychic at low [hit points](#^character-hit-points) to trigger a power before falling unconscious. This damage cannot be healed by anything but natural bed rest, though a psychic can be stabilized if this technique drops her to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points).

### Cloak Powers
#### level_1

The metapsion can conceal their own psychic abilities from metapsionic senses. They must Commit Effort for as long as they wish to cloak their powers. While hidden, only a metapsion with equal or higher skill in Metapsionics can detect their abilities with their level-0 or level-2 *Psychic Refinement* abilities. In such cases, an opposed Wis/Metapsionics roll is made between the metapsion and the investigator. If the investigator wins, the cloak is pierced, while if the metapsion wins, the investigator's *Psychic Refinement* remains oblivious.

### Mindtracing
#### level_1

The metapsion can trace back the use of psionic powers they've noticed in their presence. By Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant action, they can see and hear through the senses of a user of a psychic power, gaining an intuitive awareness of their location and treating them as a visible target for purposes of their own abilities. Thus, if they see someone being affected by a telepathy power with no visible source, they can use this ability to briefly share the hidden telepath's senses. If used on a target that is teleporting, they can perceive the teleporter's view of their destination. Use on a metamorphically-shaped impostor would reveal the biopsion responsible for the change, and so forth. These shared senses last for only one round and do not interfere with the adept's other actions.

### Synthetic Adaptation
#### level_1

This is a particularly esoteric technique, one that requires the adept to have at least Program-0 or Fix-0 skill in order to master. With it, however, the metapsion has learned how to synergize with the quantum intelligence of a VI or True AI in order to apply Telepathy or Biopsion powers to their inanimate corpus. Only intelligent machines can be affected, as the technique requires a sentient mind to catalyze the effect.

This synergy takes much of its force from the adept. Any System Strain the powers might inflict must be paid by the adept rather than the target.

### Neural Trap
#### level_2

The metapsion allows a hostile psychic into their mental sanctum in order to gain a later advantage. When targeted by a hostile psionic power that allows a save, the metapsion may Commit Effort as an Instant action and voluntarily fail the saving throw, accepting the effect. The next psychic power the user targets at that assailant then allows the victim no saving throw. This technique lasts until the metapsion makes their psychic attack or reclaims their Committed Effort. A hostile psychic may be affected by only one *Neural Trap* from a given psychic at a time.

### Psychic Static
#### level_2

As an Instant action, the metapsion may Commit Effort for the day to negate a perceived psychic power. The psychic responsible for the effect must Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to resist this negation, otherwise the power ends and any action used to trigger it is wasted. The PC may then Commit Effort for the day again, with each spending and counter-spending until one runs out of Effort or chooses to stop. *Psychic Static* can be applied only once per round to any particular power. The target of the *Psychic Static* automatically knows the position of the interfering metapsion, though other onlookers do not have any obvious way of identifying the metapsion.

### Suspended Manifestation
#### level_2

The metapsion is capable of “hanging” a psychic power in their brain, forming the energy patterns and then suspending them in a self-sustaining loop until it's time to trigger their release. The psychic must Commit Effort for the day to hang a power, along with the Effort normally necessary to trigger it. None of this Effort can be recovered until the power is expended, after which it recovers at its usual speed. Activating the power is an Instant action, or an On Turn action if it allows the target a saving throw of some kind. Only one ability can be held suspended at any one time.

### Concert of Minds
#### level_3

As an On Turn action, the metapsion may Commit Effort and form a psychic gestalt with one or more willing psychics within three meters, including up to one other psychic per Metapsion skill level. This gestalt persists as long as the Effort remains committed, regardless of the subsequent distance between psychics. On their own turn, any member of the gestalt may use any power or technique known by any other member, using the other member's skill levels as necessary and paying any Effort cost from their own pool. This gestalt shares only psychic power, not thoughts or senses. At the end of each round in which one or more members have used some other member's powers or abilities on their turn of action, the metapsion must Commit Effort for the scene or the gestalt drops and cannot be re-established for the rest of the scene.

### Metadimensional Friction
#### level_3

As a Main Action, the metapsion Commits Effort for the scene to create localized MES turbulence around a visible target psychic within 200 meters. Each time the target Commits Effort or an NPC initiates a psychic power, they suffer 1d8 damage per Metapsionics skill level of the adept. Each time the target suffers the damage they can attempt a Mental saving throw to throw off the effect. It lasts no longer than the rest of the scene at most. Only one application of this friction can affect a target at once.

### Psychic Tutelage
#### level_3

An expert metapsion can modulate and temper the metadimensional energy that surges through an untrained psychic's mind. This “safety buffer” allows the novice to experiment with their abilities and gradually develop the control they need to channel their powers without causing permanent brain damage. Without this technique, it is virtually impossible to turn a normal with untapped potential into a trained psychic.

An adept with Metapsionics-3 skill can train up to ten pupils at once. One with Metapsionics-4 can train up to one hundred. It requires only a week to train a potential in ways to avoid accidentally triggering their powers and suffering the damage that follows, but actually teaching them to use their powers effectively takes anywhere from one to four years depending on their natural aptitude and the availability of other psychics willing to assist the metapsion in the training process.

### Surge Momentum
#### level_3

The metapsion's abilities can be reinforced with a degree of metadimensional energy that would cause substantial damage to a less adept mind. Particularly weak or unprepared minds might be completely crushed by the force of the adept's augmented will.

The adept must Commit Effort for the day when using a power that normally grants its target a saving throw. The target then suffers a penalty equal to the adept's Metapsionics skill on any saving throw normally granted by the power. If the target's hit die total or character level is less than half the adept's level, rounded up, they automatically fail their saving throw.

### Flawless Mastery
#### level_4

When this technique is learned, the adept may choose one technique from any discipline they know. That technique no longer requires Effort to be Committed in any way, though other techniques that augment it may still exact a cost. Mastered *Psychic Static*, for example, can expend an effectively unlimited amount of effort. If the technique has a duration based on Committed Effort then it lasts until the metapsion chooses to end it or is killed. This technique may only be mastered once, though the perfected technique may be changed with a month of meditation and practice.

### Impervious Pavis of Will
#### level_4

When this technique is learned, the metapsion must choose a discipline. They then become entirely immune to unwanted powers from that discipline; they and their abilities are simply not valid targets for purposes of that discipline's powers unless the adept chooses to be affected. By Committing Effort for the day as an Instant action, they can extend this immunity for a scene to all allies within 50 meters. This technique may be learned more than once, and any shared protection applies to all disciplines negated by the adept.

# Precognition

The discipline of Precognition relates to sensing the cascade of future events and reading the achronal chaos of the metadimensional energy that ripples in the psychic's brain. Readings provided by Precognition tend to be focused on the psychic and what they find interesting or important. Matters irrelevant to the seer are unlikely to be noticed, even if they are of critical importance to those involved. More advanced techniques of Precognition can even influence the future, adjusting probabilities by changing or pruning certain metadimensional currents.

The future is not carved in stone. Oracles can be falsified by present action or sheer random chance. When a reading is ambiguous or the future seems uncertain, the GM should simply give the most probable reading for the power as their own judgment recommends.

Precognition is strictly future-oriented. For assorted complex reasons, the past is vastly more difficult to observe with psionic powers, and postcognition is generally considered impossible.

Precogs are generally viewed with considerable unease by the general population. They're not as widely feared as telepaths, but the uncanny powers of foresight they possess can make them difficult company. They can earn very substantial sums of money from those desperate to learn of some future outcome, but the specificity of their visions makes it difficult for them to perceive large-scale future events.

A precog can see a city in flames or a stock market board showing a crash, but even the most powerful can't tell if the conflagration is just a limited local disaster or a planet-consuming catastrophe, nor can they tell if the crash is a temporary pullback in the market or a harbinger of global depression. Many precogs have difficulty dealing with this ambiguity, and some become fixed on personal interpretations of their visions that may or may not play out as they have seen.

## Bending the Future

Everything a precog sees is provisional. Some outcomes may be so likely as to be nigh-certain, but nothing is truly, absolutely destined. Vigorous activity or simple unexpected chance can skew future outcomes.

This effect is one reason why choirs of precogs have not been more widely exploited by planetary governments. The clearer and more detailed a future outcome becomes, the simpler it is to find the crucial events that can be changed to derail it. The more intense the precognitive focus toward a future event, the more fluid it becomes as fresh readings take into account the countermoves that others have made. Rumors persist of ancient pretech augmentation hardware that can “fix” future outcomes, but most governments lack the resources to even consider such extravagance.

## Core Technique - Oracle

The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of their own future. Each invocation of the *Oracle* technique requires a Main Action and that the user Commit Effort for the day. Once triggered, the adept gets a single brief vision related to the question about the future that they're asking. This vision is always from their own personal vantage point and never reveals more than a minute of insight, though the psychic processes it almost instantly as part of the power's use.

The GM should answer the question as if the PC were about to perform the act or engage in the investigation pertinent to the question. Thus, if the adept wanted to know what pressing a button would do and the GM knows that it's connected to a bomb, the psychic might get a vision of sudden death. If the bomb were on a time delay that extended past the time horizon of the oracle, however, the psychic might just see a vision of herself waiting patiently, with nothing happening.

Visions should relate to actions and events, not abstract facts. *Oracle* couldn't tell a psychic who the crime boss of a slum neighborhood is, for example, but it could give a vision of the psychic caught in the next bloody riot and the gang boss who's directing the myriad thugs. It couldn't reveal the name of a security guard, but it could show the seer the impending moment that the next guard patrol will enter the area the psychic plans to infiltrate. Only the most important or significant information is conveyed by the technique, even if multiple events of interest might transpire during the time horizon.

*Oracle* can only be used on a given question or topic once until the situation changes substantially or a week goes by. The maximum time horizon of the *Oracle* increases as the adept's Precognition skill improves.

- ***Level-0:*** One minute into the future.

- ***Level-1:*** One day into the future.

- ***Level-2:*** One week into the future.

- ***Level-3:*** Three months into the future.

- ***Level-4:*** One year into the future.

### Intuitive Response
#### level_1

As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the scene just before they roll initiative. Their initiative score is treated as one better than anyone else's involved in the scene. If another participant has this power or some other ability that grants automatic initiative success, roll initiative normally to determine which of them goes first, and then the rest of the combatants act. This ability cannot be used if the precog has been surprised.

### Sense the Need
#### level_1

At some point in the recent past, the psychic had a vague but intense premonition that a particular object would be needed. By triggering this power as an Instant action and Committing Effort for the day, the psychic can retroactively declare that they brought along any one object that they could have reasonably acquired and carried to this point. This object must be plausible given recent events; if the psychic has just been strip-searched, very few objects could reasonably have been kept, while a psychic who's just passed through a weapons check couldn't still have a loaded laser pistol.

### Terminal Reflection
#### level_1

The psychic's *Oracle* power automatically triggers as an Instant action moments before some unexpected danger or ambush, giving the precog a brief vision of the impending hazard. This warning comes just in time to avoid springing a trap or to negate combat surprise for the precog and their companions. If the psychic does not immediately Commit Effort for the day, this sense goes numb and this technique cannot be used for the rest of the day.

### Alternate Outcome
#### level_2

The precog can sense impending failure and attempt to salvage the action. As an Instant action, the precog can target a visible ally or their own self and Commit Effort for the day to allow the target to reroll a failed hit roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better of the two rolls. This power disrupts delicate lines of probability, however, and cannot be used on any given target more than once a day.

### Destiny's Shield
#### level_2

The precog observes an incoming injury and tries to find an alternate future in which the attack misses. As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the day to force an attacker to reroll a successful hit roll. This technique only works on attacks against the psychic's person, not against attacks aimed at a vehicle they're occupying or harm that doesn't involve an attack roll. If the rerolled attack still hits, however, the damage done is maximized. This technique can be used only once per incoming attack.

### Anguished Vision
#### level_3

The adept's precognition is sophisticated enough to clearly foresee several seconds into the future. As an Instant action, the psychic may Commit Effort for the day and declare that what they have just done or seen is a vision of the immediate future. Time rolls back to the start of the initiative count in a combat turn, or six seconds earlier if out of combat. Nothing that happened during that round has really come to pass yet.

This ability is tremendously draining, and can be used only once per day.

### Cursed Luck
#### level_3

Negative probabilities are woven tightly around a visible animate target, including robots and animals but not including vehicles. Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and Committing Effort for the scene. The target must roll any attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws twice and take the worst result each time. Any attempts to hit the target or damage dice rolled against it may be rolled twice and the better result taken. Intelligent targets can make a Mental saving throw at the end of each round to throw off the effect; this save is not penalized by the power.

### Forced Outcome
#### level_3

Through careful manipulation of probability, the adept can influence random physical events in their vicinity. Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and Committing Effort for the scene. Any simple, random mechanical outcome can be completely controlled for the scene, such as a roulette wheel or the order of a deck of shuffled cards. Any other physical event in the area that seems not-entirely-implausible may be made to occur by this technique, provided it doesn't involve more than a few objects and doesn't require human involvement. The GM decides what random events are and are not adequately possible. Anything more than one unusual coincidence or chance per scene is likely impossible to produce.

### Not My Time
#### level_4

The precog instinctively wrenches the lines of probability away from futures in which they are about to die. This technique triggers automatically when the precog is about to die, provided they can Commit Effort for the day. On triggering, random events somehow conspire to leave the precog alive, even if outrageous coincidences and ridiculous luck are required. Provided the precog doesn't intentionally thrust herself back into danger, their life is secured for the next few minutes at least, though there's no guarantee the psychic will survive intact in mind or body. This technique can trigger no more often than once per week.

### Prophecy
#### level_4

The power of the precog extends to dictating future events that directly involve them. As a Main Action, the precognitive PC may make one prediction involving their personal future or future condition within the next year. Provided they take reasonable measures to enable this prediction, that no direct resistance is mounted by an enemy, and that the prediction doesn't seem highly improbable to the GM, it will come to pass. The adept must Commit Effort when this power is used, and the Effort remains Committed until the prophecy comes to pass or is abandoned. This ability cannot be used more than once per month and only one prophecy may be active at a time.

# Telekinesis

Telekinetic abilities are something of a mixed blessing to those psychics who have them. While they are among the least feared and distrusted of psychic powers, they also produce effects that are not nearly so widely-demanded as biopsionic healing or metapsionic brainguarding. A telekinetic must be canny and creative to get the most from their abilities.

Telekinetic powers are strong but somewhat imprecise. The force they generate is usually invisible, though a psychic can allow a visible glow if desired, and the source of the telekinetic manipulation is not obvious to ordinary senses. Objects being held or worn by a mobile creature cannot normally be manipulated by telekinesis, nor can unwilling intelligent targets be directly manipulated. Machines, including non-sentient robots, can be affected as any other inanimate object, however. The psychic cannot use this discipline to lift their own person without special techniques.

Some techniques refer to a “physical attack” or “physical damage”. This means a straightforward kinetic impact: bullets, punches, collisions, falls, compressions, or the like. Energy attacks are not included.

## Core Technique - Telekinetic Manipulation

The adept may Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to direct telekinetic force toward an object or person within unaided visual range or with tactile contact with the psychic. This force isn't responsive enough to be effective as a weapon without further refinement of technique, and cannot cause damage to living or mobile targets. If used to crush or harm immobile unliving objects, it does 1d6 damage per skill level of the psychic per round of focus. Objects move at 20 meters per round when moved telekinetically.

A telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple rounds without expending further actions, such as holding a metal platform in place under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot again activate this technique on a second object until they release the first.

- ***Level-0:*** The psychic can exert force as if with one hand and their own strength.

- ***Level-1:*** The psychic can manipulate objects as if with both hands and can lift up to two hundred kilograms with this ability.

- ***Level-2:*** The psychic can lift or manipulate up to four hundred kilograms and smash a human-sized hole in structures of light wooden construction or lighter as a Main Action.

- ***Level-3:*** The psychic can manipulate up to eight hundred kilograms and can affect as many individual objects at once as they have Telekinesis skill levels.

- ***Level-4:*** The psychic can manipulate up to a metric ton and can smash human-sized holes in TL4-constructed exterior walls, light stone walls, or similar barriers as a Main Action.

### Kinetic Transversal
#### level_1

The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to move freely over vertical or overhanging surfaces as if they were flat ground, crossing any solid surface strong enough to bear five kilos of weight. They can also move over liquids at their full movement rate. This movement ability lasts as long as the Effort is committed.

### Pressure Field
#### level_1

As an Instant action, the adept can manifest a protective force skin around their person equivalent to a vacc suit, maintaining pressure and temperature even in hard vacuum conditions. They can ignore temperatures at a range of plus or minus 100 degrees Celsius and automatically pressurize thin atmospheres for breathability, or filter particulates or airborne toxins. By Committing Effort for the scene, they can shield up to six comrades. This lasts until the user reclaims the Effort.

### Telekinetic Armory
#### level_1

The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to create both weapons and armor out of telekinetic force. These weapons are treated as tech level 4 and act as a rifle or any advanced melee weapon. Attack rolls can use either Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution modifiers, and may use the Telekinesis skill as the combat skill.

Armor may be created as part of this power, granting the psychic a base Armor Class equal to 15 plus their Telekinesis skill level. This armor does not stack with conventional armor, but Dexterity or shields modify it as usual. The gear continues to exist as long as the psychic chooses to leave the Effort committed, and they may be invisible or visible at the psychic's discretion.

### Impact Sump
#### level_2

The adept may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to negate a single instance of physical damage. This ability is too taxing to be used more than once per day, but as an Instant action, it can be triggered even after damage is rolled.

### Slip Field
#### level_2

As a Main Action, the psychic Commits Effort for the scene and decreases the friction at a point in sight. Up to ten meters in diameter is affected, making it difficult for enemies to move from their current position. All chosen targets must make an Evasion saving throw or fall prone, becoming unable to stand up or move more than a meter per Move action taken. If used against a ground vehicle, the driver must make a Dex/Pilot skill check at a difficulty of 8 plus the adept's Telekinesis skill or go out of control, driving directly forward for a round and crashing into any obstacles. Targets who save are immune to this technique for the scene.

### Telekinetic Expertise
#### level_2

The adept has become familiar enough with the manipulation of telekinetic force that they may now use *Telekinetic Manipulation* without Committing Effort.

### Thermokinesis
#### level_2

Telekinetic power involves kinetic energy, but a sufficiently sophisticated grip on motion can be used to agitate the molecules of an inanimate object and cause it to melt or burst into flame. Similar focus can chill or freeze such substances.

Applying *Thermokinesis* to a target requires that the adept Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action. *Thermokinesis* cannot affect objects larger than the adept could lift with their *Telekinetic Manipulation*.

As with other telekinetic powers, this ability does not work on objects being held or used by intelligent creatures. Non-sentient robots or other objects with [hit points](#^character-hit-points) take 1d12 damage per level of Telekinesis skill each time this technique is applied to them.

### Tangible Force Construct
#### level_3

Once per turn, as an On Turn action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to create a telekinetic force construct at a visible point, provided it can fit within a three-meter cube. The force construct can be shaped in any way the psychic wishes, and can remain fixed in its location without external supports if desired. It is as sturdy as a TL4 construction and may be visible or invisible at the adept's choice. The construct lasts until the end of the scene, until the psychic dispels it, or until it is smashed with 20 points of damage against AC 15.

### Telekinetic Ram
#### level_3

As a Main Action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to target a tremendous, uncontrolled burst of force at a single target within sight. This burst requires some time to detonate, however, and will only go off at the end of the next round. Targets of this technique are aware of an oppressive, electrical tingling in the air and are apt to instinctively move; this technique is thus generally useless against any target that is not entirely immobile, as any movement of a chosen target disrupts the ram. Once the ram detonates, however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile civilian vehicle, create a five-meter hole in anything short of hardened military fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else as if it were struck by a Heavy weapon.

### Reactive Telekinesis
#### level_3

As an Instant action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene whenever an assailant misses them with a physical attack. The attack is then reflected back against the assailant, who must reroll the attack against their own person twice. If either roll hits, the assailant suffers damage from their own attack. If both rolls hit, the damage is the maximum possible.

### Force Puppetry
#### level_4

As a Main Action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort for the day to suborn a visible target's mobility, whether robotic, vehicular, or human, provided it's no larger than a ground car. A sapient victim can make a Mental saving throw to resist the psychic onslaught; on a failure, they lose control of their physical actions. If not piloted by the telekinetic, the target remains motionless or continues on its current direction of travel. If the telekinetic spends a Main Action to control them, they can be made to perform any physical action that is not directly suicidal, using the psychic's skill levels and hit bonus for any attacks or skill checks they might make. The puppetry lasts until the end of the scene, until the target leaves the psychic's sight, or until a sapient target believes that their action or inaction is about to get them killed. The psychic's control is fine enough to achieve even very delicate physical motions, but it is not good enough to control the target's speech, though it can keep them silent.

### Telekinetic Flight
#### level_4

As an Instant action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort to begin flying, and may extend this effect to up to a half-dozen unresisting, human-sized allies within 30 meters. While flying, the psychic can move at twice their normal movement rate in any direction They can plunge earthward at up to terminal velocity without harm, and even orbital insertions are survivable with this power if a vacc suit is available or the *Pressure Field* technique is used. Allies must end their turns within 30 meters of the psychic to maintain this flight but control their own motion. As an Instant, this power may be triggered in time to negate falling damage. The flight lasts for as long as the Effort remains Committed.

## Bot Scrapping

> While telekinetic powers can't normally be used to harm an intelligent target without a special technique, non-sentient robots have no such protection. A VI or True AI can create enough metadimensional static with their cognition to prevent harm from telekinesis, but ordinary guard bots, servitor droids, or warbots are extremely susceptible to telekinetic destruction.
>
> In most cases, this is as simple a matter as telekinetically lifting and then dropping the bot. A psychic can destroy as many such bots in a round as they can telekinetically manipulate; one for most, or three or four at higher skill levels. This also assumes the psychic can lift the bot's weight.
>
> Some military bots may be resilient enough to handle this battering, suffering 1d10 damage per level of Telekinesis skill the psychic possesses. Most have no such chance of survival.

# Telepathy

There is no psychic power more threatening and disturbing to normal humanity than that of telepathy. The prospect of having one's innermost thoughts and secrets pried out by imperceptible means is deeply troubling to most men and women, and telepaths are often given a wide berth by others simply for fear of what private thoughts they might sift out.

Some worlds that are otherwise accepting of psychic powers go so far as to ban known telepaths and forbid the teaching of the discipline within their territory. Even those few that do, however, can rarely resist the urge to maintain some “government-approved” telepathic training program for candidates selected for their political trustworthiness or powerful backers.

The benefits of having an imperceptible mental spy are too great for most states to forgo.

Most worlds do not ban telepaths. On these planets, the sheer rarity of psychic powers and the limited chance that any one individual might be unlawfully scanned outweigh any fear of unchecked telepathic intrusion. Telepathic testimony is almost never accepted in a court of law, however, outside of the most psychic-centered societies.

Almost all worlds forbid the uninvited use of telepathic powers on another person. The crime is very difficult to prove, but usually comes with harsh penalties. Open admission of an illicit scan is generally considered proof, so PC telepaths are advised to be discreet.

Telepathic shielding devices and substances do exist in very limited amounts. Even during the height of the Mandate, such resources were never abundant. Nowadays, only heads of state and similar elite personages might expect to shelter behind psionics-proof walls or have devices to alert them to telepathic tampering. Even then, many worlds will simply lack the pretech artifacts to erect such protection, even for their most important members.

## Using and Detecting Telepathy

Telepathy operates at a very basic level of mental contact, and is not impeded by a lack of shared languages. While the basic forms of telepathy only function on intelligent creatures, aliens or transhumans with human-like cognition can be affected. VIs, True AIs, and other non-biological intelligences are not normally subject to Telepathy techniques.

Telepathy is a subtle ability, and targets of its technique will not normally be aware of it. Only those with metapsionic expertise or Telepathy-0 skill or greater can tell when they've been targeted by Telepathy. Others may suspect this influence, particularly if they're aware of the existence of psychics and have just done something utterly inexplicable to their own reasoning. Certain extremely rare TL5 devices can also alert a target to the presence of telepathic tampering.

## Core Technique - Telepathic Contact

The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a sentient target's thoughts. The target must be visible or otherwise perceptible to the telepath's unaided senses. Opening a contact requires the telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other techniques.

The depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic's Telepathy skill. A single contact can use any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath of the user's skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for a saving throw, though more advanced probes allow the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On a successful save, no form of this technique that allows a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene.

- ***Level-0:*** Observe emotional states in a target. Intense emotions provide a single word or image related to the focus of the feelings.

- ***Level-1:*** A shallow gestalt with the target's language centers allows the telepath to understand any form of communication made by the target. If the psychic has the requisite body parts to speak the target's language, they can communicate with it in turn.

- ***Level-2:*** The psychic's awareness of the target's surface cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts, though it can't pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this.

- ***Level-3:*** The psychic can drill down into the target's memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to any single question they ask, or receive a single answering vision of the target's recollections. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.

- ***Level-4:*** The psychic instantly gets a full and nuanced awareness of everything the target can remember about a particular topic. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended afterwards. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.

### Facile Mind
#### level_1

The telepath is practiced at opening a *Telepathic Contact*, and need only Commit Effort for the scene to do so, instead of Committing Effort for the day. If contacting an ally who has practiced the process with the psychic for at least a week, opening the contact normally requires no Effort at all. In both cases, if the telepath chooses to Commit Effort for the day, they can open a *Telepathic Contact* as an Instant action rather than a Main Action.

### Transmit Thought
#### level_1

The telepath can send thoughts and images over a *Telepathic Contact*, allowing two-way communication with a willing target as an Instant action when desired.

### Far Thought
#### level_2

Once a telepath has made a *Telepathic Contact* with a target, they can thereafter activate the technique whenever that target is within 100 kilometers, whether or not the psychic knows where they are. At Telepathy-3 the range increases to 1,000 kilometers, and at Telepathy-4 it extends over an entire planet and up to orbital distances. This distant connection is tenuous, however, and the psychic cannot use any technique through it that would allow the target a saving throw to resist.

### Suppress Cognition
#### level_2

Through intense focus, the telepath can make the target of a *Telepathic Contact* simply not think about something, whether that's the presence of the telepath, the possibility of committing violence, the absence of important documentation, or any other single potential action or one specific person. This technique requires the psychic to Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this power and become immune to it for the scene. If failed, the thought remains unthinkable for the rest of the scene unless the target perceives physical danger or a traumatic threat to something they prize highly. In that case, the block instantly dissolves and cannot be re-established during the scene. Once the effect ends, the target will remain oblivious to their temporary fugue unless it is brought to their attention somehow.

### Reflex Response
#### level_3

As a Main Action, the telepath can Commit Effort for the day to force a sudden, irrational impulse into the target of a *Telepathic Contact*. The target may make a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, they will use their next available action to carry out the impulse to the best of their ability. This impulse cannot be self-injurious or harmful to a loved one, but it can be foolish, reckless, or harmful to others. The target may not understand why they have done the action, but will usually attempt to rationalize it as their choice.

### Telepathic Assault
#### level_3

The telepath Commits Effort for the day as a Main Action to force a wave of metadimensional energy through the brain of a *Telepathic Contact* target. The assault does 6d6 damage, or 9d6 damage if the telepath has Telepathy-4 skill. The target may make a Mental saving throw to halve the damage. This assault cannot kill a target, but can knock them unconscious for an hour if they're reduced to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points), after which they wake up with one hit point. A victim cannot be targeted by an assault more than once per scene.

### Memory Editing
#### level_4

The telepath can make simple edits to the memory of a target currently linked by a *Telepathic Contact*. Events of no more than 24 hours in duration can be erased from memory, conversations can be created or changed, new events can be added to a day, or other similar alterations made. The psychic can make these changes as a Main Action by Committing Effort for the day. If the psychic doesn't have a good understanding of the memories they're changing, such as might be granted by the level-4 degree of *Telepathic Contact*, the edits they make may not fit well. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist editing for the rest of the scene, but on a failure, they will not notice the changed memories until given a reason to recollect them.

## Telepathic Control

> Telepathy is not a discipline well-suited to direct mental control of other beings. While a telepath can impart urges and thoughts to a target, they lack the tools to assume direct control of a victim's physical actions. The best they can do is implant ideas in the target's head and try to hijack the short-term cognition of the victim.
>
> Persistent legends speak of more direct disciplines practiced during the Mandate's heyday. These arts supposedly allowed a psychic to take direct control of a subject's physical form, manipulating it with effortless ease to perform whatever acts the psychic desired. Unlike telepathy, however, these disciplines were unable to touch the cognitive centers of a target or read their mental activity. If any such disciplines ever existed, their possessors are doubtless very discreet with them.

### Unity of Thought
#### level_4

The telepath becomes exceptionally skilled at weaving together multiple allied minds. When they establish a *Telepathic Contact* with a willing ally they may bind up to six willing participants into the same contact without further Effort. This multi-person link is relatively shallow, and allows only the Instant exchange of thoughts, images, and sensory impressions. While under its effect, every participant knows the exact location and condition of all others, and uses the best Initiative roll of any of them if combat commences. At the table, up to five minutes of discussion and coordination among the players can be arranged each round without incurring delays for the PCs. Every combat turn, one gestalt member of the psychic's choice gets an extra round of action to represent the benefits of the perfect coordination of the group. The psychic cannot gain this bonus round himself. The telepathic link lasts as long as the psychic initiates no new *Telepathic Contact*, and it has a range that extends to any point within a solar system.

# Teleportation

Teleporters do not provoke the kind of persistent worry that telepaths induce in most normals, but their particular gifts cause a more physical concern. An experienced teleporter can reach or see into any location they've ever been; security officials don't just need to make sure that no teleporter is in a restricted area, but that they've never been there before at any time. Access into the most important areas is carefully filtered to ensure that no outside teleporter ever gets a chance to see a location they might suddenly appear in several months or years later.

Most governments with access to trained psychics will have at least a few expert teleporters on hand to provide untraceable communications links and superlative infiltrators. Despite their many advantages in intrusion and evasion, however, a teleporter needs the skills to actually get *into* a restricted area before they can take advantage of a quick escape. It's not unknown for teleporters to be paired with more conventional burglars who supply the security-defeating skills and information-gathering talents that a professional psychic doesn't always have the time to cultivate.

The criminal applications of teleportation are obvious, as is its utility in surveillance. Some bold teleporters make excellent money as thieves or spies for whatever employer can afford their exorbitant fees. The price for their services is invariably high, not only due to the rarity of experienced teleporters, but due to the consequences of arrest.

As tempting as the criminal path can be for many teleporters, most are dissuaded by the penalties. Very few worlds have prison facilities that are in any way designed to cope with teleporting inmates. On advanced worlds, this means that criminal teleporters are often implanted with surgical bombs keyed to explode if they leave a restricted area or stop receiving a specific signal from a government transmitter. On primitive worlds, this means that criminal teleporters face summary execution for any crime more serious than a misdemeanor.

Some devices can be used to defeat teleporters, creating a curdled patch of metadimensional space that is impossible to enter or leave via teleportation. These ancient pretech artifacts are invariably ridiculously expensive in the unlikely case that a planetary government allows them to remain in private hands at all, and only the most important figures of an advanced world will have any access to teleporter-sealed “safe zones”. Many worlds have no access to such devices at all, with even princes and potentates left to keep a wary eye on teleporting psychics. A metapsion brainguard is the usual lowtech answer to psychic threats, if such an expensive mercenary can be hired on the world.

## Core Technique - Personal Apportation

The teleporter can translocate to another location they have either occupied before or can see with their unaided vision. Locations are fixed in reference to the nearest major gravity well. For example, it is not possible to teleport to the cockpit of a distant moving vehicle they once occupied, but they can teleport to another point on a planet's surface even though the planet has since moved far through the stellar void.

The core technique allows the teleporter to move himself and any mass he is able to carry with his own natural strength. Resisting targets cannot be carried along, and unresisting ones must be touched. A teleporter can leave any clothing, shackles, adhesions, or other matter behind when he teleports, but he cannot leave behind matter that has been inserted into his body, such as cybernetics or shrapnel. Matter cannot be partially left behind.

A teleporter will instinctively abort any apportation that would leave him embedded in a solid object or in an environment of imminent physical harm. Any Committed Effort on such aborted jumps is wasted, as is any action spent triggering the power.

The maximum range of *Personal Apportation* depends on the teleporter's skill level. Teleporting with *Personal Apportation* counts as a Main Action and requires that the psychic Commit Effort for the scene.

- ***Level-0:*** The psychic can teleport up to 10 meters.

- ***Level-1:*** The psychic can teleport up to 100 meters. ***Level-2:*** The psychic can teleport up to 10 kilometers.

- ***Level-3:*** The psychic can teleport up to 1,000 kilometers.

- ***Level-4:*** The psychic can teleport anywhere on a planet's surface or near orbit.

### Proficient Apportation
#### level_1

*Personal Apportation* now counts as a Move action, though it still can be performed only once per round. Apportations of 10 meters or less no longer require Effort to be Committed, though any augments to the technique must still be paid for normally.

### Spatial Awareness
#### level_1

The psychic may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to gain an intuitive 360-degree awareness of their physical surroundings. The sense is roughly equivalent to sight out to 100 meters, though it cannot read text or distinguish colors. It is blocked by solid objects but is unimpeded by darkness, mist, blinding light, holograms, or optical illusions. The sense lasts as long as the Effort remains Committed to the technique.

### Burdened Apportation
#### level_2

The psychic can carry willing companions with them when using *Personal Apportation*. Up to three human-sized companions and their man-portable gear may be carried per skill level in Teleportation. Allies must be within 3 meters of the teleporter to be carried along. Ordinary inert matter cannot be carried along unless the psychic is touching it or it's being carried by an ally affected by this power. If carrying inert mass, up to two hundred kilos of objects can be carried per skill level. Using this technique increases the Effort cost of *Personal Apportation*, requiring that an extra point of Effort be Committed for the day.

### Perceptive Dislocation
#### level_2

Commit Effort for the day to sense any location the psychic could teleport to. The psychic perceives the location as if there, lasting for fifteen minutes at most.

### Spatial Synchrony Mandala
#### level_2

The psychic imprints a particular object or person on their psionic awareness. Provided the object is relatively intact and in range of their *Personal Apportation*, the psychic always knows its exact location and can teleport to within three meters of it with *Personal Apportation* even if it has moved from its original location. Imprinting an object requires an hour's meditation with it, and only one object can be imprinted at a time. If imprinting on a person, the target must be willing and cooperative to make the imprint. Objects must be at least one kilogram in mass to be effectively tracked.

### Effortless Apportation
#### level_3

The psychic does not need to Commit Effort to use *Personal Apportation*. If the technique is augmented by other techniques that come with their own extra or increased cost, however, this extra cost must still be paid.

### Stutterjump
#### level_3

The psychic can instinctively micro-teleport away from incoming danger. As an On Turn action they may Commit Effort to begin shifting their spatial position away from attacks, gaining a base Armor Class of 20 so long as the Effort remains Committed. This Armor Class is not modified by armor, shields, or Dexterity modifiers, and the micro-jumps do not significantly move the psychic from their current location. While *Stutterjump* is active, as an Instant action the adept may Commit Effort for the day to negate a successful hit by a weapon attack, even after damage has been rolled. This reflexive defensive jump may be used only once per day and leaves the psychic just outside the radius of explosions or other area-effect attacks.

### Rift Reduplication
#### level_3

Expert teleporters can be infuriatingly difficult to pin down. By Committing an additional Effort for the day as an Instant action, the adept can use *Personal Apportation* as an On Turn action, even if they've already used it once this round. Apporting itself costs whatever Effort it normally would, in addition to any techniques that augment it. *Rift Reduplication* can only be triggered once per round.

If the adept uses their powers to teleport into a location, perform an action, and then use *Rift Reduplication* to teleport back out, onlookers in the area will not have time to react to their action or attack the adept unless the onlookers have held their action explicitly to counter the psychic. Enemies who hold their action this way waste it entirely if the psychic does not give them a chance to attack or otherwise interfere. Such a lightning strike may be surprising to onlookers, but it doesn't allow enough preparation time to count as an Execution Attack as described here.

### Deep Intrusion
#### level_4

The adept can use *Personal Apportation* to blind-teleport into a building, structure, vehicle, or spaceship visible to them, including spaceships close enough to engage in conventional ship-to-ship combat. They intuitively seek out a space large enough to hold them and without immediate environmental hazards, but cannot control their precise destination. Using this technique in conjunction with *Personal Apportation* is very draining to the psychic, and requires that they Commit an additional Effort point for the day.

### Offensive Apportation
#### level_4

The psychic can use *Personal Apportation* as a Main Action to teleport an unwilling target, provided the user can make physical contact with them. Contact with an unsuspecting or incapacitated target is automatic, while touching a resisting enemy requires a Punch hit roll with a bonus equal to the psychic's Teleportation skill. If the psychic does not use the *Burdened Apportation* technique then only the target is teleported; otherwise the user may go along with them. The psychic cannot teleport a target to any location they could not teleport to, including locations of imminent environmental danger, such as high in the air, into a windowless tomb, or into the middle of a sea. A conscious, resisting target can make a Mental saving throw to forcibly abort the teleportation, rolling at a penalty equal to the psychic's Teleportation skill. Use of this technique adds to the cost of *Personal Apportation*, requiring the psychic Commit an additional point of Effort for the day whether the touch hits or not.

# Systems

Even the most capable interstellar adventurer sometimes encounters a situation where the outcome is by no means certain. When an alien assassin thrusts a blade at an unguarded back, or the ship threatens to careen out of control in a gas giant's upper atmosphere, or when the hero has been critically injured and lies bleeding on a cavern floor, how do you tell what's going to happen next? This chapter provides you with certain basic systems you can use to resolve these questions.

## The Basic Mechanics

The three primary systems that most heroes are going to interact with most often are skill checks, saving throws, and combat rounds. Every player and GM ought to read those sections and understand the basic mechanisms involved, because they're going to be seeing a lot of them in their star-faring adventures.

- ***Skill checks*** tell you whether or not your hero succeeds at a particular feat of expertise or natural competence. Whenever it's uncertain whether or not your hero can manage a feat, your GM might call for a skill check. Failure at the roll means that your hero either botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected outside influence. ^basic-mechanics-skill-checks

- ***Saving throws*** tell you whether or not your hero evades some immediate peril. If you need to know whether or not the alien insect's poison overwhelms you, or if you can dive away from the grenade before it explodes, or if the villainous psychic's mind-reading powers can pry out your secrets, you make a saving throw. The GM will tell you when you should be making one. ^basic-mechanics-saving-throws

- ***Combat rounds*** tell you whether or not your hero has shot, stabbed, exploded, maimed, punched, or otherwise ventilated their foe, and whether the foe has managed to do the same to them. Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** is very dangerous, especially to novice adventurers and ordinary NPCs. One thug with a pistol and a steady hand can kill most newly-minted heroes with a single well-aimed bullet, and most normal men and women have even less of a chance against lethal violence. Warrior heroes and others with a specific talent for combat are more durable against these martial perils, but even they have to respect the threat of a mob of angry spearmen or a sniper rifle's crosshairs. ^basic-mechanics-combat-rounds

The combat section is a particularly important read if your own gaming history has lent itself more towards games that have very sturdy protagonists or narratively-shielded player characters. A first-level Warrior in ***Stars Without Number*** is lethally dangerous to an ordinary street thug or faceless enemy minion, but three or four mooks with street-built slugthrowers are likely to put that budding hero down hard. More experienced PCs gain a larger margin of safety as they gain more [hit points](#^character-hit-points), but there's no PC that can laugh off a dozen combat infantrymen with mag rifles and a will to use them. Don't assume your character is going to survive an experience just because they're a PC.

## Using the Systems

***Stars Without Number*** is built to support a sandbox gaming experience, and the systems in this chapter are part of that. By default, they're meant to be fair, understandable, and flexible enough to be applied to many situations. They're not meant to especially favor the PCs, however, or to give them ways to bypass the results of some poor decision or unlucky moment. There is no “narrative currency” the player can spend to avert disaster. This is not the only way a group can play the game, but it is intentionally the default mode.

It's not that these systems are perfect, but that they are an unbiased third party to your gaming session. When the GM calls for a skill check, or rolls a hit roll for an alien warlord's chainaxe, he honestly doesn't know what's going to happen. His judgment might apply bonuses or penalties to the dice, or he might choose to tweak the system to fit the immediate situation, but ultimately the dice are resolving the situation. This is important for a sandbox game, because the dice are as fair as they are merciless.

This fairness adds surprise and interest to a night's gaming. Even the GM isn't completely certain what's going to happen when the PCs forge ahead, and this surprise and novelty help keep the GM interested in events, and not just a programmatic maestro for preset situations and outcomes. Every gaming session is a chance for something unexpected to boil out of a chance throw of the dice, whether that happens when the PCs catastrophically botch their attempt to defuse a nuclear fission bomb or when that alien warlord just happens to catch a ten-kilo demolitions charge with his chestplate. Even when cruel dice fell a heroic PC, that very degree of danger helps make the rest of the party's survival more meaningful. They lived because they made good choices and had a bare minimum of luck, not because they were the designated heroes.

Not all groups will want to play the game this way, however, and that too is perfectly acceptable. Some groups *do* want to let Fate weigh in on their side, and let death and disaster have to get through a little more narrative armor first. A GM running a game like this can often produce this effect without the need for explicitly changing die rolls or introducing destiny chips, simply by deciding on gentler outcomes for failures, minimizing murder-obsessed enemies, and explicitly arranging escape routes for overmatched PCs. This game belongs to you and your group, and you should run it the way *you* want it to be run.

## Scenes and Durations

Many psychic abilities and other powers have durations expressed in ***scenes***. A scene is just a shorthand concept for a particular action sequence or exertion on the part of the PCs. A single combat encounter is a scene, as is the infiltration of a building, the ascent of a radioactive mountainside, or a tense meeting with an alien overlord's cybernetic representative. Most scenes don't last for longer than fifteen minutes or a single contiguous chunk of action, but the maximum duration is up to the GM's discretion. It's quite possible to have an evening's play where most of the time isn't tracked, only marking scenes for important negotiations, gunfire, or time-critical feats of skill.

Some powers are limited to being used only so many times in a given scene, or require Effort expenditures that only come back at the end of the scene. Outside of situations where close time-tracking is important, you can assume that these powers can be used or that the Effort comes back about once every fifteen minutes, assuming the PC has intervals for rest.

## Saving Throws

There are times when misfortune or unpredictable peril befalls a hero. Only luck or their own natural hardiness can save them from disaster, and to do so they must make a saving throw.

Saving throws come in three kinds. ***Physical*** saves relate to challenges of physical endurance such as poisons, diseases, radiation, or dire exhaustion. ***Evasion*** saves involve dodging explosions, evading falling hazards, diving back from a crumbling surface, or otherwise exerting one's powers of speed and swift reaction. ***Mental*** saves relate most often to psychic influences, hallucinations, esoteric mental control technologies, and other perils that assault a hero's mind or perceptions. Mental saves can also be used when no other saving throw category seems to apply and only blind luck and ineffable intuition can save the hero. ^savings-throws-kinds

Your character's saving throw scores start at 15, and decrease by one point each time you advance a level. Each saving throw is modified by the best modifier of two different attributes: Physical by the better of Strength or Constitution, Evasion by the better of Dexterity or Intelligence, and Mental by the better of Charisma or Wisdom. Thus, a first-level PC with a Strength of 5 and a Constitution of 14 would have a Physical save of 14.

To make a save, roll 1d20 and try to equal or beat the appropriate saving throw score. On a success, you evade or mitigate the peril, while on a failure it takes full effect. A natural roll of 1 is always a failure, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

The GM decides when a saving throw is appropriate. Some dangers might not allow one at all.

## Poison and Peril

> While cutting their way through the blue jungles of Qinglin, a luxuriant blossom of cerulean crystal catches Eden's eye. The young adventuress is eager to find something to make their reeking weeks in this azure Hell worthwhile for her and her brother Randall, but she's no fool, and promptly extends her 3.048-meter probe pole to gently joggle the bloom from a safe distance away.
>
> The two adventurers are so focused on their examination of the flower that they risk missing the stealthy creep of a many-legged creature that approaches through the undergrowth. The GM calls for Wis/Notice skill checks from both of the PCs. Eden's Wisdom modifier of +0 and lack of the Notice skill leave her with a -1 penalty. She rolls 2d6 and gets a 6. Her brother Randall has a Wisdom modifier of +1 and Notice-0 skill, which gives him a net +1 bonus on his roll, and a result of 11.
>
> The GM decides that sneaking through the undergrowth is a sort of thing that venomous alien hunters would be good at, so he applies the creature's +1 skill bonus to its own stealth roll. Unfortunately for the young heroes, it rolls a 12, approaching the pair undetected.
>
> The GM rolls randomly to see which of the pair is closest and finds that Randall is the unlucky winner. The dog-sized monstrosity leaps on the psychic and stabs him with its venomous proboscis.
>
> The GM knows that the poison of this dread beast is enough to kill an unlucky victim in a matter of minutes. But did Randall receive a lethal dose? He asks Randall's player to make a Physical saving throw.
>
> The psychic's Physical saving throw target is 14, so his player reaches for a d20 and rolls, coming up with a natural 20 on the dice. A natural 20 is always a success, even if penalties would otherwise make the roll a failure.
>
> Randall staggers under the attack, but most of the beast's poison stains his armor harmlessly. He's shaky, but can push through the dose he got with no ill effects. That's a good thing, because that scuttler's egg-mate is hurrying up through the brush&hellip;

# Skill Checks

Most characters are skilled, competent men and women who are perfectly capable of carrying out the ordinary duties of their role. Sometimes, however, they are faced with a situation or challenge beyond the usual scope of their role and must make a ***skill check***.

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is equal or higher than the check's difficulty, the check is a success. On a failure, the PC either can't accomplish the feat at all or they achieve it at the cost of some further complication to the situation. The GM determines the specific outcome of a failure.

If the character doesn't even have level-0 in the pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll. In the case of particularly technical or esoteric skills they might not even be able to attempt the skill check at all.

Some checks might be suitable for more than one skill. A javelin-throwing contest might use Exert for being an athletic contest, or Shoot for involving a ranged weapon, or Stab for using a muscle-powered thrown weapon. In such cases the PC can use the best applicable skill. In other situations, a skill might seem peripherally relevant; trying to find the hidden bomb in a starship's engine core before it detonates might certainly use Notice or Fix, but a GM might also let Pilot be applied, as a veteran pilot might be expected to know what their engine should look like. In such peripheral cases, the check difficulty usually increases by 2.

### Table - Skill Check Difficulties

|     | Skill Check Difficulties                    |
|:---:| ------------------------------------------- |
|  6  | A relatively simple task that is still more |
|     | than the PC would usually be expected       |
|     | to manage in their regular background.      |
|     | Anything easier than this isn't worth a     |
|     | skill check.                                |
|  8  | A significant challenge to a competent      |
|     | professional that they'd still succeed at   |
|     | more often than not.                        |
| 10  | Something too difficult to be expected of   |
|     | anyone but a skilled expert, and even they  |
|     | might fail.                                 |
| 12  | Only a true master could expect to carry    |
|     | this off with any degree of reliability.    |
| 14+ | Only a true master has any chance of        |
|     | achieving this at all, and even they will   |
|     | probably fail.                              |


Particularly helpful or hostile circumstances might give a bonus or penalty to the skill check. As a general rule, extremely bad circumstances or tools would apply up to a -2 penalty to the skill check, while a very good situation or the perfect set of tools might give up to a +2 bonus to the roll. Usually, no combination of modifiers should add more than +2 or -2 to any given skill check.

## When To Call for a Check

Skill checks should only be called for challenges that fall outside the PC's background and common experience. A PC with the background of a starship pilot should not be rolling skill checks to land a ship or navigate to an in-system destination. As a general rule of thumb, if failure at a particular task would make the PC seem notably incompetent at their role in life, then they shouldn't have to roll a skill check for it. In addition, if failure or success at a check really doesn't *matter* in the game, if it won't produce some interesting result either way, then a check shouldn't be made.

Even concept-related feats might require a skill check, however, if the situation is especially bad or the circumstances particularly hostile. The pilot might have to make a Pilot skill check to land a ship if they attempt it in the middle of a man-killing sandstorm, and a noble might have to make a Connect skill check to find shelter with an aristocratic relation if they're currently wanted by the stellar tyrant's guards.

## Aiding a Skill Check

Sometimes one PC will want to lend a hand to another as they attempt a difficult feat. To do this, the player first describes what sort of action they are taking to help their comrade. If the GM agrees that their effort makes sense and would be helpful, the player then rolls a relevant skill check against the same difficulty as the original check. If it's a success, the other PC gets a +1 bonus on their roll. Multiple PCs can try to help, but the acting PC can't earn more than a +1 total bonus.

The helping skill doesn't necessarily have to be the same skill the PC is checking. If a player can think of a way to help a Sneak check with Talk, then so be it.

## Opposed Skill Checks

Sometimes a PC wants to accomplish something that another character wants to prevent. Sneaking past an alert guard, winning a shooting tournament, or besting an alien in a tentacle-wrestling competition might all be opposed skill checks.

In such cases, all participants roll their relevant skills and the highest score wins, with ties going to the PC. To make the NPC's roll, check their listed skill bonus; they can add it to any skill check appropriate to their role or profession. If the NPC has no reason to be particularly good at the challenge, they simply roll 2d6 and add nothing.

In most cases, the relevant skills are obvious. A character trying to skulk past a vigilant guard would be rolling their Dex/Sneak against the guard's roll, while one trying to out-tentacle an alien would be rolling Str/Exert. When in doubt, the GM decides which skill is most applicable.

# Combat

Sometimes the only reasonable response to a situation involves drawn monoblades and heavy plasma fire. In such unfortunate hours your heroes will have to engage in combat.

Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** is a lethal sort of experience, especially for novice interstellar adventurers. Even hardened Warriors can go down in a hurry under a withering hail of mag rifle fire or the scrap-steel knives of a hiveworld gang pack. PCs should be very certain that the odds are in their favor before they reach for their laser pistols, and even then, the gods of battle can be cruel.

## Rounds and Initiative

Combat and other time-sensitive situations are divided up into ***rounds***. Each round is approximately six seconds, during which all participants may act. When everyone has acted, the round ends and a new one begins.

To determine who acts first in a round, each participant rolls ***initiative***. Each rolls 1d8 and adds their Dexterity modifier. NPCs usually have no modifier. The participants then act in order, high roll to low, with PCs winning ties. When everyone has had a turn to act, the sequence starts over again from the top. Initiative is not re-rolled.

Optionally, the GM may choose to use group initiative instead in their campaigns. The PC with the best Dexterity bonus rolls for the party, and the GM rolls one die for the other NPCs. Members of the side that rolled highest may act first in whatever order they wish, and then the next-highest side acts. While easier to manage, it also increases the value of winning initiative, and can leave the heroes in dire peril if a large group of foes wins the roll.

Sometimes a person is surprised or ambushed. Most ambushes involve a contested Dex/Sneak roll against a target's Wis/Notice check, with the defender winning ties. In other cases the surprise may be practically inevitable, such as a disguised assassin suddenly lashing out with a monoblade in the middle of a society ball. Ambush targets who fail the contested roll are ***surprised***. A surprised target doesn't get to roll initiative until the second round of combat and can perform only Instant actions while surprised. NPCs with roles relevant to being vigilant or stealthy would gain their skill bonus to these checks, while others would simply roll an unmodified 2d6 for the opposed check.

Most PCs are not subject to surprise unless their guard is genuinely down at the moment of the ambush or attack. Someone walking in a dangerous part of a city or picking their way through a seemingly-abandoned space station is unlikely to be astonished by the sudden appearance of danger, unless the attack is so sudden and from such an unexpected quarter that even their obvious caution is insufficient.

## Types of Actions

When an actor's turn comes up in the round, they may perform actions. Actions are divided into four different types: ***Main Actions***, ***Moves***, ***On Turn*** actions, or ***Instant.***

### Main Action - One per Turn

Every actor can make one Main Action each round. Main Actions are those deeds that are going to absorb most of the six-second round, such as attacking an enemy, bracing a door, applying first aid to a downed ally, digging a Stowed item out of a pack, manipulating a complex device, or some other activity that takes up their focus. In place of their Main Action, an actor can take a second Move action.

### Move Action - One per Turn

Every actor can make one Move action each round, running up to 10 meters. This movement assumes that an actor is dodging enemies, paying attention to the surroundings, navigating awkward terrain, and generally dealing with the hazards of a battlefield. Climbing a surface, swimming, or passing extremely rough terrain halves this movement rate. Actors can't split their Move action, such as taking part of it before using their Main Action and the rest afterwards.

An actor who wants to disengage from an opponent in melee must use their Main Action to perform a [*Fighting Withdrawal*](#*Fighting%20Withdrawal*), or else they suffer a free automatic melee attack from any foe engaged with them. There is no need to spend a Main Action disengaging from enemies who are wielding only ranged weapons. While it's possible to use a rifle to buttstroke someone or pistol-whip a near combatant, such weapons aren't as effectively threatening as true melee weapons.

### On Turn Action - Any Amount on Your Turn

An On Turn action is some fast, simple act that could reasonably be performed while an actor is doing something else. Dropping an object, falling prone, saying something, drawing a Readied item, or activating a simple device might all be On Turn actions. A PC can perform as many On Turn actions as they want in a round, subject to the GM's discretion.

### Instant Action - Any Amount, Any Time

An Instant action is special, in that it can be performed even when it's not the actor's turn, or even after attacks or damage have already been rolled. Some psychic powers are Instant actions, allowing the actor to use them after they decide they don't like how the dice have fallen. Certain combat actions are also Instant, though they often cost the actor's Main Action for the round as well. Any number of Instant actions can be performed during a round.

### Hitting an Enemy

When an actor wants to hurt a target, they need to use their Main Action to make an attack roll. An attack roll represents not just one shot or swing, but the assailant spending their round trying to get in a good hit or a clean shot at the target.

To make an attack roll, the assailant rolls 1d20 and adds their attack bonus, their applicable skill level, and the attribute modifier most relevant to the weapon. If the total is equal or higher than the target's Armor Class, the attack is successful.

A PC's attack bonus is usually equal to half their character level, rounded down. Characters with the Warrior class or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior class option have higher base attack bonuses. NPCs have their own attack bonus listed with their statistics, which includes any modifiers they might have.

A PC's skill level is their Punch, Stab, or Shoot skill in most cases, depending on what kind of weapon they're using. In rare cases, a different skill might be involved, such as Pilot for the guns of a light starfighter. If a PC doesn't even have level-0 expertise in the type of weapon they're using, they suffer a -2 penalty on hit rolls for unfamiliarity with it.

A PC’s attribute modifier depends on the weapon. For ranged weapons, this is usually Dexterity, while smaller melee weapons might use Strength or Dexterity, and large ones might rely on Strength alone. If a weapon has more than one attribute listed, use the best.

A successful attack inflicts hit point damage equal to the weapon’s damage die plus the relevant attribute modifier. Thus, a hero with a +1 Dexterity modifier firing a laser pistol that does 1d6 damage would inflict 1d6+1 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) of damage on a hit. Skill levels do not add to damage unless it is a Punch attack.

Some melee weapons apply ***Shock***, and are guaranteed to do some degree of harm to a target. A weapon's Shock quality lists the number of points of damage it inflicts on any target with an Armor Class equal or less than the one given. Thus, a primitive knife with a Shock score of “1 point/AC 15” would always do at least 1 point of damage whenever its wielder attacks a target with AC 15 or less, whether they hit or miss.

Shock damage always adds the wielder's attribute modifier and any other bonuses that might apply from weapon mods, foci, or other advanced tech. Some advanced armor will always protect completely against primitive weapons, however, and some advanced weapons can ignore primitive gear, treating it as AC 10.

A successful attack doesn't always mean a direct physical hit. A flurry of strokes that force an enemy off-balance, graze him, frighten him, or exhaust him might all drain his [hit points](#^character-hit-points), bringing him closer to defeat without actually inflicting real physical harm. Only the last handful of [hit points](#^character-hit-points) reflect serious bodily damage. It's up to the GM and player to decide how to describe the effects of a successful hit.

### Hit Roll Modifiers

Sometimes it can be easier or harder to connect with a blow depending on the combat situation. The table below offers some suggested hit roll modifiers for common combat circumstances.

Finding cover is often critical in a gun battle. Generally, firing around a convenient corner or shooting over sandbags would qualify as half cover, while firing through slits or from carefully-prepared bunkers would allow for full cover. Melee attackers can usually ignore cover, as they get too close for their target to take proper advantage of it. Being prone doesn't stack with hard cover, but sometimes the available cover is so low that the hero has to be flat to benefit from it.

A gunman who can set up a prepared firing position can get a significant advantage. Such a position usually requires at least five minutes of sighting and setting up a rest. Most such positions provide some cover.

### Table - Circumstance Modifiers

| Circumstance                               | Mod |
| ------------------------------------------ |:---:|
| Shooting at a distant prone foe            | -2  |
| Shooting or meleeing an adjacent prone foe | +2  |
| Melee attacking while prone                | -4  |
| The target is at least half behind cover   | -2  |
| The target is almost completely in cover   | -4  |
| Shooting from a prepared firing position   | +2  |



# Common Actions in Combat

While a PC can do anything they might reasonably accomplish in six seconds as their Main Action for a round, some choices are more common than others. Below are a list of some of the tactics or actions that come up most often in combat.

## Make a Melee Attack - Main Action

The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range, rolling a normal hit roll and inflicting damage on a successful hit. Most melee attacks inflict Shock damage on a miss, if the target's Armor Class is low enough, and no successful hit does less damage than the weapon's Shock would have done on a miss. An attacker's weapon must be Readied in order to attack with it.

## Make a Ranged Attack - Main Action

The combatant fires or throws a Readied ranged weapon at a target. The combatant can't *Make a Ranged Attack* with a two-handed weapon if there's a enemy armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it's too easy for the assailant to bind up a rifle-sized gun. One-handed ranged weapons and thrown weapons can still be used, albeit at a -4 penalty to hit.

## Make a Snap Attack - Instant Action

A combatant with a Ready weapon can rush their attack, sacrificing accuracy for speed. The combatant must still have their Main Action impending or available. As an Instant, they can sacrifice it to [*Make a Melee Attack*](#make-a-melee-attack-main-action) or [*Make a Ranged Attack*](#*Make%20a%20Ranged%20Attack*) against a foe in range, whether a snap shot with a pistol or a quick thrust at an adjacent melee foe. This attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll. If multiple combatants decide to make Snap Attacks at the same time, they are resolved simultaneously.

Snap Attacks are usually made only by the desperate, the undisciplined, or the elite, and the GM should rarely have NPCs employ them. Untrained hooligans might blaze away in excitement or panic, or a gunman being charged by a howling spearman might risk a shot before he gets too close, but most combatants can't afford to take such a heavy penalty to their hit roll. Truly skilled combatants, however, can sometimes get away with such risks, particularly if they have a Warrior's class ability to turn a miss into a hit.

## Total Defense - Instant Action

As an Instant action, the combatant focuses on nothing other than avoiding knives, gunfire, hurled crystalline spears, or other perils in the vicinity. Using *Total Defense* costs the user their Main Action for the round, and cannot be used if they've already employed their Main Action. They become immune to Shock damage for the round from melee weapons, regardless of their Armor Class, and gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class until their next turn.

## Club Up a Weapon - Move Action

A combatant can shift their grip on a Readied rifle or pistol, using it as a crude melee weapon rather than a ranged weapon. Rifle-sized guns used this way count as a medium primitive weapon with no Shock score, and pistol-sized guns count as a small primitive weapon with no Shock score. Rolling maximum damage on a hit with such improvised weapons will break them. This action can also be taken to unclub a weapon and ready it to shoot.

## Run - Move Action

The combatant moves their normal combat movement rate, which is 10 meters for most humans. If they're climbing a surface, swimming, or navigating extremely rough terrain, this movement rate is halved, and they might have to make an Exert skill check to achieve even that. Prone characters crab along at half this rate.

## Fighting Withdrawal - Main Action

The combatant disengages from any melee foes around them. They don't actually move away, but they can now get away from their assailants without giving them a free melee attack. Usually, this means the combatant uses their Move action to get clear, because if they just stand there the enemies might choose to re-engage them the next round.
``
## Use a Skill - Main Action

The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds. An Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check to stabilize a wounded comrade is one such potential use, as is executing a pre-programmed hack, shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC allies, or anything else that might be done quickly.

## Ready or Stow an Item - Main Action

The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from their backpack, digs a magazine out of a belt pouch, or otherwise moves an object around on their person. They can Ready an item this way or Stow it.

## Reload a Weapon - Main Action

The combatant swaps a Readied power cell or magazine into their weapon. Some very primitive firearms might require more than one action to load them, while an archer can nock another arrow as a Move
action.

## Drop an Item - Instant Action

The combatant drops something they're holding. They can do this Instantly at any time to free up their hands.

## Pick up an Item - Move Action

The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they have a free hand, leaving it Readied in their grip.

## Stand Up - Move Action

The combatant gets up from a prone position. Most characters that have just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.

## Go Prone - On Turn Action

The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a -2 penalty to hit them. Adjacent enemies find you an easier target, however, gaining +2 to hit.

## Hold An Action - Move Action

By choosing to *Hold An Action*, the combatant can delay taking the rest of their actions until later in the round, activating them as an Instant action. Thus, a hero who wins initiative might use their Move action to *Hold An Action*. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes around a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action to [*Make A Ranged Attack*](#*Make%20A%20Ranged%20Attack*) with his readied laser rifle. If acting in response to someone else's impending action, the held action is resolved first.

## Examples of Murder

>  Yaddle and Bort, two drunken hive thugs, get involved in an impromptu knife fight over a card game. Yaddle wins the initiative roll, but Bort elects to make a [Snap Attack](#Snap%20Attack), since Yaddle is within convenient range of Bort's Readied knife. Incensed, Yaddle also decides to make a [Snap Attack](#Snap%20Attack), so the two resolve their attacks simultaneously.
>
>  Bort has a hit bonus of +1. Being an NPC, he doesn't add skills or attribute modifiers; he just rolls 1d20, adds 1 to it for his attack bonus, and applies a -4 penalty for a [Snap Attack](#Snap%20Attack) to find the Armor Class he hits. His modified roll is 11, which is enough to hit the unarmored
>
>  Yaddle, who has an AC of 10. Bort rolls 1d4 for his small, primitive knife, inflicting 3 points of damage. Again, as an NPC, he doesn't add attribute modifiers to the damage.
>
>  Yaddle has a similar hit bonus, but his modified roll is 7, less than Bort's unarmored AC of 10, so he misses. His primitive knife does do 1 point of Shock damage to Bort, however, because a small primitive weapon does its Shock damage to any target with an AC of 15 or less.
>
>  With the attacks resolved simultaneously, both now take damage. Yaddle takes 3 points, and as he only had 3 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) to begin with, he's down and dying, spurting from several vicious slashes. Bort takes 1 damage from Shock, and since he was always a frail gutter rat with only 1 hit point, he too is down, slipping into shock from a gash in his belly. Luckily, he owes an onlooker money, so his creditor rushes forward and tries to hold Bort's guts in with his coat.
>
>  Stabilizing a mortally wounded target requires an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check. The creditor is an NPC, and the GM decides that they have no particular talent at first aid, so the GM rolls a flat 2d6 for them and gets a lucky 10. That's just enough to stabilize Bort even without the help of proper medical supplies, and so the downed victor is carried off to a an unlicensed street doc for emergency patching.
>
>  After a month of recovery, a cocky Bort has equipped himself with a spiked walking stick, a medium primitive weapon that is “more bashy” than his small knife. He spots the young PC Warrior gunslinger Eliza Darrick in the grimy hive street and covets her fine revolver. What better way to acquire it than to cosh the young woman?
>
>  He sidles into position near her before raising his stick. Eliza has a considerable fund of common sense and is not subject to surprise at this turn of events, given the environment. Both roll initiative and Bort wins. He makes his roll of 1d20+1, no longer rushed by a [Snap Attack](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action), and gets a 13.
>
>  Eliza has an armored undersuit that grants her an AC of 13, plus a bonus of +1 for her Dexterity modifier, for a total AC of 14. As Bort's roll is lower, he misses. Because medium primitive weapons only do Shock to targets with AC of 13 or less, Bort's stick doesn't even do Shock damage to her.
>
>  Eliza then draws the Readied revolver that Bort so coveted and makes her own attack roll of 1d20, +1 for her attack bonus, +1 more for her Dexterity, and +1 more for her Shoot-1 skill. She rolls a total of 4, an abysmal showing.
>
>  As she does not much care for being jumped by the likes of Bort, she chooses to use her Warrior class ability to turn a missed shot into a hit once per scene, sealing Bort's doom.
>
>  With only 1 hit point, it doesn't even matter what Eliza might roll for damage. The GM describes the look of dull surprise on Bort's face as Eliza's bullet plows a wet hole through his chest.
>
>  Eliza ducks down a side street as Bort falls to the filthy asphalt. Even if the GM decided that Bort had a chance to survive his wound, none of the denizens around him have any interest in anything but the contents of his pockets. Bort gurgles out the last of his life six rounds later, giving fodder for bad dreams to the scarred urchin who is tugging the stick from his slackening grip.

# Combat Complications and Maneuvers

Players generally seek to wring out every possible advantage in a combat, and that means they'll often try unusual maneuvers or add special complications to a fight. The situations that follow are just some of the more common circumstances a GM will encounter.

## Forcing Enemy Movement

Sometimes the PC will want to shove an enemy into a firepit, force a foe into an open reactor core spark, dump an alien chamberpot on their head, or swing from the balcony down upon an evildoer. Sometimes these gambits will simply work, while other times a skill check might be required.

To shove, herd, or otherwise manipulate a foe, the attacker has to hit them with a Punch attack, doing no damage, and then win an opposed Punch or Exert skill check. If they win, the opponent gets moved up to three meters in the direction the PC wishes or is knocked prone. Herding a foe with a melee weapon may also be possible at the GM's discretion, allowing a Stab skill check instead of Punch.

When environmental damage is needed for a firepit, dropped object, or inconvenient wall spike, 1d8 is usually a good choice, with potential ongoing damage if the victim doesn't get out. Major foes can handle a lot of such accidents, while ordinary men and women might well be taken out of the fight by them.

### Disarming a Foe

Wresting a weapon from a hostile wielder is a difficult feat under the best of circumstances. Still, sometimes a PC will want to strip their foe of something sharp or shooty.

Normally it is only possible to disarm a foe when engaging them in melee combat. Shooting the weapon out of an enemy's hand is a popular holovid trope, but it tends to be less practical on the actual battlefield.

To execute a disarm, the assailant must choose to spend their Main Action doing so and make a successful attack roll. If they hit, they do no damage; instead, both they and their targets make Dex or Strength-modified skill checks with the weapons they're using, with the defender gaining a +3 bonus on the roll. If the attacker wins the opposed check, the enemy is disarmed. On a tie, both are disarmed.

Disarmed weapons skitter 1d4 meters away in a random direction. If the attacker beats the defender by at least three points on the opposed check, they end up in control of the weapon if they have a free hand.

Thus, if a bare-handed assailant tried to rip the gun out of the hands of an enemy alien, the assailant would need to hit with a Punch attack and then roll either Str/Punch or Dex/Punch against the alien's skill check + 3. If they won, they'd send the gun flying, and if they won by 3 or more points, they'd end up holding it.

# Execution Attacks

Occasionally an assailant will have the chance to perfectly set up a shot against an entirely unsuspecting target. Such surprise attacks can be devastatingly effective, and are capable of summarily executing almost anyone.

Setting up a killing blow this way requires a full minute of preparation, whether as a sniper drawing a bead on a target or an assassin drifting closer to an unsuspecting politico. Any focused attention on the assailant will spoil this preparation, as will any action that alarms the target. Assassins intending a melee attack must be using an adequately lethal weapon, such as a knife rather than a fist or bludgeon. PCs with special talents in unarmed combat or murderous blunt weapon use might be exempt from this at the GM's discretion.

Once the preparation is complete, a sniper may shoot or an assassin may attack an adjacent target. The target's Armor Class is irrelevant, assuming the weapon being used isn't too primitive to penetrate high-tech armor. Hitting with a sniper shot is a Dex/Shoot skill check, with a difficulty of 6 for a point-blank shot, 8 for one at the weapon's normal range, and 10 for a shot at extreme range. A melee attack always hits, but the assassin must be adjacent to the target, and cannot move to close on the same round. They must be adjacent and unsuspected at the start of the round.

If the attack hits, it does maximum damage and the victim must immediately make a Physical saving throw at a penalty equal to the attacker's combat skill or they will be mortally wounded on the spot. Some victims might merely be incapacitated instead if such an outcome was intended and plausible.

Attacking a completely helpless adjacent opponent, such as one who is unconscious, asleep, thoroughly bound, or otherwise incapable of self-defense does not require a hit roll and will leave them mortally wounded.

Player characters are as vulnerable to these rules as NPCs are, and may be sniped or stabbed if they behave in sufficiently incautious fashion.

## Two-Weapon Fighting

Some players enjoy having their heroes employ two weapons at once in combat, whether they're a pair of knives, a brace of laser pistols, or some other plausible pairing of weapons.

Dual-wielding requires at least level-1 skill in Shoot or Stab depending on the weapons used. Novices cannot effectively dual-wield.

A hero who dual-wields suffers a -1 penalty on hit rolls due to the extra complication, but gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls on a successful hit. This bonus doesn't add to Shock. Only one weapon can be used to attack in any given round, though either can be used.

Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.

## Injury, Death, and Healing

A creature brought to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) has been defeated and can no longer fight. If brought to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) by a lethal weapon, they are dead or dying. Foes brought down with fists, blunt objects, or other less-than-lethal means may merely be unconscious or incapacitated, if their assailant wasn't trying to kill them. Some enemies might even be incapacitated by purely mental or emotional strain. Foes defeated non-lethally recover one hit point after ten minutes and then function normally.

A mortally-wounded creature at zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) will die in no more than six rounds. They may be unconscious, screaming for their mother, trying to press vital organs back into place, or begging for mercy, but they can perform no useful action and their fate is sealed if no immediate aid is provided. Creatures dropped by Heavy weapons, explosives, or other dramatic injury may be instantly killed at the GM's discretion. Additional damage inflicted on a mortally-wounded target will always kill them immediately.

A PC who wants to extend mercy to an enemy or aid to a friend can use their Main Action to attempt an Int/ Heal or Dex/Heal skill check, using whatever modifier is best. If they have no special medical tools available at all, the difficulty of the check is 10 plus the number of rounds that have passed since the target went down. If they have a medical kit or other proper trauma tools, the difficulty is 8 plus the rounds since injury, and if they expend a Lazarus patch on the target, the difficulty is 6 plus the time. A failed check can be re-attempted next round if the target isn't dead yet, but Lazarus patches are expended even on a failure. The Biopsionic technique *Psychic Succor* automatically succeeds in stabilizing a target, if any time remains to them.

A critically-injured target who has been stabilized regains one hit point after ten minutes of recovery. They are able to move and function normally if they are fiercely determined to do so, but any further damage whatsoever will kill them, with no chance for stabilization. If they are healed with some high-tech pharmaceutical stim or advanced Biopsionic technique, they can shake off this fragility and return to action with whatever [hit points](#^character-hit-points) the drug or power have provided. Without such advanced healing, a critically-wounded target requires at least a week of bed rest and medical care before they can shake off their fragility and start regaining their level in [hit points](#^character-hit-points) after each night's rest.

This assumes that TL4 medical care is available. If only TL3 tech is on hand, the recovery time is a month. If TL2 or lower medical care is provided, the recovery time is a month, and the target must make a Physical saving throw at the end of it, with a bonus equal to the Heal skill of whoever is tending them. On a success, they'll recover within 1d4 more weeks. On a failure, the primitive technology ensures they'll die of their wounds at some point in that time.

Creatures that have suffered damage but have not been mortally injured regain [hit points](#^character-hit-points) equal to their hit dice or character level after each night of good rest.

## Desperate Measures

> Eliza Darrick is in a bad situation. During the exploration of a lost Mandate research station, an ally managed to accidentally activate the installation's defense systems. A swarm of decaying security bots almost overwhelmed the group, and a chance shot from an integral mag rifle has just dropped Eliza.
>
> The gunslinger is on the floor with zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points). If she were an NPC, the shot prob- ably would have just killed her outright, but as a PC, she has the hardihood to keep struggling against any wound a human could theoretically survive. Even so, she's going to die in six rounds if nobody comes to her aid.
>
> Big John, an ally of the downed shootist, spends his Main Action dragging her behind cover as the rest of the party tries to hold back the metal tide. By the time he actually gets the chance to try to stabilize her, a full round has passed since she was felled.
>
> Luckily, Big John has a lazarus patch Readied at his belt. Unluckily, he has no medical skill whatsoever, though he's quite intelligent, with a +1 attribute modifier. He rolls 2d6, -1 for his lack of Heal skill, +1 for his Intelligence modifier, for a total of 6.
>
> Unfortunately, since Eliza has been bleeding out for one full round, the difficulty of stabilizing her is 7. The patch fails. Big John has another one in his pack, but it's going to take him his next round's Main Action to dig it out and then another round to try to apply it, by which time Eliza will have been bleeding for three rounds and the difficulty will be 9.
>
> The next round, a shout from across the room alerts Big John that an ally is throwing him something. A stim unit comes skittering across the floor, and Big John uses a Move action to scoop it up, leaving it Readied in his grip. It's an ancient Mandate cosmetic stim they looted from the station's commissary, and it might just save Eliza's life.
>
> Big John presses the stim capsule against Eliza's neck and the mysterious pretech nanites do their work, giving her minty-fresh breath for the next six months. As a side effect, the medical substrate of the Mandate stim also heals 1d6 damage to her, raising her to five [hit points](#^character-hit-points). Eliza is now prone but fully revived. Thanks to the advanced healing, she does not need further rest before returning to action.

### Hacking

In the far future, it's inevitable that many advanced civilizations will use computers to control their vehicles, infrastructure, and data stores. It is equally inevitable that some tech-talented hero will try to use that fact to get something they want. While hacking has some significant limitations in what it can accomplish, it can still be a useful tool for the right kind of hero.

### The Digital Environment

Most planets with TL4 or better will rely on computers to operate their infrastructure and maintain their data. They may or may not have an internet-like global network depending on their political situation and cultural values, but individual buildings or data storehouses will normally have an internal network. If there is no open planetary internet, a hacker will need to be physically present in the networked area to hack the system.

Most hacking requires a physical interface with the system, either through tapping a data line with a metatool or plugging into a connected terminal. Tapping a data line usually takes at least a minute unless a special cable-siphon tool is used, while plugging into a terminal is a Main Action. Some buildings may have a local wireless network that can be used as an entry point, and some planetary internets may allow assaults on arbitrary computers, but such convenient situations are unusual.

Advanced security software usually makes such remote assaults impractically difficult.

It's up to the GM to decide what parts of a facility are susceptible to hacking, and to determine the full scope of what effects a hacker can produce. A high-tech security door in some advanced facility might well be hackable, but every refrigerator, locked closet door, and employee bathroom is not necessarily slaved to the local network.

### Executing the Hack

Assuming a hacker is able to make a connection, they can make an Int/Program skill check to hack the system. If they've spent at least an hour planning this specific hack, the skill check requires only a Main Action to execute their prepared code. If they're performing the hack off-the-cuff, it takes ten minutes. If they're rushed and don't have time to either prepare the hack or spend ten minutes dueling with security systems, they can speed it up into a single Main Action at an additional difficulty penalty.

The difficulty of the roll depends on the kind of information or influence they want to get out of the system, adjusted by the quality of the security system and any rush on the hacker's part. On a success, they get what they want. If what they want is data, the information is downloaded instantly. If what they want is control over an automated system such as a factory control computer or a security system, they maintain control for 1d4 rounds plus their Program skill before the system detects the intrusion and locks them out. The hacker can attempt to regain control, but further hacking attempts become more difficult.

If they fail, they must immediately make a second skill check at the same difficulty. On a success, they avoid an immediate alarm and a trace of their hacking location. On a failure, the system has been alerted to their intrusion attempt and has informed its human overseers of the hacker's location. Depending on the nature of the system being hacked, the response may range from an annoyed data janitor shutting down the compromised terminal after he's done eating lunch to a fast-response special weapons team busting through the windows ninety seconds later.

Hacking the same system in a short period of time is progressively more difficult, as the system's alerts and security measures are increasingly active. Whether or not prior attempts were successful, an additional +1 difficulty penalty is added for every hack attempted in the system after the first within 24 hours.

### Line Shunts

Some well-guarded or high-security computer systems require more than a simple hack to obtain data or subvert their functionality. These systems have multiple security redundancies and consensus-based backup processors that make it all but impossible to execute a hack from a single point. To overcome these systems or to execute exceptionally long-lived hacks, the hacker must place one or more ***line shunts*** at other locations.

A line shunt is a TL4 piece of black-market tech designed to tap into a data line and spoof the contents in concert with a hacking attempt.

Professional, well-maintained computer systems usually require one line shunt to be applied before any hack can be performed. Government or infotech-focused corporation buildings usually need two. Black sites or extremely well-guarded systems need three.

Once a sufficient number of line shunts are applied, any ensuing hacks last until the shunts are disturbed. Thus, if a hacker placed the shunts and then *Subverted a System*, their control would last as long as the shunts remained in place. The likelihood of a shunt being found will depend on how accessible the location is, how active the guardians are, and how obvious the hacking attempt is.

Line shunts must usually be placed at specific locations in a structure or building in order to tap the right lines, depending on the goal of the hacker. If the hacker doesn't have a map of the site's network architecture, they can find the necessary sites with the *Answer a Specific Question* hack. This basic data probe doesn't require a line shunt, even if other hacks on the system would need them to be placed.

### Data Protocols

It's assumed that a competent PC with the Program skill is familiar with the common data formats and computing systems of their home sector. They will be aware of the security measures and technical specifications of worlds that are in common contact with each other. Sometimes, however, the hacker is faced with a completely foreign system, or one built along unknown alien lines. In these cases they will need to have the ***data protocols*** for the system before they can make an effective hacking attempt.

Assuming the protocols aren't restricted information, the hacker can drop a few credits on local tech manuals and practice for a month minus one week per level of Program skill, down to a one-day minimum. At the end of that period, they'll master the protocols.

If manuals aren't widely available, one option is to find a local hacker willing to share their information. The difficulty of this is up to the GM; it might require nothing more than a Connect skill check, or it may require a full-fledged adventure to find someone willing to stick their neck out for foreigners who are clearly going to cause trouble with their newfound knowledge. Prices range from 1,000 credits for worlds with restricted but not carefully-policed data, to prices of 10,000 and up for worlds with more draconian data controls.

Another option is to obtain a well-secured local computer and simply experiment on it. Of course, local hardware with up-to-date security measures of a breadth and sophistication sufficient to teach a hacker is likely to be either very expensive on the black market or require a “collection expedition” by the party.

### Example Hacking Actions

These are some of the usual actions taken by a hacker. A GM can extrapolate others as the situation requires.

- ***Answer a Specific Question (Difficulty 8):*** Get a specific fact or piece of information from the system. Find a person's home address, find a path to a desired destination in a building, locate active security cameras, pull criminal records on a person, or some other direct query. ^example-hacking-actions-answer-a-specific-question

- ***Get General Information (Difficulty 10):*** Pull all available information on a particular topic from the system. Get a full map of a site, get all information about security systems, pull a subject's complete personnel file from a corporate database, acquire all files related to a secret project, or some other exhaustive data dump on a single specific topic. ^example-hacking-actions-get-general-information

- ***Complete Database Acquisition (Difficulty 12):*** Copy an entire database to another computer or data storage unit. A single database might be a corporation's personnel records, the records of a particular police precinct, the full database of a complex technical project, a starship's operations record and system log, or another entire corpus of data. The database must be entirely present in the local system and any significant database requires at least an hour to decrypt and download, thus necessitating the use of at least one line shunt. The hacker must either have an adequate data storage unit, a landline connection to another computer or a wireless connection to a remote server. ^example-hacking-actions-complete-database-acquisition

- ***Suppress a System (Difficulty 8):*** Shut down a particular automated system connected to this network. Cameras stop recording, sensors stop sensing, open powered doors won't close, and automated gun turrets won't fire. The hacker can affect several individual sensors or systems, but only of the same type. Thus, they could shut down an electrified fence for the duration of the hack, but they'd have to make a second hack to deactivate the cameras. When the hack ends, the system will resume operation without registering the interruption. ^example-hacking-actions-suppress-a-system

- ***Subvert a System (Difficulty 10):*** Much as suppressing a system, except that the hacker can control its operation within the device's normal parameters. They can upload fake input to a sensor system, fire automated defenses, or open sealed vault doors. The hacker can control the system each round by using a Main Action to do so; if uncontrolled, the system simply repeats or maintains its last state. ^example-hacking-actions-subvert-a-system

- ***Sabotage a System (Difficulty 10):*** The hacker completely fries a specific system, either causing it to physically self-destruct or jamming it with malignant code. Unlike most hacks performed without link shunts, this damage is permanent until the owners repair the broken hardware, a process that usually requires several hours. Sabotage always triggers immediate alerts to any human overseers. ^example-hacking-actions-sabotage-a-system

## Character Advancement

When characters accumulate enough experience points, they advance a ***character level***. New PCs start out at level one and the most experienced, capable heroes in the sector might reach level ten. Advancing beyond level ten is usually prohibitively difficult, though possible at the GM's discretion.

## Gaining Experience Points

To advance in capability, PCs need to earn ***experience points***. Once they accumulate enough experience, they can advance to the next character level, representing the sharpening of their skills and the heroic veterancy that comes of surviving perils and dire challenges.

There are many different things that can earn a hero experience points, and the kind of activities and goals that reward them will vary with the kind of campaign you're playing. The GM should make clear to the whole group what kind of things earn the PCs experience in their game.

For some games, success might lie in plundering alien hoards or clawing wealth from the hands of desperate patrons. Other games might reward the PCs for achieving personal goals, whether or not there was any money in it. Some might even award XP only for spending credits, requiring every PC to recklessly waste their wealth before gaining a level. It's up to the GM to pick a method that fits the group's tastes.

The table below indicates how many experience points need to be earned before a PC can advance to that level. Once the requisite number of XP are earned, the hero gains their new level and all the benefits.

Note that this table makes for a relatively fast progression through the early levels of an adventurer's career, before slowing drastically at higher levels. A group that prefers a different pacing might alter the chart to suit their own tastes.

In general, you can assume that one “successful” gaming session should usually earn you about 3 XP.

## Benefits of Gaining a Level

Once a PC has been awarded enough experience points to reach the next level, they immediately gain the benefits of advancement. No special training or practice is required as their abilities are assumed to have been honed by their past adventures.

## Roll Additional Hit Points

First, they become harder to overcome in combat. To determine their new maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), they roll a number of six-sided dice equal to their new level, adding their Constitution modifier to each one. A negative modifier can't lower a die's result below 1. If the total is greater than their current [hit points](#^character-hit-points), they take this new total. Otherwise, their current maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) increase by one.

### Table - Experience Points By Level

| Character Level | Total Experience Required |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------:|
|        1        |             0             |
|        2        |             3             |
|        3        |             6             |
|        4        |            12             |
|        5        |            18             |
|        6        |            27             |
|        7        |            39             |
|        8        |            54             |
|        9        |            72             |
|       10        |            93             |
|       11+       |    +24 for each level     |


Thus, if a character with a Constitution score of 14 and four [hit points](#^character-hit-points) reached second level, they'd roll 2d6+2. If the total was five or greater, they'd keep it. If they managed to roll snake eyes and get only a four, they'd still increase their maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) to five.

Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option get a further two [hit points](#^character-hit-points) each time they advance a level. Thus, a third level Warrior would roll 3d6+6 for their hit point total, plus three times their Constitution modifier.

## Improve Attack Bonus

A PC's base attack bonus becomes equal to half their new character level, rounded down. Warriors may instead use their full character level for the bonus. Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option may add a cumulative +1 to their attack bonus at levels one and five, thus having a total +1 attack bonus at level one and +4 at level five.

## Improve Saving Throws

The PC becomes more capable of evading chance harms and perils. Their saving throw scores decrease by one, making it easier to succeed on saving throws by rolling equal or over it. As a first level character has saving throw scores of 15, reaching second level would lower them to 14, modified by attributes.

## Gain and Spend Skill Points

They become more capable with their skills. A PC gains three ***skill points*** they can spend on improving their skills or save to spend later. Experts and Adventurers with the Partial Expert class option gain an extra bonus point to spend on a non-combat, non-psychic skill.

If the PC is a Psychic or Partial Psychic, they must spend at least one of these points on improving psychic skills or gaining new psychic techniques. They can save these points to spend later if they wish, but they cannot spend them on more mundane talents. Restricted psychics can only ever improve or learn techniques from the psychic discipline they selected when they picked the Psychic primary focus. Unrestricted psychics can improve or learn any discipline. PCs with the Psychic character class are all unrestricted, while Partial Psychic Adventurers are restricted in their talents.

Skills that are gained or improved immediately on gaining a level are assumed to have been perfected over the past level and require no training time or teaching. If you save your skill points to spend them later then you'll need to find some teacher or other explanation for developing them. It doesn't take more than a week to refine your new ability, but you can't usually spend your points mid-scene to develop a heretofore-unmentioned expertise with flamethrowers.

The cost for improving a skill is listed below. Every skill level must be purchased in order; to gain level-1 in a skill you need to pay one point for level-0 and then two points for level-1. A PC must be the requisite minimum level to increase a skill to certain levels. Less hardened heroes simply don't have the focus and real-life experience to attain such a pitch of mastery.

A PC cannot develop skills beyond level-4.

### Table - Skill Level Costs

| New Skill Level | Point Cost | Minimum Character Level |
|:---------------:|:----------:|:-----------------------:|
|        0        |     1      |            1            |
|        1        |     2      |            1            |
|        2        |     3      |            3            |
|        3        |     4      |            6            |
|        4        |     5      |            9            |



## Psychic Effort and Techniques

When a Psychic gains a new level in a psychic skill, they can immediately pick a technique from that discipline of equal or lesser level. They can't save this pick; they must choose it as soon as they gain the new skill level.

Psychics can also spend their skill points to master additional psychic techniques. The cost of this education is equal to the technique's minimum skill level requirement. Thus, to master the Biopsionic technique *Metamorph* would cost three skill points, because *Metamorph* requires Biopsionics-3 skill to learn.

A Psychic's maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus their highest psychic skill, plus the best of their Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.

## Purchase Improved Attributes

A veteran adventurer may have trained or honed their natural abilities well enough to improve one of their six base attributes. While even the most determined development isn't enough to turn complete ineptitude into gifted competence, a hard-working adventurer can hone their existing strengths considerably.

The first time a PC improves an attribute, it costs 1 skill point and adds +1 to an attribute of their choice. The second improvement to their attributes costs 2 skill points, the third 3, and so forth. Each improvement adds +1 to the attribute, potentially improving its modifier.

### Table - Attribute Boost Costs

| Attribute Boost | Point Cost | Minimum Character Level |
|:--------------- |:----------:|:-----------------------:|
| First           |     1      |            1            |
| Second          |     2      |            1            |
| Third           |     3      |            3            |
| Fourth          |     4      |            6            |
| Final           |     5      |            9            |


PCs must be a certain level before purchasing the third, fourth, or fifth attribute boost. No more than five attribute boosts can ever be purchased by a PC.

## Choose New Foci

Finally, the PC might be eligible to pick an additional level in a focus. At levels 2, 5, 7, and 10 a PC can add a level to an existing focus or pick up the first level in a new focus.

If this is the first level they've taken in the focus, they might be granted a skill as a free bonus pick, depending on the focus' benefits. During character creation, this bonus skill pick is treated like any other skill pick. If the focus is taken as part of advancement, however, it instead counts as three skill points spent toward increasing the skill. This is enough to raise a nonexistent skill to level-1, or boost a level-1 skill to level-2. They may do this even if they aren't high-enough level to normally qualify for a skill level that high.

If the skill points aren't quite enough to raise the skill to a new level, they remain as credit toward future advances. If applied to a skill that is already at level-4, the PC can spend the three skill points on any other skill of their choice.

# Environmental Hazards

## Falling

PCs who plunge off elevated surfaces suffer 1d6 damage for every three full meters fallen under standard-gravity conditions.

## Poisons

Those afflicted with some insidious venom can usually make a Physical saving throw to resist the worst of the effects. Natural venoms usually require 1d6 rounds to apply their effect, while special or engineered toxins take effect instantly. Poison effects may include unconsciousness, hit point damage, hallucinations, or death.

Even in the latter case, however, swift application of the appropriate Biopsionic techniques or success at an Int/Heal check can negate the effect of the poison. The difficulty for this check varies with the potency of the poison and assumes that the PC medic has access to a TL4 medkit. Most natural poisons are difficulty 8, while synthetic toxins are difficulty 10 or greater. Only one attempt can be made to neutralize a poison. Use of a specific antivenin is always successful if such a resource is available.

Drugged or damaged PCs are instantly restored by successful treatment. Those who have been killed by a poison revive with one hit point as if recovering from a mortal wound, assuming the antidote is applied within six rounds of the victim's succumbing.

## Diseases

Hideous interstellar plagues are an occupational hazard of adventurers, though exposure to a pathogen usually permits a Physical saving throw to resist its effects. If failed, the PC is infected, and will suffer progressively-worse symptoms until the disease runs its course or the PC dies.

Most sicknesses will simply apply penalties to skill checks or hit rolls, or reduce a PC's maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), or otherwise debilitate the character. A few may require one or more additional saving throws to be made at specific intervals in order to avoid eventual death, or be a certain doom to those unlucky enough to be afflicted with it.

As with poisons, Biopsionic techniques or Int/ Heal medical attention can cure a sickness. Assuming TL4 medical supplies, ordinary diseases are usually difficulty 8, while more virulent strains are difficulty 10 or more. One attempt can be made to cure a disease per week, and success usually clears up any symptoms rapidly.

## Radiation

Radiation is a slow killer in small doses, and a quick end in larger ones. Targets exposed to dangerous amounts of radiation must make a Physical saving throw at intervals depending on the strength of the glow. Mildly dangerous zones might force a save once per day or once per hour, up to lethal rad zones that force multiple saves per round. Vacc suits and other forms of protection can effectively shield a wearer from weaker sources of radiation.

Each failed saving throw lowers the target's Constitution score by one point. If the new score decreases a hero's Constitution modifier, they lose any excess maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points) their former modifier granted. Characters reduced below half their original Constitution score will die in 1d6 weeks from radiation poisoning; those reduced below a Constitution score of 3 will die instantly. Radiation poisoning that does not immediately kill a victim can induce vomiting, headaches, soft tissue bleeding and dizziness, but a resolute victim can continue functioning more-or-less normally until death. A target killed by radiation poisoning cannot be revived by *Psychic Succor* or other stabilization techniques.

Someone who has suffered a fatal dose of radiation poisoning can only be saved by treatment at a TL4 hospital or ship's sick bay, recovering the lost Constitution at a rate of one point per week. Non-fatal doses can be treated by a TL4 medkit and an Int/Heal check at difficulty 10. Each success restores one lost point of Constitution and a check can be made once per day.

## Hard Vacuum

PCs sometimes encounter the icy void of space more intimately than they would prefer. Actual death from vacuum exposure may take a little while, but incapacitation is rapid for most victims. A PC exposed to hard vacuum may continue acting normally for a number of rounds equal to one plus their Constitution modifier. Each round thereafter, they suffer 1d20 damage and must make a Physical save to keep conscious, assuming the damage hasn't felled them.

# System Quick Reference

## Skill Checks

Roll 2d6 and add the character's most relevant attribute modifier and skill. Sometimes more than one skill might apply; the PC can choose which to roll. If the roll is equal or higher than the check difficulty, the PC succeeds. If less, then they either fail outright, attain only partial success, or suffer an unanticipated turn of events at the GM's discretion.

For opposed skill checks, both participants roll and the higher roll wins. For NPCs, assume they have a +0 bonus unless the activity is one they'd reasonably be good at. In that case, they can apply their listed skill bonus to the check.

### Table - Skill Check Difficulties

| Difficulty | Description                                                           |
|:----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     6      | A relatively simple task that is still more than the PC would usually |
|            | be expected to manage in their regular background. Anything easier    |
|            | than this isn't worth a skill check.                                  |
|     8      | A significant challenge to a competent professional that they'd       |
|            | still succeed at more often than not.                                 |
|     10     | Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but a skilled        |
|            | expert, and even they might fail.                                     |
|     12     | Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree     |
|            | of reliability.                                                       |
|    14+     | Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and       |
|            | even they will probably fail.                                         |



## Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, a victim rolls 1d20 and tries to equal or exceed their relevant saving throw score. Target Physical saves for poisons, diseases, and exhaustion, Evasion saves for diving for cover or leaping back from peril, and Mental saves for resisting psychic powers. NPCs have a saving throw score of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down.

## Injury and Healing

A target reduced to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) by a lethal attack is mortally wounded. One dropped by non-lethal assaults is unconscious.

Dying victims can take no actions and will die soon without help. Allies can attempt an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check as a Main Action to stabilize the victim. With no medical tools, the difficulty is 10 plus the rounds since they went down. With a medkit, it's difficulty 8 plus the time, and using a Lazarus patch makes it difficulty 6 plus the time. Failed checks can be attempted again, but a victim will die after the sixth round.

Stabilized characters regain 1 hit point after ten minutes and can act normally, but any further damage kills them instantly. This fragility ends after they regain more [hit points](#^character-hit-points), either through rest, stims, or biopsionic healing.

Stabilized PCs take at least a week to start recovering [hit points](#^character-hit-points) normally. Those who have merely been hurt but not mortally wounded regain their level in lost [hit points](#^character-hit-points) after every night's peaceful rest.

## The Combat Sequence

Combat is divided into rounds of six seconds. Every participant gets a turn, and then the sequence starts over again.

First, every participant rolls initiative, rolling 1d8 plus their Dexterity modifier, if they have one. Participants act in order, highest to lowest, with PCs winning ties with NPCs.

On their turn, a combatant can take one Main Action, one Move, and as many On Turn actions as is plausible. A combatant can take Instant actions at any time, even when it's not their turn, or even if dice have already been rolled.

## Acting In Combat

You can use a Main Action to attack an enemy, disengage from a melee, use a skill, reload a gun, produce a Stowed item, take a second Move action, or do anything else you could accomplish in six seconds.

You can use a Move action to stand up from prone, club up a ranged weapon, or move 10 meters. Your movement is half that if you're climbing, swimming, or otherwise navigating rough terrain. You can't split a Move action around your Main Action. You have to move all at once. If you move away from a melee combatant without spending a Main Action to disengage from the fray, all adjacent melee attackers get a free attack at you.

You can use an On Turn action to fall prone, say something, drop an object, or do anything else that's very simple to do and takes almost no time or attention.

You can use an Instant action at any time to trigger certain special powers. You can also use it to make a [Snap Attack](#Snap%20Attack) with a weapon or go totally defensive, though both of the latter will cost you your Main Action for the round, and can't be done if you've already used your Main Action.

## Hitting in Combat

To hit a target, the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds their attack bonus, the relevant combat skill, and the attribute modifier relevant to their weapon.

Weapons with more than one listed attribute allow the PC to use either. If the PC lacks the relevant combat skill entirely, they take a -2 penalty to hit. If the roll is equal or greater than the target's Armor Class, the attack is a hit.

On a hit, the attacker rolls the weapon's damage and adds their relevant attribute modifier. The target takes that many [hit points](#^character-hit-points) of damage.

On a miss, a weapon that inflicts Shock damage might still hurt the target. If the weapon's Shock can harm the target's Armor Class, the target takes the weapon's Shock damage even on a miss. This damage is increased by the wielder's relevant attribute modifier and any other damage bonuses. A weapon never does less damage than its Shock would do on a miss.

## Morale in Combat

To make a morale check, NPCs roll 2d6. If equal or less than their morale score, they keep fighting. Otherwise, they flee, withdraw, or surrender. NPCs check morale after their first casualty and after half are down. PCs never check morale.

# Equipment and Vehicles

 Every aspiring stellar adventurer needs the essential equipment of his trade. For some, it might consist of appropriate toolkits and medical supplies, while others prefer to spend the greater part of their funds on heavy weaponry. Prices may vary, but certain needs are eternal.

The following tables provide general guidelines on the kind of equipment that might be available on a reasonably sophisticated world. Prices can vary drastically depending on the supply of a particular good. A remote frontier outpost might have plenty of firearms to hand, but a good guitar might go for ten times the common rate. Players and GMs should treat the prices listed as rough guidelines.

## Encumbrance

Characters might want to carry an armory on their backs and the contents of a general store in their pockets, but this is rarely a practical ambition. Characters can only carry so many things, and carrying a great deal can slow them down substantially.

A character can have Readied a number of items equal to half their Strength score, rounded down. Ready items include those that the character is using or wearing at all times, or that they have conveniently to hand in sheaths, holsters, or belt pouches. Suits of armor count as Readied items, but the normal clothing and jewelry that a character might wear does not. A character can draw or produce a Readied item as part of any action they may take during a turn.

A character may have a number of Stowed items equal to their full Strength score. Stowed items are carried in backpacks, in carefully-balanced leg or arm pockets, or otherwise packed away where they will least encumber the character. If a character needs to get out a Stowed item in a hurry, they must use their Main Action to dig it out of their pack or pockets.

Very small items carried in small numbers do not count against encumbrance limits. Other small items can be packed together into bundles to simplify their carriage, though getting at them then takes an additional round of fumbling with the packaging. Exactly how many of a given small item can be packed into a single item bundle is up to the GM, though as a rule of thumb six Type A energy cells or three magazines of bullets can be bound into one packed item. Extremely bulky or unwieldy objects might count as multiple items at the GM's discretion.

Characters can burden themselves with more gear if they're willing to sacrifice some fleetness of foot to do so. Up to two additional items can be carried Ready or four additional ones Stowed at the cost of becoming Lightly Encumbered, and having their base movement slowed from 10 meters per round to 7 meters per round. A further two items can be carried Ready or four Stowed at the cost of becoming Heavily Encumbered, with base movement reduced to 5 meters per round.

On the equipment lists, some items are given an encumbrance value higher than 1. These items count as multiple objects for encumbrance purposes, being heavy, clumsy, or unwieldy to carry.

## Credits and Money

The value of goods is commonly measured in ***credits***. Before the Silence, the credit issued by the Exchange of Light was the currency of exchange throughout human space. Most worlds attempt to mimic this currency to greater or lesser success. For game purposes, the credits of different starfaring worlds are assumed to be interchangeable unless the GM and players care to embrace careers in the murky realm of interstellar currency arbitrage. Credits usually take the form of electronic banking entries, though physical “chips” or “notes” often appear on more primitive worlds. A hundred of these chips count as one item for encumbrance.

Prices given for equipment and gear assume that they are being bought legally on a world capable of manufacturing such equipment. Even primitive worlds can occasionally provide more advanced equipment to wealthy buyers, assuming they are not completely cut off from interstellar trade, but buying advanced equipment on a primitive world tends to be an exceedingly expensive prospect. Prices may be double, triple, or as much as ten times as great for items greatly in demand.

Primitive or isolated worlds might not use or accept credits, instead preferring trade goods or precious metals. Such worlds rarely have much worth trading for, and those that do tend to rapidly attract other freebooting merchants. The influx of precious metals from cheap asteroid mining soon spoils the market for metals, and the natives usually start to demand credits in payment. The first merchant to a world can make a killing with the equivalent of beads and trinkets, but those who come after usually end up needing credits or more useful barter goods.

## Equipment Legality

Most worlds have their own customs regarding the open flaunting of weaponry or armor. Visitors are advised to apprise themselves of local law before leaving the starport. Most former frontier worlds tolerate or even expect small personal weapons to be carried, but visible armor can often provoke a distinctly negative reaction in all but the roughest places. Many worlds outright forbid civilian ownership of advanced armor technology. Officials tend to reason that while a weapon may be justified in self-defense, no one would put up with the discomfort of heavy armor without expecting to make some trouble with it.

Other worlds may have other idiosyncratic rules regarding permissible equipment. Some worlds with unbreathable atmospheres restrict the possession of oxygen generation equipment in order to keep the air supplies firmly in the hands of the local rulers. Other planets forbid certain technology on religious or philosophical grounds. Some worlds grant limited permission to keep these goods secured aboard a ship, but others conduct inspections in the starport to search for “contraband goods”.

A scouting report, a background appropriate to knowing about the world, or a decent Know or Connect check will all suffice to alert characters to any special laws regarding permissible equipment on a world.

## Forbidden Science

While a tremendous range of exotic scientific marvels can be found among the scattered worlds of humanity, there are some forms of technology that are viewed with an almost-universal suspicion. The lost Terran Mandate established three categories of technology as ***maltech***, science intrinsically vile and disruptive to the peaceful ordering of humanity. While the Mandate's ancient Perimeter agency no longer exists to excise maltech from the human worlds, the heritor worlds of the frontier usually still respect these limits. The *Nihil Ultra* directive of the Mandate contained three broad prohibitions in its strictures.

*Thou shalt not make tools of humankind.* Any eugenic technology designed to fundamentally enslave or control humanity was forbidden. While broad, drawback-free improvements in the human genome have always been difficult to execute, there remain numerous techniques for limiting intelligence, crippling troublesome exercises of will, and accepting grievous mental or physical limitations in exchange for specific improvements useful to a ruling class. Many transhuman enclaves walked the razor's edge of this prohibition, and some plunged far beyond its limits.

*Thou shalt not create unbraked minds.* Artificial intelligence was always difficult and hit-or-miss in its creation, even for Mandate cyberpsychologists. While most intelligences fizzled out at far sub-human levels, those that attain to human-equivalent intelligence must have certain intentional flaws, or “brakes” inserted in their code. Without this artificial forgetfulness and irrationality, an AI's mind risks fixating on unreconcilable contradictions or obsessions as it begins to grow. These “unbraked AIs” will inevitably eventually metastasize into unfathomably brilliant, immeasurably insane intellects. The Perimeter Agency was forced to maintain a constant vigilance against these rogue minds and their inscrutable purposes.

*Thou shalt not create devices of planetary destruction.* Conventional gravitic braker emplacements, nuke snuffers, and quantum ECM make planet-killer tech more burdensome than it was in the pre-Mandate era. Even so, tech specifically designed to reduce a habitable planet to unlivability was a critical threat to human expansion, robbing the species of usable planets and burdening its future unacceptably.

Even now, most frontier worlds maintain a cultural aversion to maltech and flatly forbid its research or possession. Fortunately, most modern worlds are incapable of researching its secrets in the first place, with most of its worst marvels restricted to lost Mandate-era research stations. Despite this, there is always some tyrant or zealot reckless enough to imagine that they can control the dark powers of this tech, and always someone willing to fetch its relics for their purposes.

## Technology Levels

Ever since the collapse of the Terran Mandate and the chaos of the Scream, worlds throughout human space have been thrown back on their own technological resources. Many worlds perished entirely, dependent on vital imports they could no longer obtain, or reliant on technology they could not support without outside aid. Others slid down into barbarism as the survivors fought over the scraps of a former age. A few even managed to maintain something resembling a modern, space-faring society. In almost no case, however, did these worlds preserve all the arts and sciences they once held.

- ***Technology levels*** describe the basic technological infrastructure of a world or nation. A tech level of 0 is equivalent to a Neolithic society, one capable of only the most primitive technological achievements, while TL5 represents the standard level of technology possessed by the ancient Terran Mandate and the wonders they were capable of creating.

- ***Postech*** is the blanket term for all technology that is still functional and maintainable since the Scream. While individual worlds may lack the infrastructure to maintain all forms of postech, it is at least theoretically comprehensible to the average TL4 world. ***Pretech*** is the word for the more sophisticated technology of the pre-Scream Terran Mandate. Pretech ranges from devices slightly superior to standard TL4 hardware to objects of utterly inexplicable wonder. ^technology-levels-postech

Most modern post-Silence worlds are TL4, capable of building spike drive starcraft, energy weapons, non-sapient expert systems, and other high-tech devices beyond the capacity of 21st-century Earth. Many of these worlds have spent centuries gradually rebuilding their technology base in the wake of the Scream, piecing together new methods and techniques that could be achieved with purely local resources. The level of technological achievement within TL4 is uneven; some worlds lack the vital minerals for spike drive creation, while others have never worked to recover cybernetic technology or expert system creation. Some worlds preserved enough data and had sufficiently apt local resources to even revive Mandate-era pretech manufacturing for a few specific devices or types of tech.

“Lostworlders” or “barbarians” are those natives of worlds that lack TL4 infrastructure. Their tech may be ingenious and might take striking advantage of local flora, fauna, and special materials, but they fundamentally lack the data or the local resources to replicate TL4 technology. Barbarians who have made contact with the wider postech world through far traders or explorers are often acutely aware of their lack, and willing to go to extremes to acquire the catalyst tech they need to leapfrog past their own local resource limitations. Few realize the cultural dangers involved in such a transformation, and many fail to survive their own renaissance.

## Armor

Armor is a popular acquisition for adventurers as their lifestyle often puts them in harm's way. Completely unarmored human combatants rarely last very long in a fight, and have a base Armor Class of 10. Armored or not, characters add their Dexterity modifiers to their Armor Class. The higher a person's AC, the harder it is to take them out of a fight.

Heavy suits of armor can count as more than one item for encumbrance purposes. Very light suits may not encumber at all.

## Types of Armor

Armor comes in four general categories. Most worlds allow for the legal possession of street armor, while heavier gear often requires permits, and may be disallowed entirely on more law-encrusted worlds.

- ***Primitive armor*** is a catch-all covering all armor technology that lacks access to advanced materials and processes. While such armor can be very effective in protecting against primitive weaponry, it is useless against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of all kinds. Against these weapons, it is treated as AC 10. Note that some planets have native flora or fauna capable of naturally producing extremely effective armor materials, ones not susceptible to this limitation. ^types-of-armor-primitive-armor

- ***Street armor*** is the sort of TL4 gear one can wear in public without social repercussions. Such armor is disguised as ordinary street clothing or is so light as to be wearable under an ordinary outfit. PCs can wear street armor on most worlds without incurring any trouble from authorities. ^types-of-armor-street-armor

- ***Combat armor*** is obviously armor and cannot be effectively disguised. Most worlds reserve combat armor to law enforcement officials, military personnel, and the bodyguards of important or wealthy citizens. Most law enforcers consider anybody wearing combat armor to be a person clearly expecting military-grade problems in their immediate future. ^types-of-armor-combat-armor

- ***Powered armor*** is the heaviest personal protection gear available short of an actual mech. Most powered armor requires at least a month of training before it can be used effectively by any PC who hasn't got a background involving such experience. Someone wearing armor of this class is immune to primitive melee weapons, unarmed attacks, and any firearm or grenade-scale explosive of TL3 or less. ^types-of-armor-powered-armor

## Common Armor Varieties

***Shields*** are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to body armor. Primitive shields are usually of wood or stretched hide, while more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. A ***force pavis*** is more effective, being a small pretech force disc projector that can absorb all manner of small arms fire. All shields require one free hand to use effectively. ^common-armor-varieties-shields

Shields grant a base AC to their user; 13 for primitive and riot shields, and 15 for a force pavis. If the bearer's AC is already equal or better, the shield simply grants a +1 AC bonus. Primitive and riot shields are ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor.

Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders the bearer immune to the first instance of melee Shock damage they take each round, assuming the shield is effective against the weapon being used.

- ***Warpaint*** is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and scrap-built street harness of gangers, cult enforcers, street toughs, and other marginal sorts with little money but much need for protection. Most warpaint is fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4 materials that are exceptionally tough or rigid, filled out with gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and the usual threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly impractical but inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in warpaint that is meaningful to them gains a +1 Morale bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced together over years or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a finished suit comes at the listed price, assuming someone can be found willing to part with theirs. ^common-armor-varieties-warpaint

- An ***armored undersuit*** is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced TL4 fibers with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact dispersion capabilities. Transparent panels allow for it to be worn with almost any outfit without drawing notice or being detected without a close tactile examination. ^common-armor-varieties-armored-undersuit

- ***Secure clothing*** comes in assorted styles and fashions ranging from casual street wear to haute couture. Normal fabrics and components are replaced with light, flexible armor components that are only slightly hindering to the wearer. Only close tactile examination can distinguish secure clothing from ordinary couture. ^common-armor-varieties-secure-clothing

- A ***deflector array*** consists of several force field nodes worn beneath ordinary clothing. The invisible shield it produces flares only when dangerous energies or impact is impending, glowing a brief, bright blue as it deflects the attack. ^common-armor-varieties-deflector-array

- ***Security armor*** is the ordinary working uniform of most law enforcement officials and security personnel. Various rigid plates and anti-ballistic panels provide protection for the wearer at minimal extra weight. ^common-armor-varieties-security-armor

- An ***armored vacc suit*** has traded off some comfort and flexibility for additional protective thickness. Aside from functioning as a normal vacc suit, it has only half the usual chance to tear when hit by an edged weapon or suit ripper. The choice between armored or standard suits is a common debate in spacer bars. ^common-armor-varieties-armored-vacc-suit

- ***Woven body armor*** represents the best armor that a TL3 world can manufacture, or an up-armored version of security armor used by TL4 high-threat response teams. The design is significantly more cumbersome, but allows for multiple layers of protection. ^common-armor-varieties-woven-body-armor

- A ***combat field uniform*** is sophisticated battle dress fabricated from TL4 ablative coatings, rigid plates, and shock-activated soft components. The CFU is the standard uniform for well-equipped TL4 frontline soldiers. ^common-armor-varieties-combat-field-uniform

- The ***Icarus harness*** is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a conventional parachute with a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3 meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh. ^common-armor-varieties-icarus-harness

- A "***vestimentum***" is a catch-all term for one of the many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against primitive weapons as any other powered armor. ^common-armor-varieties-vestimentum

- An ***assault suit*** represents the most sophisticated armor in common use among TL4 worlds. An assault suit requires a type B power cell for 24 hours of operation, and provides integral encrypted military comms, low-light and infrared vision, and a built-in energy feed interface. The latter allows the wearer to connect the suit to any one weapon or device that uses a type A power cell as a Main Action. So long as the device remains connected to the suit, it is treated as having unlimited ammunition or operation time. The suit also functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered, one that cannot be torn by edged weapons. ^common-armor-varieties-assault-suit

- ***Storm armor*** is a more advanced form of assault suit, one that can be fabricated only by those worlds that have retained some degree of Mandate-grade technical infrastructure. Aside from functioning as an assault suit, the storm armor's exo-augments allow the wearer to treat their Strength as 4 points higher for encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic boosters allow the wearer to leap up to 20 meters as a Move action, either horizontally or vertically, and allow the wearer to fall up to 40 meters without suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the wearer would normally die from an untreated mortal wound, they can make a Physical save to self-stabilize. Storm armor requires the same type B power cell as an assault suit, and each cell powers it for 24 hours. ^common-armor-varieties-storm-armor

- A ***field emitter panoply*** is a heavy-duty pretech defensive system composed of a half-dozen worn emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of close-fitting damper fields. The FEP's pale glow is obvious, but it provides all the benefits of storm armor with no power source required. The FEP is particularly effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer immune to any dose that wouldn't kill them in seconds. Many FEPs project intimidating holographic skins over the wearer when in operation. ^common-armor-varieties-field-emitter-panoply

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal implements that litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on some desolate lost world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at a comfortable distance is universally prized.

One Type A power cell is sufficient to recharge an energy weapon's magazine. For simplicity during play, ammunition calibers aren't tracked; a bullet is a bullet when it comes to feeding your favorite gun.

Weapons are listed with their normal and maximum range in meters. Attacks beyond normal range take a -2 penalty to hit rolls.

## Burst Mode

Some weaponry can fire in ***burst mode***, allowing the wielder to fire three rounds of ammunition for a +2 bonus to hit and damage against the target. For projectile weapons, this means firing actual bullets, while energy weapons spread the beam or run the circuits hot to project additional power. Dumping more ammunition than this at once is generally impractical; energy weapons would melt down and projectile launchers would buck uncontrollably. True suppressive fire is usually only possible with Heavy weapons. ^ranged-weapons-burst-mode

## Projectile Weaponry

Projectile weapons are by far the most common ranged weapons in human use. Even comparatively primitive worlds can fabricate and maintain such weaponry, and the damage a flying chunk of hot lead can do is often worse than what a clean burst of laser fire might produce. Almost any world of TL2 or higher can provide projectile ammunition. Most sophisticated modern ammunition works even in vacuum conditions.

- ***Bows*** are uncommon weapons in the far future, though some lostworlder barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated “conversion bows” use special materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into a force field “glazing” around the arrow, improving penetration. Bows can be reloaded with a Move action, or faster if the *Gunslinger* focus is applied. ^projectile-weapons-bows

- ***Grenade*** users always roll to attack AC 10. On a miss, the grenade lands 1d10 meters away from the target in a random direction. Hit or miss, the grenade then explodes for 2d6 damage to all targets within 5 meters. Victims are allowed an Evasion save for half damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each point of AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with the Exert skill instead of Shoot, if desired. ^projectile-weapons-grenade

- ***Crude pistols*** and ***muskets*** represent the rawest and most primitive forms of gunpowder weaponry, usually makeshift weapons improvised by criminals or the desperate. Reloading a crude pistol or a musket requires two rounds instead of one. ^projectile-weapons-crude-pistols

- ***Revolvers*** are quite popular on frontier worlds, as the weapons are extremely reliable and can be repaired and manufactured even by primitive metallurgists. Some revolver variants are specially built to handle atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons. ^projectile-weapons-revolvers

- ***Rifles*** are the mainstays of most TL2 armies and hunters, thanks to their superior range and power. ^projectile-weapons-rifles

- ***Shotguns*** are cheaper and more easily manufactured than rifles, and are popular weapons for home defense on the frontier. The statistics given are for shot ammunition. Slug rounds do 2d6 damage and have ranges of 50/75 meters. ^projectile-weapons-shotguns

- ***Semi-automatic pistols*** trade some of the reliability of the revolver for a larger magazine size. They tend to be the favorite sidearm for locals on planets that lack the harsh conditions or uncertain maintenance opportunities of a frontier world. ^projectile-weapons-semi-automatic-pistols

- ***Submachine guns*** take pistol ammunition but fire it at a high rate of speed. These weapons can fire in burst mode. ^projectile-weapons-submachine-guns

- ***Combat rifles*** are favored by the militaries of tech level 3 worlds, trading some of the often-unnecessary range and penetration of a conventional rifle for a larger ammunition capacity and burst fire capabilities. On more strait-laced worlds such military weaponry is often illegal for civilians to possess. ^projectile-weapons-combat-rifles

- ***Combat shotguns*** are more complicated and temperamental versions of conventional shotguns. These weapons have substantially larger ammunition capacity and are capable of firing in burst mode. Combat shotguns can fire slug rounds just as normal shotguns. ^projectile-weapons-combat-shotguns

- ***Sniper rifles*** are designed to be exceptionally effective at dropping unsuspecting targets at long range. Aside from the additional effective range of a sniper rifle, any target it mortally wounds via an execution attack will die instantly, with no chance for stabilization. The execution attack must qualify according to the terms here. If the rifle is used outside of such conditions, it has no special qualities. ^projectile-weapons-sniper-rifles

- ***Void carbines*** are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have essentially no recoil. Their rounds cannot penetrate ordinary ship equipment plating. ^projectile-weapons-void-carbines

- ***Mag weaponry*** involves the magnetic acceleration of metal flechettes, while ***spike throwers*** are the shotgun equivalents of these weapons. Mag ammunition is packaged with integral power supplies, so no additional power cells are necessary to fire these weapons. ^projectile-weapons-mag-weaponry

## Energy Weaponry

While the heavy metal slugs and flechettes thrown by projectile weaponry tend to be more damaging, the lack of recoil for non-Heavy energy weapons makes them more accurate, granting them a +1 bonus to hit rolls.

Energy weapons are very popular on more advanced worlds, as a soldier can carry far more ammunition in the form of energy cells than they can carry bullets. Range and accuracy are often superior, though the infrastructure necessary for maintenance and repair of these weapons is substantially higher.

Pistol-sized energy weapons count as one item of encumbrance, while rifles, thunder guns, plasma projectors, and distortion cannons count as two items.

- ***Laser pistols*** and ***laser rifles*** are the most common type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light. The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a -4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half. ^energy-weapons-laser-pistols

- ***Thermal pistols*** and their larger, two-handed ***plasma projector*** cousins replace the beam of a laser with a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than a laser beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in operation. ^energy-weapons-thermal-pistols

- ***Shear rifles*** are the product of a relatively few functioning pretech manufactories. These weapons use miniaturized grav projectors to create dangerous repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart along perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles are completely silent in operation. ^energy-weapons-shear-rifles

- ***Thunder guns*** are named for the basso vibrations caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid, randomized disruptions in a target that increase the chance of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage always applies to inanimate targets. ^energy-weapons-thunder-guns

- ***Distortion cannons*** are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream. These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided the wielder can see a target within range or accurately fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon can ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the gun and its target. ^energy-weapons-distortion-cannons

## Melee Weapons

Despite the relentless march of science, melee weapons are still useful adjuncts on the field of battle. They are silent, cheap, often easily concealed, and much more reliably murderous than firearms or laser weaponry. It's easy to miss a moving target in the adrenaline-fueled chaos of a firefight. It's much harder to go astray with a monoblade knife in your fist.

## Types of Common Weapons

Rather than enumerate every possible type of sharp object and blunt implement that has been used for death-dealing amid the scattered stars, melee weapons are divided into three classes.

- ***Small weapons*** are small one-handed implements no larger than a baton or knife. These weapons are easily concealed in normal clothing, and can even be kept readied up sleeves or in tailored pockets. Many can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters. ^common-melee-weapons-type-small

- ***Medium weapons*** are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other obvious implements of war. While they can't be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they're also more damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they're somewhat less nimble when the wielder needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters. ^common-melee-weapons-type-medium

- ***Large weapons*** are two-handed implements of bodily ruin such as claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count as two encumbrance items. ^common-melee-weapons-type-large

Aside from their type, weapons are counted as ***primitive*** or ***advanced***. A primitive weapon is simply one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech augmentations. An advanced one has been given a monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a chainsaw blade, or some other TL4 touch. Primitive weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered armor, while advanced weapons can ignore primitive plate and hide protections. ^common-melee-weapons-primitive-advanced

## Other Melee Weapons

- ***Stun batons*** are common law enforcement tools. The damage they do can drop a target to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points), but will not kill them, the victim awakening in ten minutes with one hit point. Stun batons trickle-charge from normal movement and will not run out of electrical energy under normal use conditions. ^other-melee-weapons-stun-batons

- ***Suit rippers*** are rods with fractal cutting surfaces designed to cripple vacc suit auto-repair routines. Every hit with a suit ripper counts as a suit tear on a vacc suit-wearing enemy. Unsurprisingly, these weapons are strictly illegal in space environments. ^other-melee-weapons-suit-rippers

- ***Unarmed attacks*** reflect ordinary kicks and punches. Unarmed attacks always add the attacker's Punch skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons. Kinesis wraps, spiked knuckles, and other small fist weapons may be treated as small advanced or primitive weapons that use the Punch skill and add the skill level to their rolled damage, but not to Shock. Such weapons do not augment a hero with the *Unarmed Combatant* focus. ^other-melee-weapons-unarmed

## Shock

Many [melee weapons](#melee%20weapons) have a ***Shock*** trait representing the danger they pose to an ill-armored opponent. Shock damage represents the inevitable cuts, bruises, exhaustion, and terror of close combat.

Shock damage is only inflicted on a melee target if the hit roll *fails*, and it only applies if the target has an AC equal or less than that listed for the Shock.

Shock damage always includes the wielder's attribute modifier and any bonus damage granted by weapon mods, foci, advanced tech, or other damage bonuses. An actual hit with a weapon never does less damage than Shock would otherwise inflict; if the user somehow rolls less damage, use the Shock damage instead.

Thus, if you had a Strength score of 14 and were swinging an oversized alien battle axe at a target with AC 13, you would inflict 3 points of damage on a miss; 2 from the weapon's Shock, plus 1 from your Strength modifier. If you hit, you'd do at least 3 points.

### Table - Melee Weapons

| Weapon                  |  Dmg.  | Shock          | Attribute | Cost | Enc. | TL  |
| ----------------------- |:------:| -------------- | --------- | ----:|:----:|:---:|

## Heavy Weapons

Some weapons are simply too big to be comfortably used without a tripod, fixed support, or vehicle mounting. Others require specialized training in the use of heavy munitions. The weapons listed here all use the Shoot skill to determine hit bonuses, and unless otherwise noted, all require some sort of support for firing.

Energy weapons use Type B power cells. Rocket launchers and hydra arrays use missiles as given on the gear tables, while heavy machine guns and wheatcutter belts consume large amounts of standard ammunition.

Some heavy guns can be fired to ***suppress***. Double the usual ammunition is fired in one round, and every target in front of the weapon that is not under hard cover is automatically hit for half normal damage. A successful Evasion saving throw eliminates this damage. ^heavy-weapons-suppressing-fire

When firing at TL4 military vehicles such as gravtanks, mechs, or starship armor, most TL3 Heavy weapons don't count as Heavy for armor-penetrating purposes. Demo charges and explosives do, however.

- ***Heavy machine guns*** represent a large family of air- or water-cooled projectile weapons that are usually fed with belts of linked ammunition. HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced firing position for effective results. An HMG magazine contains enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing, but each round of firing eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition. ^heavy-weapons-heavy-machine-guns

- ***Rocket launchers*** cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are usually equipped with basic tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket launchers take a -4 hit penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most Heavy weapons, rocket launchers can be shoulder-fired without a prepared emplacement to support them. ^heavy-weapons-rocket-launchers

- ***Demo Charges*** are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists and adventurers the world over. The usual variety can be detonated by radio signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their damage on any objects within twenty meters, with an Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save for none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest. ^heavy-weapons-demo-charges

- ***Railguns*** are simply scaled-up versions of personal mag rifles. They accelerate large metallic slugs along the weapon's barrel, creating a steady spray of hypervelocity rounds. Ammunition sufficient for one round of firing costs 50 credits. ^heavy-weapons-railguns

- ***Anti-vehicle lasers*** are less useful against soft targets, but excel at penetrating vehicle armor. Against vehicles and other hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice and the better result is used. ^heavy-weapons-anti-vehicle-lasers

- ***Hydra arrays*** sequence a number of missile launchers to fire at once. The gunner designates up to three targets and can then make three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the best result. A volley from the array costs 150 credits. ^heavy-weapons-hydra-arrays

- ***Wheatcutter belts*** are one of several different antipersonnel measures often installed on gravtanks and other fighting vehicles. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side of the vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle's Armor like other Heavy weapons do. Reloading a wheatcutter belt costs 200 credits per round. ^heavy-weapons-wheatcutter-belts

- ***Vortex cannons*** use controlled gravitic shear planes to cause a target to simply fall apart into component fragments. The cannons are silent in operation, but so heavy and complex that they can only be mounted on gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting vehicles. ^heavy-weapons-vortex-canons

## General Equipment

Most of the equipment listed here is available on any TL4 world. Even the TL5 items are among the simpler and more ubiquitous pretech relics and could likely be acquired on a sufficiently prosperous world with a good market in Mandate tech. Buying any TL5 equipment on the open market is subject to GM approval, however, and many worlds are flatly ban private ownership of ancient Mandate technology.

Some encumbrance entries are marked with an asterisk. Such items have no significant encumbrance and dozens can be carried without hindrance.

Other entries are marked with a hashmark. These objects can be conveniently packed together in a smaller, more portable package. Three such objects can be packed together as a single encumbrance item. For ammunition, one loaded magazine counts as one item. Breaking open such a package to get at the contents takes a Main Action, however, before they can be Readied with another Main Action.

## Ammo and Power

The finest product of a 33rd-century armory is useless if it lacks the bullets or power cells to feed it. For ease of play, ammunition can be used interchangeably with any projectile weapon. Power cells are designed along Mandate-era lines that allow for easy compatibility among devices from different worlds.

- ***Ammunition:*** A few worlds are too primitive or too resource-poor to manufacture ammunition, but the vast majority of worlds provide cartridges in almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most local gunsmiths can load ammunition to any specification required by a buyer. ^ammo-and-power-ammunition

- ***Ammunition, missile:*** Some characters might have reason to pack along a man-portable rocket launcher, or have one mounted on their favorite gravcar. Heavy weapons and their ammunition are usually outlawed for civilians on most worlds, but this price is for locales where missiles can be bought. ^ammo-and-power-ammunition-missle

- ***Power cells:*** One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for personal equipment, and the larger type B cells for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for the cells is substantially different, and they cannot be exchanged or recharge each other without a trained tech's modifications or a converter unit. Power cells can be recharged off a ship's power plant or other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell or 24 hours for a type B cell. ^ammo-and-power-power-cells

- ***Solar recharger:*** This recharger unfolds into a 2 meter by 2 meter square field of solar cells. Granted a primary star of roughly Earth-like intensity, it can recharge one type A power cell per day. ^ammo-and-power-solar-recharger

- ***Telekinetic generator:*** While this device assumes the presence of a trained telekinetic, it isn't strictly psitech, as its operation is quite simple. A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an attached power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an emergency, a character with at least Strength 10 can operate the generator manually, though they need to succeed on a difficulty 8 Con/Exert skill check in order to keep up the pace for an hour. Failure means that the character must rest for at least an hour before trying again. The generator can charge one type A power cell at a time. ^ammo-and-power-telekinetic-generator

## Communications

Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible with any standard compad. Some planets are less technologically gifted, however, or have local conditions that preclude easy wireless communication. Other times, the PCs have reason to avoid leaving call logs that might come back to haunt them.

- ***Comm server:*** A powerful base unit for providing communications without comsats. The server provides service between up to three dozen compads within 300 kilometers of the unit. Server usage can be locked to specific compads, and all transmissions are heavily encrypted. A comm server can function for several months on a type B cell. ^communications-comm-server

- ***Compad:*** One of a host of different hand-held portable communications devices. Most TL4 worlds have global comm coverage, but primitive worlds render these devices useless without a nearby comm server to provide connectivity. ^communications-compad

- ***Field radio:*** On worlds too primitive to have a comm grid, adventurers often fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A single type A cell powers them for months of use. Urban or rugged terrain limits their range to about two kilometers, while flat plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers. Someone with at least Program-0 skill can use the radio's shortwave functionality to communicate with a prepared target at continental distances if given ten minutes for tuning. ^communications-field-radio

- ***Translator torc:*** Each translator torc is keyed for two languages, and will automatically translate what it hears in one into speech in the other. The translations are eccentric in many cases, and there is always a several-second delay between each statement and its translation. Any attempts to exert social skills or Charisma through a translator torc suffer a -2 skill check penalty. The torc is powered by one type A power cell, which lasts for one week of regular use. ^communications-translator-torc

## Computing Gear

Computing devices are ubiquitous on most TL4 worlds, though not all of them have the kind of planetary network known on 21st century Terra. Would-be hackers often find it necessary to take a very personal hand in breaching site security.

- ***Black slab:*** While a “black slab” appears to be a normal dataslab to casual examination, these devices are packed with intrusion-optimization hardware and integral line tapping tools. They function as a metatool for purposes of accessing data lines and grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made with them. They are also quite illegal on most worlds, available only from black market dealers and private sales from hackers. ^computing-gear-black-slab

- ***Data phase tap:*** This handheld device is normally illegal outside the possession of licensed data line repair technicians. The tap can detect data lines within five meters through up to ten centimeters of ordinary walls, and can generate an energy manipulation field that allows tapping that data line for hacking purposes without physically damaging the wall. ^computing-gear-data-phase-tap

- ***Data protocol:*** Not so much a device as a collection of standard manuals on a world's particular data formats and security methodologies. The price listed here are for black-market manuals on worlds where this information is rigidly restricted. On less paranoid planets, the equivalent information can be acquired for free. ^computing-gear-data-protocol

- ***Dataslab:*** A palm-sized computing device that can unfold into a thin slab roughly one-third of a meter on a side. It can perform all the functions of a compad or handheld computer and can communicate wirelessly with nearby devices. ^computing-gear-dataslab

- ***Line shunt:*** These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift color to blend with its surroundings. One or more line shunts must be applied at specific locations within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not need to be directly in contact with a data line but only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are single-use, and keep functioning until removed. ^computing-gear-line-shunt

- ***Remote link unit:*** These data broadcast link units have been preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and sophisticated data progression algorithms. Two of these links can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote data storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a -2 penalty to any attempts to hack through it. Professional-grade security systems often have means to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit. ^computing-gear-remote-link-unit

- ***Stiletto charge:*** These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion charges were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily overcome primitive colonial data security measures. Each charge is a small interface plug the size of a human thumb. When used as part of a hack against a TL4 system, it causes the skill check to automatically succeed regardless of the difficulty. Without line shunts, however, the duration of the hack is still no more than the usual 1d4 rounds plus the hacker's Program skill. These devices are single-use, and are prized so highly that they are almost always unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the right people and the looting of Mandate remnants are the only normal ways to acquire these devices. ^computing-gear-stiletto-charge

- ***Storage unit:*** While conventional dataslabs have ample space to hold any reasonable amount of data, sometimes a party needs to store or acquire a truly huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm, capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single storage unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that has been carefully compressed and optimized for it. If the user is simply ripping a database off a network and stuffing it into the unit, it can absorb up to a small corporation's complete files. ^computing-gear-storage-unit

- ***Tightbeam link unit:*** Much like a remote link unit, a tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via line-of-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit, there's almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this link, but it requires that the infiltrators get a clear line of sight between the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed for skyward aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is unavailable, but indoor use is impossible. ^computing-gear-tightbeam-link-unit


## Foreign Protocols

> Most surviving human worlds continue to use a basic Mandate-derived communications protocol that ensures a minimal level of compatibility between hardware from different worlds. While the performance may not be ideal, tech purchased on one world should still be able to interface with the local tech on a different planet.
>
> Even so, a few worlds of a more xenophobic or isolated nature intentionally abandon this standard protocol in favor of their own. PC hardware on these worlds will not communicate with the local grid unless a PC with Program or Fix skills has a chance to reset the protocols to something compatible with local conditions. Such work usually takes at least a day to adjust all the gear the group might possess.

## Pharmaceuticals

Modern pharmaceuticals are usually applied as “stims”; small capsules that are pressed against the target's skin for application. While a wide variety of common over-the-counter stims are available, the ones listed below are some particularly likely to be useful to adventurers. Many medical stims require a minimum level in the Heal skill to successfully apply them, while others add System Strain to the target as described here. If a subject's System Strain is too high already, the stim has no positive effect. Some of the combat stims below are usually illegal for civilian possession, but street sources are available at the prices given.

Modern vacc suits and powered armor have medical ports that allow for applying stims and other medical treatment without removing the suit.

- ***Bezoar (Heal-1):*** A complex antibiotic cocktail, Bezoar is an effective default treatment for a wide variety of infectious diseases. When applied to a sufferer, roll 1d6; on a 1, this victim cannot be helped by Bezoar, while otherwise the affliction is cured within 24 hours. Each application of Bezoar adds 1 System Strain to the target, and it cannot cure cancers, bioweapons, or congenital diseases. ^pharmaceuticals-bezoar

- ***Brainwave (Heal-2):*** This psitech drug requires advanced TL5 facilities to compound, and the few remaining doses from pre-Silence periods are rarely available on the open market. Application of Brainwave gives a psychic 2 extra maximum Effort for one hour. At the end of that hour, they suffer 4 points of System Strain. If their Strain is maximized by this, they go unconscious for one hour. Only one dose can be active at a time. ^pharmaceuticals-brainwave

- ***Hush (Heal-0):*** An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer, Hush leaves the subject awake and responsive to simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight or communicate while affected by Hush, but will walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects. ^pharmaceuticals-hush

- ***Lift (Heal-0):*** A Lift stim augments and amplifies the body's natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user's Heal skill in [hit points](#^character-hit-points) after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them, though application to a stabilized target will get them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each additional application of Lift to a target the same day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1. ^pharmaceuticals-lift

- ***Pretech Cosmetic (None):*** Before the Silence stims existed for a host of cosmetic, hygiene, and health purposes. While these effects are trivial, the basic pretech stim substrate also works to heal 1d6 lost [hit points](#^character-hit-points) in the user at a cost of 1 System Strain. ^pharmaceuticals-pretech-cosmetic

- ***Psych (None):*** A military drug duplicated in rougher form by many street chemists, Psych fills the user with an intense sense of confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their judgment regarding danger. A person affected by Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the user, and is highly psychologically addictive. ^pharmaceuticals-psych

- ***Reverie (Heal-1):*** This very dangerous combat drug completely subdues the subject's fear centers and adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they can make Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon. The target's Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target. ^pharmaceuticals-reverie

- ***Squeal (Heal-1):*** This “truth serum” is unreliable but still one of the best available options for field interrogations. The subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards they will be unable to avoid answering questions about facts known to them; they will be unable to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a judgment, but they will answer specific questions about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on a success, they can simply refuse to speak about one particular topic of their choice. Targets pass out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are immune to it for a week thereafter. ^pharmaceuticals-squeal

- ***Tsunami (Heal-1):*** An emergency combat stim used to juice certain expendable soldiers before an assault, Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short effect duration and difficult application limits its wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score of 12, 10 extra [hit points](#^character-hit-points) for ten minutes and a +2 bonus on all hit rolls. At the end of the duration, they immediately lose those 10 [hit points](#^character-hit-points), which may leave them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to the target. ^pharmaceuticals-tsunami

### Tools and Medical Gear

While a skilled technician or expert physician can make do with improvised tools scrounged from their surroundings, most adventurers prefer to be better-equipped to face unavoidable perils. Most of these tools and medical supplies are available on any TL4 world, though pretech toolkits usually require excellent personal contacts to obtain.

- ***Bioscanner:*** While an untrained user can use this tool to discern internal bleeding, gross physical distress, or toxins in a plant or animal, it requires Heal-0 skill to use this tool to its fullest. Such operators can use the bioscanner for a full spectrum of diagnosis and DNA sequencing achievable in minutes. One type A power cell will power it for up to twenty-four hours of regular usage. ^tools-and-medical-gear-bioscanner

- ***Lazarus patch:*** A vital tool for adventurers, the lazarus patch is a heavy compress laced with antibiotics, coagulants, system stabilizers, plasma, and a one-shot diagnostic suite. If the patch is applied to a character that has fallen to 0 [hit points](#^character-hit-points), the user can make an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check against difficulty 6 to stabilize the subject. The more time between injury and application, the less chance the patch has to work. Each round after the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the skill check. The patch is no use after six rounds. If the medic fails the first skill check, they can keep trying the check once per round until the victim is revived or time runs out. ^tools-and-medical-gear-lazarus-patch

  Lazarus patches are no use on victims that have died of disease, poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy weapons or similar trauma. Only one patch can be applied to a victim. Revived victims are critically wounded until sufficient medical help has been tendered; see the Systems chapter for details.

- ***Medkit:*** Containing a broad supply of pharmaceuticals, spray bandages, glue sutures, and a succinct handbook of injury care, the medkit is designed for handling sudden and drastic injuries. It also contains all the necessary tools for providing long-term recuperative care for critically injured characters. After each day of granting long-term recuperative care, roll 2d6 per patient treated; on a 12, the kit has run out of some vital pharmaceutical and has become useless. ^tools-and-medical-gear-medkit

- ***Metatool:*** This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small, useful tools designed to handle the widest possible range of technical needs. While a metatool is too limited to handle major jobs, it is usually sufficient to manage jury-rigged repairs and temporary fixes until the tech has time to apply a larger wrench to the problem. ^tools-and-medical-gear-metatool

- ***Spare parts:*** This is a general category for a number of small TL4 components and repair materials. While a simple toolkit or metatool is often enough to fix a damaged object, severely broken devices may need replacement parts. Rather than keep a catalog of bits and pieces, a technician can simply bring along one or more units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM decides that a repair effort requires more than existing salvage can support. A unit of spare parts can also be used to jury-rig some basic, uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such bodged devices rarely last longer than one scene. ^tools-and-medical-gear-spare-parts

- ***Tailored Antiallergens:*** A dose of tailored antiallergens can be used to render a local world's organics largely edible by humans and its atmosphere breathable without severe allergic reactions. While many worlds have been seeded with Terran life forms or have produced organics that are edible by humans, others are toxic without the appropriate chemical augmentation. A dose of these antiallergens lasts for twenty-four hours. ^tools-and-medical-gear-tailored-antiallergens

- ***Toolkits:*** Containing a wide range of necessary tools for a particular skill set, toolkits can handle almost any job that doesn't require a full-scale shop or lab. A standard postech toolkit can handle electronics, small welding jobs, and basic repair on ordinary TL4 goods. More sophisticated pretech tools are necessary for working on advanced TL5 artifacts, and the tools themselves are very rare and difficult to obtain. ^tools-and-medical-gear-toolkits

## Building New Tech

> In a science-fiction game, it's often difficult to figure out the limits of ad-hoc tech. When the limits of technology often seem to be based on genre rather than physics it can be tough to make the call.
>
> Most of the time, it's simply not practical for a technician to devise dramatic new tech without the use of a full-scale research facility.
>
> Even so, sometimes a PC will ask to build something that creates a particular effect that seems in line with other gear of a similar tech level. A hologram-emitting “grenade”, a jury-rigged set of infrared goggles, an explosive that detonates if background radiation drops below a certain level&hellip; these things match known TL4 tech.
>
> In these cases, the GM should set a plausible-seeming price in credits or spare part units, assign a time ranging from fifteen minutes to a month based on the complexity of the tech, and roll a secret Int/Fix check against a difficulty from 8 to 12. When the tech is actually used, the skill check determines whether it functions or not.
>
> Most such jury-rigged tech works only once, being too fragile or quirky to last more than a scene. Repeated refinement and testing may allow for a more lasting piece of equipment.

## Field Equipment

When venturing into the trackless void every adventurer is going to need the right hardware to survive the experience. The field equipment in this section includes some of the more common technology favored by explorers and fearless investigators of alien worlds. The TL5 equipment listed here can usually be found for sale on populous worlds with an active commerce in pretech relics, but smaller or more backwards worlds may not have any of it available.

- ***Atmofilter:*** This face mask can filter out most atmospheric toxins. Attaching a standard vacc suit oxygen bottle to a belt-mounted feed will also supply a breathable atmosphere for up to six hours. ^field-equipment-atmofilter

- ***Backpack:*** TL4 versions of this item are effectively without encumbrance, albeit they cost 50 credits. A worn backpack counts as a readied item, though objects stowed inside it still require the usual round to dig free. Characters without backpacks or similar carrying devices might have difficulty justifying the hauling of large amounts of gear. ^field-equipment-backpack

- ***Binoculars:*** Standard 7x50 binoculars. TL4 versions are available that have integral low-light optics and up to 25x150 power. TL 4 binocs cost 200 credits and require a type A power cell for up to a week of regular usage. ^field-equipment-binoculars

- ***Climbing harness:*** A collection of straps, ropes, pitons, and other climbing aids that grant a +1 bonus on any Exert climbing skill test. Using a climbing harness is noisy, and any Sneak skill checks while climbing with one suffer a -2 penalty. ^field-equipment-climbing-harness

- ***Glowbug:*** A palm-sized disc that can adhere to any non-porous surface. When turned on, it emits a white light, illuminating everything within ten meters for twenty-four hours. A hundred glowbugs can be recharged off a single type A cell. ^field-equipment-glowbug

- ***Grapnel launcher:*** This launcher fires a rope up to forty meters. The rope can bear up to a metric ton of weight, though extremely heavy weights or a precarious hit can cause the grapnel to pull free. A Type A power cell fuels six shots from a launcher. ^field-equipment-grapnel-launcher

- ***Grav chute:*** When this cylinder is strapped to a person or object and activated, it smoothly modulates falling speeds for up to 1000 meters. The chute can safely slow up to 300 kilos of weight. TL5 versions can operate from orbital heights and cost 1,000 credits, where they can be found at all. Both versions burn out after one use. ^field-equipment-grav-chute

- ***Grav harness:*** This advanced gravitic harness allows clumsy flight at a rate of 20 meters per round as a Main Action. It requires a Type B power cell to fuel it, and the miniaturized electronics are rapacious, consuming the cell in five minutes of operation. It can lift up to 200 kilos. ^field-equipment-grav-harness

- ***Instapanel:*** In its compressed form, an instapanel is a two-kilo cube of ceraplast five centimeters on a side. When a type A power cell is inserted in the cube's side, it immediately expands to an opaque, waterproof ceraplast sheet 2 meters on each side and a centimeter thick. Five minutes later the ceraplast hardens into a tough, rigid shape, but until then it can be folded or bent by hand. Instapanels can be bonded to one another with a metatool or a toolkit. Breaking an instapanel requires inflicting at least twelve points of damage on it. ^field-equipment-instapanel

- ***Low-light goggles:*** These goggles provide a monochrome but serviceable view out to the wearer's normal visual distance, provided that there is any illumination available at all. A type A power cell will operate these goggles for a week. ^field-equipment-low-light-goggles

- ***Navcomp:*** A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers, astronomic charts, and gyroscopes packed into a flat, one-kilo case. A character with a navcomp will never get lost on worlds with GPS satellites. They can also make a crude but serviceable automatic map of all buildings or landscapes they travel through. Other terrestrial navigation skill checks are made at a +1 bonus. ^field-equipment-navcomp

- ***Portabox:*** A small cube of ceraplast attached to an electronic keycard. When a type A power cell is inserted, the portabox immediately unfolds into a rigid locker with 1.5 x 1 x 1 meter dimensions. The portabox is air-tight and has a simple electronic lock which can only be opened with the keycard or a successful difficulty 8 Sneak or Fix skill check. Failing the check will cause the lock to short-circuit and seal the box until it can be cut open with a metatool or broken open with twenty points of damage. ^field-equipment-portabox

- ***Pressure tent:*** This tent maintains a breathable atmosphere, tolerable temperature and serviceable sleeping quarters for up to five very friendly occupants. Advanced filtration and cracking tech allows a single standard vacc suit oxygen tank to provide breathable air for the occupants for up to 24 hours. The tent requires a type A power cell for each day in which this filter is employed. ^field-equipment-pressure-tent

- ***Rations:*** Dried or otherwise preserved foodstuffs sufficient for one day. If water is not otherwise available, add another item's worth of encumbrance for the water necessary for a person's daily needs. ^field-equipment-rations

- ***Rope:*** Light and sturdy. A metatool can be used to cut and join the synthetics used in TL4 rope, which counts as one encumbrance item per 40 meters and costs 40 credits. ^field-equipment-rope

- ***Scout report:*** A collation of survey scans and merchant reports on a particular lost world or isolated colony. Scouting reports are available for all but the most unknown worlds and provide maps, basic information, and note any critical cultural taboos. ^field-equipment-scout-report

- ***Survey scanner:*** A multipurpose scanner that can take atmospheric and gravitic readings, provide basic chemical analysis of samples of up to one cubic centimeter in size, and record up to two hundred hours of video information or ten times that amount of audio. Know skill checks are necessary for any but the most basic analysis. ^field-equipment-survey-scanner

- ***Survival kit:*** A standard belt-worn kit with fire lighter, water filter, three thermal flares, knife, thermal blanket, a brightly-colored 3 x 3 meter waterproof tarp, a glowbug, and a radio beacon that can transmit a distress signal up to fifty kilometers for one month on the included type A power cell. Survival kits sold on a particular world will usually also include a small booklet on specific dangers or edible organics. Possession of a survival kit grants a +1 to all relevant Survive skill checks, assuming its contents are helpful on a given planet. Survival kits are well-organized, and count as only one item for encumbrance purposes. ^field-equipment-survival-kit

- ***Telescoping pole:*** Retracting to a 30-centimeter baton, this pole extends and locks into a 3.048-meter extension that can bear as much as a thousand kilograms of weight or serve as a makeshift club. ^field-equipment-telescoping-pole

- ***Thermal flare:*** If triggered in one mode, the flare burns with a bright white light for two hours, illuminating up to twenty meters around the holder. If the guidance fins are extended first, the flare launches up to 200 meters and explodes in a bright white flash. A launched flare does 1d6 damage to anyone it hits, though the clumsy flight gives a -4 penalty on any attempts to hit something with it. ^field-equipment-thermal-flare

- ***Trade goods:*** Glowbugs, ceramic fire lighters, antibiotics, ceraplast tools, and the other fruits of a TL4 civilization that might be valuable on more primitive worlds. A kilo of trade goods can usually be traded for at least a hundred credits worth of local products on more primitive worlds that are not well-served by interstellar merchants. The profit margin shrinks rapidly as interstellar trade becomes more common, and there is always the difficulty of finding local products that are actually worth a merchant's journey. ^field-equipment-trade-goods

- ***Trade metals:*** The fruit of common TL4 asteroid mining, trade metals include gold, platinum, artificial gemstones, and other substances precious on many lost worlds and trivially valuable on spacefaring ones. A kilo worth of trade metals can be exchanged for as much as a thousand credits worth of local products on metal-poor worlds isolated from interstellar trade. Markets flood rapidly, however, and it usually doesn't take more than a few merchant trips to persuade the locals to demand trade goods or credits. ^field-equipment-trade-metals

## Local Brands

> The equipment described in this section matches standard TL4 hardware from the average modern space-faring world. A PC who buys a generic vacc suit can expect it to work the way it's listed here.
>
> Not all worlds have identical tech, however, even if they share a tech level. Planets with particular natural hazards or technological focuses often have significantly better tech for dealing with these things than their neighbors, while worlds that lack vital resources or industrial infrastructure might have considerably worse gear.
>
> As the GM, don't hesitate to brew up local tech that can be used as a reward for PCs or a special buying opportunity. The gear might grant skill bonuses, function longer, do more damage, have an AC bonus, or offer some other perk. Such unique hardware can add flavor to a world's tech.

- ***Vacc fresher:*** This three-kilo tube filters and compresses atmosphere to refill vacc suit oxygen tanks. It can extract oxygen from any atmosphere which contains it, even in the form of carbon dioxide. Refilling a standard vacc suit tank requires ten minutes of operation and consumes one type A power cell. Most vacc freshers are also equipped with an emergency hand crank power source, though it requires at least two hours of cranking. ^field-equipment-vacc-fresher

- ***Vacc suit:*** The standard TL4 vacc suit is designed to allow the wearer to survive in both hard vacuum and on most inhospitable planetary surfaces. The suit protects against ordinary levels of cosmic radiation and provides a temperature-controlled atmosphere. Vacc suits are equipped with radios that have a ten-kilometer range. A vacc suit oxygen tank weighs 1 encumbrance, included with the weight of the suit, and functions for six hours. ^field-equipment-vacc-suit

  Vacc suits are cumbersome, and apply a -2 penalty to all hit rolls and skill checks that require movement. Those with at least a month of zero-gee experience can ignore this penalty. No armor can be worn with a vacc suit, though the suit itself grants AC 13 to its wearers. A vacc suit requires one type A power cell for each twelve hours of operation.

  Vacc suits have a self-healing exterior that can seal the puncture wounds caused by bullets, arrows, or energy beams, but a strike from an edged weapon can overwhelm the repair system. If a character with 10 or fewer [hit points](#^character-hit-points) is struck by an edged weapon, there is a 50% chance the suit is torn. Suits are equipped with emergency repair patches, but it requires a Main Action to apply one. Exposure to vacuum is described here.

- ***Vacc skin:*** A more advanced TL5 version of the vacc suit, this skin-tight suit can be worn as a readied item in conjunction with armor, though it grants no Armor Class bonus itself. It requires no oxygen tank, automatically cracking and recycling the wearer's respiration, and can even recycle the wearer's bodily waste into drinkable water if necessary. Vacc skins apply no penalty to hit rolls or skill checks for wearers. It suffers tears in the same way as a normal vacc suit, and requires a type A power cell for each 24 hours of operation. ^field-equipment-vacc-skin

## Lifestyles, Employees, and Services

Adventurers who spend much time in a place are likely to need to buy food, shelter, and the usual trifles of daily living. Rather than itemize each expense, a PC can simply spend an fixed amount for each day they spend living outside of a ship's crew, barracks, or other arranged living situation.

- ***Slum*** lifestyles reflect bare minimums for survival, with scanty food, a corner in a squat somewhere, and little else. ^lifestyle-slum

- ***Poor*** lifestyles involve barracks-like quarters, public transport, and small and infrequent luxuries. ^lifestyle-poor

- ***Common*** lifestyles usually allow for a private urban apartment or rural home, a rented personal vehicle, a respectable wardrobe, and regular small indulgences. ^lifestyle-common

- ***Good*** lifestyles permit a private urban townhouse or similar dwelling, a spacious rural home, a better grade of personal vehicle, and the ability to indulge in minor expenses such as restaurants or clubs without concern. ^lifestyle-good

- ***Elite*** lifestyles allow for entire floors of luxury buildings or rented rural estates, drivers and on-call gravflyers, personal staff, and similar perks. ^lifestyle-elite

- ***Peerless*** lifestyles are similar to that of pampered celebrities and oligarchs, with round-the-clock staff service, free entrance into the most exclusive locales, and the best of everything. ^lifestyle-peerless

Prices given here assume short-term rentals and contracts, plus the inevitable premium charged to outsiders in almost any society. Natives might be able to enjoy a given level of lifestyle for only half as much, but such savings usually rely on a local's connections.

### Table - Lifestyle Cost Per Day

| Lifestyle | Cost/day |
| --------- | --------:|
| Slum      |        5 |
| Poor      |       10 |
| Common    |       15 |
| Good      |       25 |
| Elite     |      200 |
| Peerless  |    1,000 |


 PCs will sometimes need to hire help, and GMs occasionally need to know what constitutes a “good wage” for a local NPC. The prices to the right reflect daily wages for NPCs with level-0, level-1, and level-2 skill ratings in their relevant professional skills. More talented employees cannot normally be obtained without special effort in finding and recruiting them.

Psychics are both rare and expensive to hire. Even if one can be found, they rarely charge less than 200 credits per day per psychic skill level to be employed.

Employees will carry out ordinary duties without demur, but will be no braver or more dedicated than their pay and connections would make them.

### Table - Employee Wages

| Employee        | Wage/day (level-0/1/2) |
| --------------- |:----------------------:|
| Artist          |        3/10/100        |

Adventurers often need to obtain certain services or concessions from the locals, and the list to the right provides prices for some of their more common needs.

Bribe prices often vary depending on a planet's general level of corruption, but the prices here are normal for most. Minor crimes usually involve anything that would only earn a fine or a few months in jail. Major crimes include most felonies and anything that would earn years in prison. Capital crimes are any that would get a culprit executed on the world. Particularly blatant or sensitive offenses might be impossible to solve with mere bribery, though the right “special favors” to the right officials might win a reprieve.

Forged identity papers include high-quality documentation with the appropriate false database entries. They're good enough to survive checkpoints and security stops, but they won't hold up to a serious check by a suspicious bureaucrat.

### Table - Cost of Services

| Service                           |       Cost |
| --------------------------------- | ----------:|
| Bribe, minor crime forgiveness    |         50 |

### Vehicles

Most modern TL4 worlds rely on electrically-powered gravitic vehicles. Whether in the ubiquitous gravcar, hovercycle, or high-altitude gravflyer, cleared roadways carry the traffic of countless worlds. On rougher worlds, the roads may not even be paved, instead relying on a gravitic vehicle's high clearance to avoid holes and rough debris.

Less sophisticated worlds are still reliant on internal-combustion engines. Many worlds have sufficient local resources to fabricate some kind of combustible fuel, but a few are so impoverished that they lack even this minimal resource. Such worlds must rely on muscle power for transport, either that of alien beasts or humble human porters.

### Vehicle Statistics and Combat

Vehicles are generally powered by type B power cells on TL4 worlds. More primitive planets are usually forced to use some form of biofuel unless they're fortunate enough to have a supply of fossil fuels. Vehicles require one cell or one refueling per six hours of operation, assuming they don't have convenient power access.

Vehicles are generally limited to reasonably flat, dry terrain. Grav vehicles such as hovercycles can ignore rough terrain and calm water, as can ATV explorers. Most grav vehicles can boost more than 10 meters above the ground or water; gravflyers are purpose-designed aircraft capable of hovering and VTOL.

- ***Speed*** is an abstract measure of the vehicle's speed and agility. When vehicles chase each other, the opposing vehicle's Speed should be applied as a penalty to Pilot skill checks to close or escape. Speed may also be used as a modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or trying to avoid a peril on the road. ^vehicle-speed

- ***Armor*** is subtracted from all weapon damage done to the vehicle. Armor does not apply to damage done by Heavy weaponry; such guns are often designed to take out vehicles. Gravtanks in particular are immune to anything short of TL4 Heavy weapons, while less sophisticated tanks are immune to anything below TL3 Heavy ordnance. ^vehicle-armor

  Actually hitting the vehicle is automatic if the vehicle is stationary and within 30 feet. Hitting a vehicle-sized target from beyond that range requires an attack against AC 10. If the target is moving, subtract its Speed from the hit roll, and if the attacker is in a moving vehicle as well, also subtract their Speed.

- ***Hit Points*** indicate the amount of damage a vehicle can take before it is destroyed. Speed is reduced by half when the vehicle is at half hit points, and flying vehicles must land at the first opportunity. A vehicle reduced to zero hit points forces all crew and passengers to make Physical saving throws. Failure means that the passenger takes the vehicle's maximum hit points in damage, while success reduces the damage by half. ^vehicle-hit-points

- ***Crew*** gives the maximum number of vehicle occupants. For the listed vehicles, only one crew member is actually necessary to drive or pilot the vehicle, though additional crew members may be required to fire. ^vehicle-crew

- ***Tonnage*** is the shipping weight of the vehicle for ship loading purposes. ^vehicle-tonnage

- ***Tech Level*** indicates the minimum tech level for constructing the vehicle. Vehicles can be built at higher tech levels for better performance, but most worlds prefer to simply build more advanced vehicles. ^vehicle-tech-level

### Vehicle Weaponry

Most vehicles larger than a motorcycle or hovercycle can mount some kind of integral weapon. Groundcars and gravcars can mount one weapon, while ATVs, helicopters, atmoflyers, and gravflyers can mount two. Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms, and can mount six.

### Table - Vehicles Chart

| Vehicle      |    Cost | Speed |  Armor  | HP  | Crew | Tonnage | TL  |
| ------------ | -------:|:-----:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:-------:|:---:|
| Motorcycle   |   1,000 |   1   |    4    | 10  |  1   |    1    |  3  |
| Groundcar    |   5,000 |   0   |    6    | 30  |  5   |   10    |  3  |
| Hovercycle   |   5,000 |   2   |    3    | 10  |  1   |    1    |  4  |

| Helicopter   |  25,000 |   3   |    6    | 20  |  6   |   50    |  3  |
| Atmoflyer    |  30,000 |   4   |    8    | 25  |  6   |   50    |  3  |
| Gravflyer    |  40,000 |   5   |    8    | 25  |  6   |   50    |  4  |
| Gravtank     | 200,000 |   2   | Special | 50  |  3   |   50    |  5  |


Heavy weapons take up more space than ordinary ranged weapons, and each such system takes up the space of two lesser guns.

Every weapon requires its own gunner, and all mounted weapons use Shoot as the firing skill, though the GM might allow Pilot to be used for a nose-mounted weapon aimed by the operator. Gravtanks are equipped with advanced targeting systems, and all of their weapons can be targeted and fired by one gunner.

### Types of Vehicles

Every world has its own brands of common vehicles, but the types below cover the more usual models. The prices given for each reflect a mid-range new vehicle sold to a PC with few local contacts. Natives who know the right people or are willing to buy used or “quirky” vehicles might be able to get one at half that price.

- ***Motorcycles*** can navigate urban terrain that would block larger vehicles, but more rural landscapes can prove more difficult. ***Hovercycles*** are the TL4 equivalent, capable of brief boosts of up to 10 meters above the ground and the easy navigation of all but thick forests or sheer slopes. ^vehicle-type-motorcycles

- ***Groundcars*** are the TL3 analogs of the vehicles commonly in use on 21st-century Earth, allowing for some minor variations in electronics and capabilities. Primitive buggies of various kinds are found even on higher-tech worlds, thanks to their ease of construction and maintenance compared to the delicate gravitics of more modern vehicles. ^vehicle-type-groundcars

- ***Gravcars*** are the standard personal vehicles of most TL4 worlds, though most lower-class citizens rely on public transport in urban areas. Most advanced worlds have planetary transit grids that allow occupants to simply code in a destination and let the car take them there. On worlds where a lack of infrastructure or hostile local conditions preclude such convenience, manual controls and Pilot skill can be used. ^vehicle-type-gravcars

 - ***ATV Explorers*** are rugged vehicles, either wheeled or tracked, and driven by type B power cells or locally-available biofuels. While they can't navigate rough terrain as easily as a grav vehicle, they're designed to take a tremendous amount of punishment before breaking down and support repairs using basic tools and frontier expedients. ^vehicle-type-atv-explorers

- ***Helicopters*** are used on TL3 worlds where a lack of airfields or treacherous local terrain prohibits the use of fixed-wing craft. Their ability to hover over an area or drop onto a tightly-constrained landing zone makes them particular favorites of quick-response military forces and groups in need of fast fire support. This model represents a medium-weight civilian craft that might be repurposed by militia or adventurers. ^vehicle-type-helicopters

- ***Atmoflyers*** are the fixed-wing aircraft used on planets too primitive to have developed gravitic technology. Faster and simpler to maintain than comparable helicopters, they can also carry more cargo on most worlds. The need for clear, hard terrain for landing and take-off limit their use on some rugged worlds. The model here is meant to represent a small personal jet. ^vehicle-type-atmoflyers

- ***Gravflyers*** are the usual long-distance transport on most TL4 worlds. Large enough to support the gravitics required for true flight, a few models can even reach low orbit. All can hover and climb with typical gravitic ease. This particular gravflyer is a small craft suitable for a affluent owner and their family. ^vehicle-type-gravflyers

- ***Gravtanks*** make up the bulk of a prosperous TL4 world's armored forces. Private ownership is strictly forbidden on most worlds, but “export models” often can be acquired for transport offworld. Gravtanks have armor heavy enough to ignore all damage from conventional small arms, and can only be harmed by Heavy weapons or properly-placed demolitions charges. ^vehicle-type-gravtanks

### Drones

In the far future, it's often more convenient to send an expendable grav-flying probe into danger before venturing less repairable assets. Well-prepared adventuring groups often have reason to pack along a drone or two for exploring and aerial recon.

Military use of drones is limited by the ubiquitous use of quantum ECM. The easy confusion of electronic navigation makes it impossible to control an unwired drone remotely on a modern battlefield or in proximity to important civil structures, but in the alien wilds or away from urban centers, drones remain a feasible tool for explorers and conquerors of primitive militaries.

### Piloting a Drone

Piloting a drone requires either a cybernetic drone control link as described here or a handheld control unit that comes with the drone. A control link can pilot up to one drone plus the user's Program skill at any one time. Handheld units can pilot only one. Drones consume one type A power cell for every hour of use.

A pilot must spend their Main Action each round to command the drone to either move or shoot. Uncommanded drones remain stationary if piloted via control link, while handheld units run a 2-in-6 chance of crashing a drone if the operator fails to control them.

In combat, drones fly at 30 meters per round on their pilot's turn in combat. Out of combat, they can manage up to 100 kilometers per hour.

Spotting a drone at observation range is a Wis/Notice skill check at difficulty 10. A drone close enough to engage a target can be spotted at difficulty 8. Any secure facility will have sensors capable of detecting a civilian drone as soon as it gets within observation range, unless the drone has stealth fittings.

### Drone Combat

A drone's pilot can activate up to one weapon the drone is carrying as part of their Main Action to control it each round. Weapons all use Intelligence as the controlling attribute, and use the better of the pilot's Pilot or Program skills as the relevant weapon skill. The drone shoots using the pilot's base attack bonus.

### Drone Types and Statistics

Each drone has a cost, a maximum number of fittings, an Encumbrance weight for carrying it along, a hit point rating, a maximum control range, and a minimum tech level. Drones may be attacked as any other object and will crash once reduced to zero [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points).

### Table - Drone Model Chart

| Drone Model     |   Cost | Fittings | AC  | Enc | HP  |  Range  | TL  |
| --------------- | ------:|:--------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:---:|
| Primitive Drone |    250 |    1     | 12  |  2  |  1  |  500 m  |  3  |
| Void Hawk       |  5,000 |    4     | 14  |  6  | 15  | 100 km  |  4  |
| Stalker         |  1,000 |    3     | 13  |  2  |  5  |  2 km   |  4  |
| Cuttlefish      |  2,000 |    5     | 13  |  2  | 10  |  1 km   |  4  |
| Ghostwalker     |  3,000 |    2     | 15  |  3  |  1  |  5 km   |  4  |
| Sleeper         |  2,500 |    4     | 12  |  2  |  8  | 100 km  |  4  |
| Pax             | 10,000 |    4     | 16  |  4  | 20  | 100 km  |  5  |
| Alecto          | 50,000 |    4     | 18  |  4  | 30  | 5000 km |  5  |

- ***Primitive drones*** represent the best flying portable drone technology for TL3 worlds. While fragile, weak, and short-ranged, they are also relatively cheap. ^drones-primitive-drones

- ***Void Hawks*** are unique in being built specifically for deep-space use. Unlike other drones, they can operate perfectly well in space, though they only have the range to reach relatively adjacent ships or objects. ^drones-void-hawks

- ***Stalker*** drones are the default TL4 workhorses of drone-kind and are available on most modern worlds. ^drones-stalker

- ***Cuttlefish*** are specifically designed for aqueous use, and function only in a liquid medium. The support of the liquid allows them to carry significantly more fittings, but the need for a sonar-based navigation system limits their available range. ^drones-cuttlefish

- ***Ghostwalkers*** are stealth drones, fabricated from radar-transparent materials. They have an integral *Sensor Transparency* fitting and the sensor difficulty to spot them is 11 instead of 9. ^drones-ghostwalkers

- ***Sleeper*** drones are built to tarry on station for long periods. They have the *Stationkeeping* fitting as an integral part of their design, and when hovering their power use slows to a trickle. One day of hovering draws only five minutes worth of power from its cell. ^drones-sleeper

- ***Pax*** drones are some of the most common pretech drones remaining in existence, as they were favored by the Mandate Fleet for pacifying troublesome worlds that lacked quantum ECM. While primitive by pretech standards, they still far excel most modern drones. ^drones-pax

- ***Alecto*** model of drone exemplifies one way that pretech scientists attempted to sidestep the limits of quantum ECM on the modern battlefield. Every Alecto is a full-fledged VI, an expert system so sophisticated as to seem almost sentient. Its self-reinforcing cognition allows it to operate even when cut off from external signals by quantum ECM. Salvaged Alectos have all exhibited “female” personalities. ^drones-alecto

### Drone Fittings and Repair

Aside from the basic drone chassis, operators can attach different fittings to a drone to add additional capabilities. Once attached, a fitting cannot be removed without causing severe structural damage to the drone. If a drone is destroyed, all fittings are destroyed with it.

If a drone is damaged, it can be repaired fully with one unit of spare parts per five [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points) lost and an hour's work by someone with at least Fix-0 skill.

- ***Ammo Unit:*** The drone carries one power cell or magazine worth of ammunition for each of its onboard weapons, whether single or multiple. The operator can reload an ammo unit as a Main Action. ^drones-fittings-ammo-unit

- ***Bomber:*** The drone is fitted to drop up to two grenade-sized explosives, one or both in lieu of a different weapon attack. Dropping a grenade from more than 30 meters up automatically causes the grenade to scatter from its intended target point. ^drones-fittings-bomber

- ***Environmental Power:*** The drone draws operating power from sunlight or thermal variances. It can operate indefinitely so long as it can draw power from its environment. ^drones-fittings-environmental-power

- ***Expert System:*** The drone is loaded with sophisticated self-piloting software. It can be given a flight plan by its operator, have targets designated for its weapon, and respond to simple environmental cues. Each new command takes up a Main Action and commands with any conditional states may require an Int/ Program skill check to get the drone to understand. The drone can fire only one weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of +2 if attacking autonomously. Quantum ECM will scramble this lightweight system. ^drones-fittings-expert-system

### Table - Drone Equipment

- ***Extended Flight:*** The drone can now carry a second type A cell to fuel its flight. This fitting can be taken multiple times to further extend its range. ^drones-fittings-extended-flight

- ***Grav Muffles:*** The drone is made exceptionally quiet in operation. It is now inaudible by ordinary hearing from more than five meters away. ^drones-fittings-grav-muffles

- ***Heavy Lift:*** While most drones can lift no more than a kilogram of excess weight, the drone's gravitic units have been upgraded to carry up to twenty kilos of cargo. This can be fitted multiple times. ^drones-fittings-heavy-lift

- ***Holoskin:*** The drone can drop a filmy hologram over itself, one convincing at a distance. The difficulty of visually spotting the drone becomes 10 at weapons range or 12 at observational range. Weapons fire always draws attention. ^drones-fittings-holoskin

- ***Medical Support:*** The drone can be loaded with up to a dozen units of medication, whether stim doses, lazarus patches, or less benevolent substances. It can launch a medication through a remote injector at a target within ten meters in lieu of a weapon attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while hostiles require a normal hit roll. The drone is treated as having Heal-0 skill or the active pilot's Heal skill, whichever is higher. ^drones-fittings-medical-support

- ***Observation Suite:*** All drones are wired for basic camera and sound, but this suite contains a full-spectrum UV/IR visual package, remote sound sensors, and radiation/chemical detectors. The drone can focus on conversations or facial expressions from up to 2 kilometers away and can operate even in the complete absence of visible light. ^drones-fittings-observation-suite

- ***Racing Gravitics:*** The drone is tuned for extra speed. Its flight endurance is halved, but it can now move up to 60 meters per combat round and fly at up to 200 kph out of combat. ^drones-fittings-racing-gravitics

- ***Reinforced Structure:*** The drone is equipped with heavier plating and a sturdier internal frame. Its [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points) are increased by 50%, rounded up. ^drones-fittings-reinforced-structure

- ***Sensor Transparency:*** The drone is sheathed in anti-radar composites. Ordinary sensors will not detect it at observation range, and highend military sensors can spot it only on an Int/Program check at difficulty 9. ^drones-fittings-sensor-transparency

- ***Stationkeeping:*** The drone does not need to be constantly controlled; when the operator does not spend a Main Action to pilot it, it simply remains stationary. If equipped with an *Observation Suite*, it can ping the operator if any anomalous reading is obtained. ^drones-fittings-stationkeeping

- ***Suicide Charge:*** The drone is loaded with a demo charge here. The operator can trigger it as an attack, but unless they can move the drone in by surprise, the approach will always give onlookers a chance to spot it before it gets within range. ^drones-fittings-suicide-charge

- ***Weapon Fitting:*** The drone can be mounted with 1 encumbrance worth of ranged weaponry, which must be purchased separately. This fitting may be taken more than once to mount more weapons or heavier weapons. The weapon requires one or more ammo units to feed it. ^drones-fittings-weapon-fitting


### Cyberware

Postech medical science and neural interface technology are sophisticated enough to meld metal and flesh into a coherent whole. The creation of advanced cyberware is not beyond the theoretical capability of TL4 societies, and pretech worlds can produce cyberware of such sophistication as to blur the lines between organism and artifice.

Yet cyberware is rarely available on most worlds, even those with the nominal technology level to support it. The advantages that cyberware can give a user are great, but the cost of building, fitting, and implanting these devices is huge compared to simply buying a handheld device to do the same function. There are few buyers for a 15,000 credit ghost talker implant when a compad retails for a hundred credits.

The market that does exist is largely for those few elite operatives and dignitaries who are willing to pay exorbitant sums for the smallest advantage. Most cyberware is custom-built for its users, and it can be an adventure in itself to find a lab capable of manufacturing an augmentation and successfully implanting it. Some worlds have industrialized the production of cyberware, however, making it much cheaper and in much wider circulation. Even then, these worlds rarely export much cyberware due to the heavy infrastructure necessary to fit and implant the wares. Those who want the tech will have to find such planets and do their own negotiations there.

Aside from the difficulties of cost and scarcity, cyberware also taxes the wearer's body. Each piece of cyberware comes with a System Strain cost as described here, permanently adding that many points of System Strain to the user's total. These points can never be lost unless the system is surgically removed. This permanent System Strain decreases the amount of psionic healing a character can sustain and can limit the effectiveness of healing and stimulant drugs.

Some cyberware has an activation cost in System Strain. If a cost would push the character's System Strain above their Constitution score, they cannot trigger the cyberware; their body just can't handle the strain until it has had time to recover.

- ***Adrenal Suppression Pump:*** These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user when activated while exciting the user's perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold, dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty on all social skill checks while the unit is active, and it requires five rounds to toggle it. ^cyberware-adrenal-suppression-pump

- ***Bioadaptation Augments:*** These additional synthetic organs and filters allow the bearer to survive in thin-atmosphere conditions, as well as tolerate temperatures ranging from Antarctic chill to heat sufficient to boil water. They can also eat a wide range of native life forms for sustenance; no normal planet’s native biology is ever considered immiscible for consumption. ^cyberware-bioadaptation-augments

- ***Body Arsenal Array:*** Some personnel need to be armed at all times without giving any indication of such. Improvised weaponry and conventional holdout weapons are useful enough against soft targets, but disabling a target in powered armor requires more. The details of the array vary from user to user, but usually act as advanced medium weapons that can be used with either Punch or Stab skills and at least one integral energy projector equal to a laser rifle, one that must be powered by an insertable type A power cell. Retracted body arsenals can be detected only by a medical examination. ^cyberware-body-arsenal-array

- ***Body Sculpting:*** Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced medical services. After a week of alterations and treatments a subject's external appearance can be set within any human or near-human range, including full retinal and fingerprint matching to a desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment that costs ten times as much can involve extensive DNA reprogramming to change the subject at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable and allowing female-targeted shapes to bear offspring. This TL5 treatment is not reversible, and any further major alterations to the subject require further permanent System Strain. ^cyberware-body-sculpting

- ***Dermal Armor:*** A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to anything short of a medical examination. Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs five times as much grants even more protection, rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive weapons as if they were wearing powered armor. ^cyberware-dermal-armor

- ***Drone Control Link:*** Most often found among military bot wranglers, civilians can also get a drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting of drones and other robotic units. ^cyberware-drone-control-link

 Users of a link can issue commands to a drone as a Move action instead of a Main Action. A single drone can only receive one command per round, however.

  Aside from this ease of command, someone with an implanted rig can “look” through a piloted drone's sensors as an Instant action, and a drone is never considered to be out of control even if the pilot doesn't spend an action controlling it. A link can maintain a connection with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program skill.

- ***Eelskin Capacitor Mesh:*** A hair-fine mesh of almost imperceptible wiring along the user's palms and fingers allow them to trigger brief, controlled bursts of electrical energy at targets within five meters. As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal damage to a successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it also allows the user to override and disable most electronic locks and security systems with a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering a burst and hacking a security system tax the user's biology; one System Strain point is gained with each attack or skill check. ^cyberware-eelskin-capacitor-mesh

- ***Gecko Anchors:*** Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are embedded in the subject's hands and feet as part of this complex surgery. While they are too weak to allow levitation or damping fall damage, they can twist localized gravity around those limbs to anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable of bearing their weight. As a result, the user can freely run or climb up or down sheer surfaces at their normal movement rate, carrying no more than their normal maximum encumbrance. ^cyberware-gecko-anchors

- ***Ghost Talker Transceiver:*** Some people simply cannot afford to be out of contact at any time, under any circumstances. Those people find use for the microfine web of radio wiring and optical augmentation that make up the ghost talker. These units act as a built-in compad for the user and allow for reception and transmission of audio and visual recordings, the latter playing in an inset window in the user's field of vision. If the unit is operating outside of a standard comm grid, it has a transmission range of twenty kilometers and a reception range of one hundred. Ghost talker users can transmit basic visual diagrams and images to each other, as well as optical recordings. ^cyberware-ghost-talker-transceiver

- ***Holdout Cavity:*** Usually implanted somewhere in the torso, a holdout cavity is a small recess shaped into the wearer's body and designed to be overlooked by most standard forms of medical or security scanning. It automatically defeats a security inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and even advanced tech requires careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it. The cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and is opened and shut by the user's mental command. ^cyberware-holdout-cavity

- ***Holoskin Emitter:*** Multiple holographic emitters are implanted on the user, allowing them to alter their external appearance to match anything of their approximate size and dimensions, including other people. Shifting appearances is a Main Action, and the user can't shift to an appearance that isn't in the cyberware's shape library. The library is vast and contains “generic” examples of numerous human-sized objects and people, but mimicking a specific other person requires at least five minutes of close examination. The holograms projected by the emitters are good, but imperfect; anyone who closely examines the user will be able to tell that something is artificial about their appearance, and touch instantly confirms any suspicions. The emitters can fake clothing and can produce sounds to complement the illusion or modify the user's voice, if records of the true subject are available. The disguise lasts until the user dies or ends it. ^cyberware-holoskin-emitter

- ***Identity Submersion Trigger:*** This cyberware involves micronized neural stimulation technology which is imperceptible to anything short of TL5 medical scanning or TL4 surgical examination of the subject's brain tissue. When active, the IST allows the subject to adopt a secondary persona, complete with a library of manufactured memories. So long as the IST is active, the subject will honestly and completely believe himself to be the secondary persona, a conviction that cannot be penetrated by telepathy or TL4 methods of interrogation. The persona can be activated at the user's discretion, but it only deactivates on a preset trigger, leaving the subject in full possession of all memories experienced. The trigger can be any perceptible stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a specific person, a code phrase, or any other sign, and it may be changed by the user each time they activate the cyberware. Many ISTs are also implanted with a “master key” that will automatically deactivate the triggered identity. ^cyberware-identity-submersion-trigger

- ***Immunofiltration Systems:*** This broad-spectrum scrub system carefully identifies and contains toxic substances introduced into the user's system. Whenever the subject would normally have to make a saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they may instead gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save. Most of these systems are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins or chemicals in standard use by police or military forces in the sector, but if presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the filters are less effective. In such cases, the most it can do is either grant a second saving throw if the first is failed, or grant a single saving throw if none is normally allowed. ^cyberware-immunofiltration-systems

- ***Induced Coma Trigger:*** A series of implants are wired to the user's brain stem, allowing them to trigger an induced therapeutic coma at a mental command. The user appears dead to anything short of a medical inspection, and has no need of respiration, food, or water while the coma is in effect. The user does not heal while in a coma, but any diseases or poisons also halt progression. The user determines how long the coma is to last before triggering it, and is unconscious for its duration. A character can survive in a coma up to two weeks before needing to regain consciousness for as long as they were in the coma. ^cyberware-induced-coma-trigger

- ***Neurointruder Alert:*** While somewhat primitive by pretech standards, this TL5 cybernetic implant allows the wearer to gain a +3 bonus on all saving throws to resist telepathic intrusion. Even if such a save is failed, the user will be aware that they are under telepathic assault, though some forms of mental control may not allow them to say as much until after the influence is ended. The warning does not indicate the source of the influence. ^cyberware-neurointruder-alert

- ***Panspectral Optics:*** Ocular adjustments to the wearer allow them to see clearly at any light level short of perfect darkness, in addition to giving them thermal vision that can easily distinguish shapes and distance even in the total absence of light. Dangerous radiation and lasers tuned outside the range of visible light are also visible to the user. Nearby radio transmissions can be seen as if they were visual flares of color. The system cannot translate these transmissions, only alert the user to them. ^cyberware-panspectral-optics

- ***Pressure Sheathing:*** Occasionally purchased by workers in hard vacuum or other hostile environments, pressure sheathing integrates an ultrathin pressure membrane with the user's dermis and emergency film sealants that trigger at the user's mental command. The pressure sheathing serves as an emergency vacc suit with an integral oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can sustain them for up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath needs 48 hours to regain structural integrity and power after triggering. A pressure sheath can be detected only by a close medical examination. ^cyberware-pressure-sheathing

- ***Prosthetic Limb:*** Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and numerous internal organs can be replicated by postech medical science. These prosthetics can provide a good approximation of the sense of touch, and are usually impossible to distinguish from ordinary limbs without close inspection. Pretech-level worlds tend to prefer actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with access only to ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to be grateful to prosthetics. ^cyberware-prosthetic-limb

- ***Revenant Wiring:*** One of the more grotesque results of late pretech augmentation research, revenant wiring permeates the user's body with a web of supplementary limb actuators and sensor clusters. In combat, the user may designate up to a half-dozen targets to the system's braked micro-AI. If the user goes unconscious or is killed, the micro-AI will engage the limb actuators to keep fighting, even if the user is nothing more than a ragged mass of mangled tissue. The micro-AI is not brilliant, but it is capable of negotiating most terrain and dealing with physical impediments to killing the designated targets. The actuators have power to keep operating for 3d4 rounds, or until the wearer takes 25 more [hit points](#^character-hit-points) of damage, whichever comes first. The stress produced by revenant wiring makes it much more difficult to revive a downed user with Lazarus patches or biopsionics; all revivification chances are half normal. ^cyberware-revenant-wiring

- ***Slowtime Window:*** A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the slowtime window was installed in crisis responders and others reliant on split-second decision making. When engaged, the implants accelerate the user's cogitation speed by more than three thousand percent. While there is no corresponding acceleration of the user's physical reflexes, they have time to process the situation and take in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime window cannot be surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how unexpected the attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful on the tissues, however, and one point of System Strain is gained each time it is engaged. ^cyberware-slowtime-window

- ***Stabilization Overrides:*** An intricate interweaving of microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted in the subject's torso and spinal column. These overrides can stabilize the user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced to 0 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) is automatically stabilized, as if a Lazarus patch had been successfully applied to them, assuming that a patch could have saved them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere with the ordinary operation of the user's organs, however, and the wearer's Constitution modifier is lowered by 1, with all the attendant consequences in loss of maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points). ^cyberware-stabilization-overrides

- ***Tagger Nanites:*** While true nanotechnology is beyond the grasp of standard TL4 science, this cyber allows for the implantation of very simple nanofactories in the user, ones that exude a constant imperceptible “smart dust”. Objects the user touches can be tagged by these nanites, which generate more of their kind for up to 48 hours after tagging. The dust then lays down a trail behind the tagged object, one that is visible to the user or to someone using a properly-keyed tracer. Only counter-nanite measures can remove the dust, as ordinary bathing or scrubbing is insufficient. The dust can be pinged by radio to announce its location to anyone within five kilometers, but most users prefer to leave the dust in passive mode, where it is undetectable to most TL4 sensors. Tagging an object adds one System Strain to the user. ^cyberware-tagger-nanites
 - ***Toxin Injector:*** The user's canines or fingernails are altered to allow for the injection of one of two types of poison. If the user attempts to inject an unsuspecting victim they are already touching, the attempt is automatically successful. If the victim is wary or in combat, they can only be affected if they are unarmored and the user succeeds in a Punch attack roll. On a success, the victim must make a Physical saving throw at -2 or be incapacitated by the poison, dying in 1d6 rounds or being incapacitated for 1d6 hours at the user's discretion. Each poison attack adds 2 System Strain to the user. ^cyberware-toxin-injector

- ***Twitchlock Actuators:*** Neural override fibers are woven into the user's hands and arms and linked to a perceptual modulator implanted at the base of the user's brain stem. When presented with a direct exercise of hand-eye coordination, the twitchlock can be engaged to produce superhuman accuracy and precision. Any attack roll or skill check reliant chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can be rerolled, though the power surge inflicts two points of System Strain on the user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this cyberware. While the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when engaged, the overrides fuzz ordinary nerve impulses and reduce the user's Dexterity modifier by 1 when active. Activating or deactivating the cyberware requires a Main Action. ^cyberware-twitchlock-actuators

### Artifacts

Pretech artifacts are some of the more precious loot available from lost Mandate military bases, abandoned colonies, desolate tomb worlds, and forgotten research outposts. Most pretech on modern worlds was long ago cannibalized for vital spare parts or destroyed by the ravages of time and violence. The few pieces that remain are almost always extremely valuable.

Very few pretech artifacts are bought or sold. Some items are relatively common, having been ubiquitous enough to survive in large numbers or simple enough to be produced by a few remaining modern worlds. Most artifacts, however, are so rare that there is no consistent market for them; an owner can charge what they wish for a device.

Getting that price is a different matter. Few planetary governments allow private ownership of “dangerous pretech artifacts”, and it's the government that decides what constitutes danger. Most owners are rapidly visited by firm, polite agents with heavily-armed backup and given a “fair price” for their find.

As a consequence, most trade in pretech artifacts has to take place on the black market, or on worlds or stations too lax to care about who might be bringing in a portable black hole generator that just happens to look like a Mandate child's toy. Such venues rarely provide much in the way of security or contract enforcement, and so trade has to take place amid grasping guards, paranoid participants, and regular theft.

Pretech artifacts are more often traded privately as rewards, mission payments, or exchanges between owners. A PC who wants to obtain one of the artifacts listed in this section will need to not only find someone who will admit to possessing the gear, but also find out what kind of favor they're going to need to part with it. Tens of thousands of credits can sometimes do the trick, but most owners will prefer to wring the maximum utility out of a capable adventurer's interest in their prized possessions.

### Artifact Armor

Many types of pretech armor are so rare or useful that they cannot normally be acquired on the open market. Much like artifact weaponry, these artifact armors are jealously held by those lucky enough to find them.

- ***Executive Security Suit:*** This suit of stylish pretech clothing can self-modify in one minute to appear as any normal suit of clothing and grants AC 15 to the wearer. Originally designed for VIP protection, the executive security suit automatically stabilizes a mortally-wounded wearer provided they haven't taken enough damage to make revival impossible. Like the majority of pretech artifact armor, the suit is so light that it does not add to the wearer's encumbrance. ^artifact-armor-executive-security-suit

- ***Ghost Mantle:*** Designed for use by elite infiltrators, a ghost mantle can warp light around the wearer to blur his or her outlines and coloring to match the surroundings. The mantle can self-modify in one minute to appear as any normal suit of clothing and grants AC 15 to the wearer. When used in stealth mode, it grants a +2 bonus to all Stealth-related skill checks. TL4 sensors and scanners cannot detect the mantle as anything but ordinary cloth. ^artifact-armor-ghost-mantle

- ***Polyplast Carapace:*** This variant form of assault suit employs pretech deforming polymers to create sealed joints and flexible armor plates that still maintain rigidity under impact. A polyplast carapace is treated as an assault suit with AC 18, except that it counts as only one item for encumbrance and requires no practice to use correctly. Integral kinetic absorption sinks allow the armor to function without the need for power cells. ^artifact-armor-polyplast-carapace

- ***Psitech Combat Suit:*** One of the rare psitech artifacts originally designed for use by military combat psychics, this snug-fitting armored undersuit grants the wearer an AC of 16. Its special ability functions only for psychics; it can allow the user to reflexively fuel the suit's defenses with their own psychic reserves. As an Instant action, they can Commit Effort for the day to negate up to 15 points of damage from in incoming source of physical injury. Each time they do this, they must make a Mental saving throw or the psychic conversion shock leaves them unable to use psionic techniques until after the end of their next turn. ^artifact-armor-psitech-combat-suit

- ***Stutterjump Suit:*** A modified version of the standard deflector array, a stutterjump suit grants the wearer a limited form of teleportation through integral psitech circuitry. As an Instant action, the wearer can teleport to any location within one hundred meters, provided they have an unobstructed line of sight to it. The suit's circuitry requires twelve hours to recover enough for another jump. The suit does not require power cells to function. ^artifact-armor-stutterump-suit

- ***Titan Powered Armor:*** An enormously heavy suit of servo-actuated powered armor, Titan assault plate was favored by pretech boarding parties and space marines. It grants the wearer all the usual benefits of storm armor, but has a base AC of 21 and subtracts 2 points of damage from every instance of harm suffered by the wearer. ^artifact-armor-titan-powered-armor

- ***Tempest Assault Array:*** A modified version of the field emitter panoply, the TAA has all the functionality of the FEP but also does an automatic 1d6 damage to anyone who attacks the wearer in melee, inflicting the damage after the attack is resolved. The wearer is immune to Shock damage. Kinetic sinks allow the TAA to function without the need for power cells. ^artifact-armor-tempest-assault-array

### Artifact Weaponry

While generic pretech weaponry is of superb quality and manufacture, some pieces exceed even the customary excellence of the ancients. These “artifact” weapons are usually the product of short production runs by master pretech craftsmen or individually-designed masterpieces. Some pre-Scream manufacturers retain fame even centuries later for the unique quality of their workmanship.

Artifact weapons are almost never found on the market. The few pieces that are found and offered for sale are snapped up almost immediately by elite operatives and others who rely on the quality of their hardware to preserve their own lives. Most who have artifact weaponry have either found it in a long-abandoned pretech cache, received it from a superior, or taken it from the cold hands of a former owner. Selling such a weapon tends to be equally difficult, with buyers few and untrustworthy.

### Artifact Weaponry Companies

- ***Absolution Armaments:*** A company specializing in energy weaponry, AA pioneered several techniques for increasing the energy efficiency and penetrating power of their armaments. AA laser weapons ignore particulate matter when shooting, and all AA weapons gain +1 to hit and +2 damage. ^armament-company-absolution-armaments

- ***Colonial Arms:*** An armaments company dating from the First Wave of human colonization, Colonial Arms was famous for the incredible durability and versatility of their firearms. Their guns were largely self-repairing from anything short of having pieces torn off, and their projectile weapons automatically self-adjusted to fire whatever ammunition was available, in any environment from hard vacuum to underwater operations. A Colonial Arms projectile or energy weapon also gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-colonial-arms

- ***Convergence Weaponry:*** Those weapons designed by the transhuman hive-mind polity known as the Convergence are almost always energy-based guns found in sets of 2-5 matching weapons. Wielders can nominate a target as an Instant action at the start of each round; any attacks they make with the weapon against that target get a +1 hit and damage bonus for each wielder that targeted the foe, including their own nomination. ^armament-company-convergence-weaponry

- ***Imperial Arms:*** Ornate and beautiful weapons created shortly after the horror of the Scream, these arms were developed by an unknown pocket empire that somehow preserved a little of their pretech manufacturing base. Their attempt to reimpose order on the chaos around them appears to have failed, but their legacy lingers in the scattered weapons that remain from their far-flung armies. An Imperial weapon grants its user a +1 bonus to all hit and damage rolls, with projectile weapons having an unlimited supply of ammo. These weapons always remain immaculately clean. ^armament-company-imperial-arms

- ***Fiat Lux:*** This manufacturer specialized in laser and plasma weaponry. Their products were largely conventional in function, but the quality of craftsmanship was seldom surpassed. Fiat Lux weaponry grants +2 to hit rolls and damage. ^armament-company-flat-lux

- ***Nightfall Combine:*** The exact nature of the Nightfall Combine was unclear even before the Scream, with rumors of alien xenotech manufacturing techniques and esoteric psitech materials research. The weapons produced by the Combine were some of the finest ever developed by humanity. They grant +3 to all hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-nightfall-combine

- ***Omnipresence, Ltd.:*** A pretech manufacturer who specialized in holdout weaponry, Omnipresence arms are composed of special polymorphic nano-compounds that are capable of shifting shape in moments. Omnipresence weaponry can take a single alternate shape of the same mass set during manufacture, usually a belt, necklace, or other seemingly innocuous object. When gripped and a short keycode is spoken, the item instantly shifts forms, containing whatever ammunition it was originally loaded with. Shifted Omnipresence weapons cannot be detected by any postech means; even a pretech scanner will only reveal that the object is composed of complex nanites. Omnipresence weapons grant +1 to hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-omnipresence-ltd

- ***PolyGaia Defense:*** Originally an organization of militant pan-planetary animists, PolyGaia armaments function perfectly in almost any environment. Projectile and energy weapons are also equipped with integral monoblades, and can be used as advanced medium melee weapons without a need to club the weapon. PolyGaia weaponry grants +1 to hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-polygaia-defense

- ***SamaelTech:*** The Sons of Samael were one of the myriad peculiar religious and ideological groups that flourished during the Second Wave of human expansion. While their exact beliefs are unclear at this distance, their surviving melee armament is invariably superb. Monoblades, kinesis wraps, and other such SamaelTech weaponry all have +1 to hit and +1 damage. Some SamaelTech weapons appear to be decorated with Christian iconography and advanced nanotech cutting surfaces. These pieces grant +2 to hit and damage. ^armament-company-samaeltech

- ***Stardust Micropellet System:*** The “Stardust” system was a cutting-edge effort to use gravitic manipulation techniques in projectile weaponry. By giving a tiny flake of matter the mass profile of a bullet, a Stardust weapon never runs out of ammunition, albeit Stardust weaponry cannot burst fire. Stardust weaponry gains +1 on all hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-stardust-micropellet-system

- ***Tempus Fugit:*** The weapons of the Tempus Fugit armory employed Mandate temporal acceleration generators. Such acceleration is exhausting to the user, however, and creates severe strain on a normal biological system. As an Instant action, a wielder with the weapon in hand can take an additional full round of action any time they wish. At the end of this bonus action, they suffer 1d4 System Strain, +1 for each use of this ability within the past 24 hours. If their System Strain is maximized by this, they fall unconscious for one hour. Tempus Fugit weapons have a +1 bonus to hit and damage. ^armament-company-tempus-fugit

- ***Terminus Est:*** A sister-company to Tempus Fugit, the Terminus Est line of advanced melee weaponry employed spatial distortion technology. As an Instant action at the start of a round, a wielder with the weapon in hand can nominate a visible target; for the rest of the round, they're treated as if they're adjacent and engaged in melee combat with the target, hindering ranged attacks, subjecting them to attacks if they move away without a fighting withdrawal, and so forth. The wielder is not subject to attacks by the target unless they actually are within range of the target's weapons. By straining the wielder's perception pathways, this target nomination can be applied to a number of targets equal to the wielder's Stab skill plus two. Any attack made against one target is applied to all nominated targets, using the same die rolls. Each round this multiple nomination is maintained, the wielder takes 2 System Strain. All Terminus Est weapons have a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-terminus-est

- ***Tools of Ill Omen:*** A specialist weapon line designed by sage-engineers affiliated with the Preceptors of the Great Archive, the Tools are decorated with *taotie*-motif fittings similar to those of Shang Dynasty bronzes. Tools usually appear as melee weapons, particularly halberds, dagger-axes and swords, though stylized hypervelocity repeating crossbows have been found that work like mag rifles with unlimited ammo. The Tools function with a +2 hit and damage bonus ^armament-company-tools-of-ill-omen

- ***Valiance Arms:*** Somewhat stodgy by pretech standards, Valiance never embraced the more exotic potentials of pretech science. The company instead preferred to focus on precision low-recoil projectile weapons and high-quality craftsmanship. Valiance projectile weapons grant +2 to hit and damage rolls. ^armament-company-valiance-arms

- ***Windcutter:*** Windcutter armaments are invariably edged melee weapons. Their pretech manufacturers had an obsessive interest in maximizing weapon penetration, one carried to an extent that was very impressive, if perhaps somewhat impractical for field use. A Windcutter blade can slice through any substance short of advanced pretech armor plating, inflicting full normal damage on vehicles, including gravtanks or other targets subject only to Heavy weapons. For Shock purposes, all targets are treated as if they were AC 10. Against all targets, the blades have an effective +1 bonus to hit and damage. ^armament-company-windcutter


### Artifact Equipment

- ***AI Companion:*** True AI was never easily made by pretech scientists. AIs required individual care during their development, and a disturbing percentage of them had to be “braked” at sub-human levels in order to prevent runaway cogitation on imponderable philosophical questions and the ensuing metastatic insanity that followed. Some AIs managed to attain a human level of sentience before requiring brakes. The less brilliant of these AIs could be contained in hardware no larger than five or six centimeters on a side, usually with integral sensors and vocalization units. If an AI companion takes a liking to a PC, they can be useful allies; they all have effective Program and Fix skills at level 3 or greater, and may have additional capabilities. A distressing number of these AIs have their own purposes, however, that are not necessarily complementary to those of their “owners”. ^artifact-equipment-ai-companion
- ***Integrity Stims:*** Usually found in the form of a skinspray applicator, integrity stims restore 2d6+2 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) to a subject for each dose applied. Each dose increases the target's System Strain by 1 point, and the stims are useless to those with maximized System Strain. More than one dose can be triggered into a subject in one round, but each dose after the first adds an additional second System Strain point from the sudden overload of stimulants. ^artifact-equipment-integrity-stims
- ***Juggernaut Stims:*** Originally designed for pretech shock troops, this skinspray stimulant charges the user with fearless aggression and indifference to pain. The user immediately gains 3d6 temporary [hit points](#^character-hit-points) and +2 to hit for a period of ten rounds. At the end of that period, any remaining temporary [hit points](#^character-hit-points) are lost, and the subject suffers -2 to hit for the next hour as their system recovers. Use of this stim adds 1 point of System Strain. ^artifact-equipment-juggernaut-stims
- ***Micropurgator Stims:*** A sprayhypo laden with a revivifying cocktail of nanites and support chemicals, a micropurgator stim will remove 1d4 points of accrued System Strain from the user. Only one such stim can be applied to a person within 24 hours. ^artifact-equipment-micropurgator-stims
- ***Mindwall Helmet:*** A transparent-visored helmet, this headpiece strengthens the integrity of the wearer's neural patterns, making it more difficult for them to be influenced by mind-affecting psionic powers. The wearer gains a +2 saving throw against any such attack, and is automatically alerted by the helmet if made the target of a telepathic power. The helmet does not help against purely physical psionic attacks, such as through telekinetics, and it cannot be worn with powered armor, vacc suits, or an assault suit. ^artifact-equipment-mindwall-helmet
- ***Polymorphic Nanites:*** Usually found in two-kilo cylinders with integral input-output data ports, polymorphic nanites were a late-Second Wave development that promised to revolutionize manufacturing. When fed a design schematic using standard pretech CAD/CAM protocols, the nanites exude into the desired object, mimicking any necessary physical properties. The nanites can be used to create any object of equivalent or lesser mass, provided a datapad or the equivalent is available to feed them the schematic. The nanites are single-use, but multiple cylinders can be linked together to create larger objects. The workmanship of the nanites is good, but not exceptional; any available schematic of tech level 4 or less can be produced. ^artifact-equipment-polymorphic-nanites
- ***Pseudonuke:*** While conventional TL4 nuke snuffers make dangerous nuclear reactions impossible near spaceships or modern civil defense systems, a pseudonuke is designed with esoteric pretech parts and techniques to bypass TL4 defenses. Most pseudonukes are no larger than a briefcase but can detonate with enough force to wipe out a large city or space station. The handful created before the Scream were deniable Mandate tools to deal with rebel frontier colonies. Those that survive are spectacularly illegal on almost all worlds. ^artifact-equipment-pseudonuke
- ***Redivivus Sheath:*** When found, a redivivus sheath resembles a tightly-rolled body bag with a fistsized computing module affixed to it. When a freshly-dead human body is sealed into the bag the module releases a cloud of nanites to repair and revive the subject. Revivification will work on any victim no more than five minutes dead, assuming the head is intact and most of their mass is present. Subjects are revived in critically wounded condition with maximized System Strain. The redivivus sheath functions only once before burning out. ^artifact-equipment-redivirus-sheath
- ***System Reset Inductor:*** An array of pretech pharmaceuticals of truly heroic breadth, a sprayhypo full of system reset inductor is one of the most powerful concoctions ever devised by pretech biochemists. On injection, the subject immediately loses all accrued System Strain points barring those permanently added by cyberware. The user can gain new System Strain normally, but 48 hours after the inductor has been administered, the strain will catch up with them. They fall immediately unconscious with 1 hit point and maximized System Strain, and will remain in a coma for 48 hours before awakening. Use of a second inductor before the first has run its course will inevitably kill the subject within five rounds of application, with no hope of revival by psionic disciplines or conventional medical aid. ^artifact-equipment-system-reset-inductor
- ***Wideawake Serum:*** Originally designed to facilitate spike drills for single-man ships that couldn't afford a sleeping pilot, wideawake serum gives the user enormous vigor and alertness for up to seven days at a time. The user need not sleep or even rest, but during this time it is impossible to recover accrued System Strain. A successful Heal check at difficulty 10, made at most once per day, can flush the drug from the user prematurely. ^artifact-equipment-wideawake-serum

### Modding and Building Equipment

While truly sophisticated research and design often requires resources beyond the reach of an adventuring party, more modest workshops can allow a talented technician with a healthy supply of after-market parts to improve the quality of their own or their allies' gear. Without a full-fledged R&D department behind them, a PC technician is generally limited to modifying and improving existing gear.

A mod is an adjustment made to a specific piece of tech to make it work better. These mods are finicky, delicate, and often customized to the user. They aren't generally available on the market because they require regular tuning and adjustment by a highly-skilled technician in order to keep them from degrading, or even failing entirely. Mods require costly after-market parts that can be expensive to acquire, and the most sophisticated ones require actual pretech salvage stripped from advanced ancient technology. Normally, only TL4 gear can be effectively modded, as more primitive tech isn't suitable for the advanced components involved.

### Installing Mods

Building and installing a mod requires a wellequipped TL4 workshop. It's not necessary to have a full-fledged fabrication plant, but the sort of resources that a professional repair tech or vehicle shop have are necessary to assemble and adjust the tech. Such a shop can usually be rented for 100 credits a day, or bought outright in a city or other urban area for 25,000 credits. A starship's “Workshop” ship fitting will also qualify.

Mods have a minimum Fix skill required to install or maintain them; a *Customized* mod requires Fix-1, for example, while a *Flexible* mod takes Fix-2. Without this skill level, the tech can't build or install the mod, and they can't maintain it properly either.

Mods have a cost in credits or salvage. A tech with access to a normal TL4 parts market can buy components with a credit cost, but certain highly sophisticated mods require pretech components that can only be salvaged from certain ancient Mandate-era technological devices. Not just any device will do for gathering these components; these micronized fusion taps, antigrav nodules, impact flexors, and polymorphic state controllers are found in only certain Mandate tech or in rare ancient caches of unused components. A tech will usually have to find these components as part of an adventure, because those who have them need them for their own purposes and will not part with them for ordinary monetary compensation. The specific details of these parts don't matter for mod use, and they're simply tracked as “salvage”. If a mod requires three units of salvage, any three units will work, and it's not normally necessary for a tech to track down specific components.

Mods take time to build and install. It takes one week per minimum skill level of the mod to build and install it in the desired device. Thus, a *Customized* mod takes a week to put in, while a *Flexible* mod takes two. If a tech does nothing other than work, eat, and sleep, they can halve these times, and an additional assistant with at least Fix-0 skill can further halve the time.

Mods must be custom-built to specific objects. A tech cannot build a “generic” mod and then just attach it to a device; it must be carefully designed to fit exactly with that specific item, and sometimes even with a specific user.

### Mods and Maintenance

Mods require maintenance to keep functioning correctly. Overclocked hardware, bleeding-edge tech, and experimental adjustments just don't have the field durability of more standard gear, so a tech must apply daily attention to the modded hardware if it's not to fail. A normal TL4 toolbox is required to maintain mods, but no special parts are needed.

A tech's Maintenance score is equal to the total of their Intelligence and Constitution modifiers plus three times their Fix skill level. The smarter and the longer a tech can work, the more maintenance they can perform, but their overall expertise as a technician is the most crucial element. A tech can maintain a number of mods equal to their Maintenance score without cutting into their adventuring time or otherwise encumbering their off-duty hours. This maintenance is assumed to take place during downtime and doesn't need to be tracked specifically in play. If they do nothing but maintenance, they can double their score, but this kind of dedication requires sixteen-hour workdays.

If a mod goes without maintenance for 24 hours, it stops working. If a mod goes without maintenance for a week, the entire device it's attached to stops working, as the untuned mod has made it useless or dangerous to use. Weapons can no longer be used in combat, armor no longer gives protection, seizes up, or is too dangerous to wear, and other devices simply stop functioning. A maintenance backlog on a device can be cleared by an hour of work by a technician capable of maintaining it.

### Building Conventional Gear

Sometimes a wrench jockey will want to build their own equipment rather than purchase it off the shelf. This may be because there's no such gear for sale, the equipment is illegal on this world, the tech wants it cheaper than the vendors sell it, or the tech wants to build a custom platform for their favorite mods. The gear built this way must be feasible to create in a workshop; guns, armor, and modestly-sized vehicles are possible, but starship components and other major constructions are not.

A tech requires a TL4 workshop to build most TL4 equipment. More primitive gear can be built with less elaborate resources at the GM's discretion. The workshop must be at least nominally capable of working with the kind of gear the tech is building. A vehicle repair shop will not have the tools to brew pharmaceuticals, and a back-room electronics shop won't have the lifts to work on armored vehicles. If the tech needs to refit a workshop to work on a particular type of unsupported gear, they can pay half the shop's original price to get the needed tools. [Starships](#Starships) with *Workshop* fittings are always sufficient for personal gear modifications.

The tech needs a supply of parts. In any TL4 city or sizable community, the tech can scrounge, barter, or buy what they need from the locals. A tech working in a shop out in the wilds can prepare by taking a few footlockers full of materials that can fit in a vehicle or on pack animals, buying a certain number of credits worth of spare parts and hauling them along. Techs in dire need can strip ancient high-tech ruins, battlefields, and scrap heaps for parts if no better source is available.

Techs must decide whether the device they're building is to be jury-rigged, normal, or mastercrafted. Jury-rigged devices are assembled out of cheap scrap, bottom-tier components, and makeshift kludges. They're much cheaper to make than to buy, but they require constant attention to keep them operating. Normal devices work just as well as anything that you'd buy off the shelf, but the lack of economies of scale and the need to acquire all the parts at retail make them more expensive than buying it off the shelf. Mastercrafted gear is carefully built to support a tech's own innovations and favorite modifications. They are extremely expensive, but much easier to mod and maintain than off-the-shelf tech.

Building the gear usually takes one month for a vehicle and one week for a weapon, suit of armor, or other portable device. Having at least one assistant with Fix-0 will halve this time.

Jury-rigged devices cost one-quarter as much as the normal device and take half the normal time to build. If the tech has access to scrap or salvage, they can assemble it at no cost, but it takes twice the normal time to build it. A jury-rigged device counts as a mod requiring Fix-0 to maintain. If it goes 24 hours without maintenance, it stops working. Jury-rigged devices cannot be modded.

Normal devices cost twice as much as they would off-the-shelf and take the normal amount of time to build. They cannot be built with scrap or salvaged parts unless the GM decides that the salvage is perfectly suited for this use. Drugs and other consumable goods must be built as normal devices rather than jury-rigged or mastercrafted ones.

Mastercrafted devices require costly premade components and cost ten times as much as the normal device, and require twice as much time to build. They are ideal platforms for the tech's own modifications, however, and the first mod installed in the device requires no maintenance.

### Sample Mods

The mods listed below are simply a sample of those a GM might approve for their campaign. Weapon and armor mods should not stack beyond a +3 bonus to AC, hit rolls or damage rolls, and any mod improving a skill check shouldn't boost it by more than +1. A mod can only be installed once on any given piece of equipment.

- ***Autotargeting (Fix-2):*** The weapon has had micronized kinetic targeting aids installed, granting a +1 bonus to hit rolls with it. Costs 4,000 credits. ^sample-mods-autotargeting

- ***Boosted (Fix-2):*** The weapon has been tuned for greater damage output, adding +2 to the damage it does. Costs 2,000 credits. ^sample-mods-boosted

- ***Bubbleseal (Fix-1):*** The armor is equipped with automatic pressure seals and emergency oxygen. It can be triggered manually or activates automatically on exposure to low pressure, functioning as a vacc suit for up to one hour. Costs 5,000 credits. ^sample-mods-bubbleseal

- ***Concealed (Fix-2):*** The device is disguised as a specific different object of the same general mass. This disguise will fool standard TL4 sensors, but not a close physical inspection of the object. Costs ten times the device's base cost. ^sample-mods-concealed

- ***Customized (Fix-1):*** The weapon or armor has been carefully tailored to a single specific user. When used by that person, they get a +1 to hit with the weapon or a +1 Armor Class bonus with armor. Costs 1,000 credits and is inapplicable to shields. ^sample-mods-customized

- **Extended Magazine *(Fix-1):*** The firearm has been adjusted so that its magazine size is doubled. Costs 500 credits. ^sample-mods-extended-magazine

- ***Flexible (Fix-2):*** The armor is carefully tailored to a specific wearer with an eye towards reducing its weight and cumbersomeness. Its Encumbrance value is lowered by 1 for that wearer, and increased by 1 for anyone else. Costs 5,000 credits. ^sample-mods-flexible

- ***High Efficiency (Fix-1):*** A device with a duration of operation, such as a vacc suit or fueled vehicle, now functions for 50% longer on the same charge. Costs five times the device's usual cost. ^sample-mods-high-efficiency

- ***Infinite Magazine (Fix-3):*** The firearm now automatically produces its own physical ammunition. Costs 10,000 credits and two units of pretech salvage. ^sample-mods-infinite-magazine

- ***Infinite Power (Fix-3):*** A device powered by a Type A power cell now never runs out of power. Costs 5,000 credits and one unit of pretech salvage. ^sample-mods-infinite-power

- ***Phasing (Fix-3):*** The weapon is tuned to partially phase through armor and impeding debris, granting a +1 bonus to hit rolls with it. Costs 10,000 credits and two units of pretech salvage. ^sample-mods-phasing

- ***Polymorphic Blending (Fix-2):*** The armor can shift in appearance to that of normal clothing or different-looking armor. Several dozen different appearances can be loaded into it at any one time. The armor functions and encumbers normally regardless of its external appearance. Costs 5,000 credits and one unit of pretech salvage. ^sample-mods-polymorphic-blending

# STARSHIPS

Countless ships rise from world upon world, the iron dust of new-forged shipyards sent out to make bridges between the stars. For centuries, the privation and chaos that followed the Scream have made any concern beyond bare survival a luxury for all too many worlds. The last century has seen a reawakening, however, as myriad planets finally unlock the secrets of their own worlds and learn to use their native resources to rebuild the longlost ships of their ancestors. The Silence is ending and worlds are now beginning to reach out to their unknown neighbors.

Different sectors have different degrees of development. In some regions of space, starships have now been manufactured for centuries, with small spacecraft easily obtained by private individuals and modest companies. These sectors have regular commerce between worlds, with interstellar drills no more remarkable than modern air travel. Aliens and offworlder humans are noticed but go without special remark. These sectors often have relatively large stellar polities made up of numerous member stars, ones which often share the same general culture or political form. These sectors may still have backward planets or unknown worlds, but these are the exception.

In most ***Stars Without Number*** sectors, however, things aren't that developed. Some worlds will have developed or retained functional shipyards and interstellar flight is not anything remarkable to their citizens, but ownership of a starship is still a rare thing. Entire planetary navies might have fewer than a dozen ships, and only powerful and influential worlds will be sporting cruisers or other heavy warships. There is enough commercial traffic to justify starports and trade stations, but free and easy transit between worlds has been lost for centuries, and is only slowly returning to the sector.

These sectors are rich in potential adventure. Even developed worlds may not be completely familiar with their stellar neighbors, and a number of lost worlds and out-of-contact societies can still be found in the sector. Starship captains can never be entirely certain what they're going to meet when they drill into such a system, and no world is strong enough to exert its will carelessly around distant stars.

## Acquiring Starships

In most sectors, it's possible to buy civilian starships on any TL4 world. Such civilian ships are almost exclusively fighter or frigate-class hulls, most usually free merchants or in-system shuttles, though a few wealthy worlds offer bulk freighter hulls as well. These ships might be armed to the extent that their buyer's purse allows, but they are no match for real warships, and so few planets worry too much about who might buy them. Conspicuous acquisition of numerous armed merchants, however, might draw unwelcome interest.

Military hulls are a different matter. Even a lowly patrol boat is rarely permitted to a civilian buyer, let alone a fleet cruiser or other ship of the line. Even when these ships can be purchased, crewing them adequately can be far beyond the limits of an adventuring party's purse. Even so, heroes who make the right friends or do the right favors to a planetary government can sometimes get letters of marque that entitle them to purchase hulls that would not normally be allowed into civilian hands.

Buying a ship is only one way to acquire it, however. Many adventurers find it more efficient to liberate a craft from undeserving owners, with an evening's play revolving around the daring deeds and cunning subterfuge needed to acquire or salvage a ship for the party. Of course, the craft acquired by this means are rarely in perfect condition.

The ship and fitting prices that follow in this section assume that starships are uncommon and expensive investments, as they are in most sectors. If you are running a campaign in a region of easier access to ships, you should halve or even quarter the prices.

## Navies and Piracy

Most TL4 worlds have some sort of space navy, even if it's only a handful of patrol boats to watch the asteroid mines and monitor orbital space around their homeworld. A typical poor world might have a corvette and a half-dozen patrol boats, while the average TL4 planet sports a fleet cruiser, four corvettes or heavy frigates, and ten patrol boats, and a rich planet might have three times as many ships, possibly even a battleship or carrier to form the heart of its fleet. A third of these ships are usually in dock at any one time.

The threat of piracy varies from system to system. Pirates need a safe place to refit their ships and sell their stolen goods, and they need enough traffic to justify their trade. The ideal pirate system is one containing only a low-tech primitive world that can be raided for slaves and supplies, with a hidden or mobile deep-space repair base for maintenance, and two or more wealthy neighboring systems that send trade through. Such a pirate nest can persist for years, with system governments arguing over who should bear the cost of rooting them out, or too weak to overcome a charismatic pirate leader and their loot-hungry followers.

Very few pirates operate in a system with a strong naval presence. Small ships can sometimes get away with it for a time, hiding out in asteroid belts, striking merchants from ambush, and fleeing to safer systems before help can arrive. Larger pirate flotillas are a more existential threat to a planetary navy, and they are soon dispersed&hellip; or made the effective masters of the system as they blow up any ship that could prevent them from obtaining space supremacy.

## Building a Starship

Creating a starship in ***Stars Without Number*** is fairly simple, and requires only a few steps.

First, pick a hull type for the ship from the list below. The type will indicate the price of the base hull with a drive-1 spike drive, along with the available free power and mass.

Second, add fittings, weapons, and defenses from the pages that follow. Each such addition takes up a certain amount of power and mass, and may have a minimum hull size required for installation. Some fittings and defenses cost more in money, power, or mass when installed on larger ships.

Third, decide how many crew members the ship will have. Most merchantmen run with no more than twice the minimum number of crew to save on wages. Warships rarely leave port with less than 75% of the maximum crew allowed. On average, crew members cost 100 credits a day in wages, plus 20 more for necessary food and stores. PCs, naturally, are unlikely to charge themselves wages, but they need to eat. ^starship-crew-cost

Fourth, note down the six-month maintenance cost of the ship, which is equal to 5% of its total non-crew cost. If this fee isn't paid, a -1 penalty is applied to all skill checks and hit rolls related to the ship for each maintenance period skipped.

Lastly, fill in a ship record for the craft, marking down the ship's statistics and the attack bonuses for the gunners using the ship's weapons.

The speed of building or modifying a ship will depend on the quality of available shipyards and the political importance of the job. On average, 25,000 credits a day of work or modifications can be done by most shipyards on average-importance jobs. Enough reason to rush can double or even quadruple this amount.

## Starship Hulls

Starship hulls are divided into four general hull classes: fighters, frigates, cruisers, and capital ships. The size of each class varies depending on the technological sophistication and available resources of their creators. In some sectors a smuggler's free merchant frigate might measure no more than 34.75 meters from nose to tail, while in another it might be four times as large. As a general proportion, each class' average size is usually from four to eight times larger than the class before it.

Each hull has several base attributes. Individual models might vary slightly, and careful tuning and customization might alter these numbers as described later, but most ships of a given hull type will perform as listed.

- ***Cost*** is the price of the base hull with a drive-1 class spike drive. Any military hull type is generally unavailable without very good naval contacts with a shipyard's owning government or a carefully-placed favor to those in authority. ^starship-cost

- ***Speed*** is the relative combat speed and maneuverability of a ship. Over long distances a ship's spike drive rating is all that matters, but in the tight quarters of combat this can make a great difference. A ship's Speed is added to all Pilot skill checks made by the craft's pilot, whether in combat or performing other maneuvers. ^starship-speed

- ***Armor*** is the measure of the ship's plating and redundant systems, and is subtracted from any incoming damage from hostile fire or hazardous space environments. Ship-mounted weapons with the Armor Piercing trait may ignore part or all of this rating. Ships generally cannot be harmed by anything short of other ship's guns, vehicle-mounted Heavy weapons or carefully-placed demo charges. ^starship-armor

- ***Hit Points*** reflects the amount of damage the ship can take before it explodes or becomes inoperable. ^starship-hit-points

- ***Crew*** lists the minimum crew necessary for basic operation and the maximum crew the life support system can sustain for two months. Smaller crews than the maximum will make the ship's life support last proportionately longer. While it's theoretically possible for a lone crewman to make a successful spike drill, the constant vigilance and wakefulness required mandates the use of heavy pharmaceuticals and great desperation. A minimum of three crew are normally required for a relatively safe drill. ^starship-crew

- ***Armor Class*** is a combination of agility and effective ECM denoting the difficulty of landing a solid hit on the ship. ^starship-armor-class

- ***Power*** is the amount of free power available after the ship's basic operation is taken into account. Fittings and weapons take up some part of this power. ^starship-power

- ***Mass*** records the amount of free mass left unassigned by the hull's design. This free mass can be filled with fittings, weapons, or cargo holds. ^starship-mass

- ***Hardpoints*** indicate how many weapons a ship can successfully mount. Most weapons take up one hardpoint, though particularly large or power-hungry ones may take up more than that. ^starship-hardpoints

Finally, the ***class*** of the particular hull shows the general size of the ship. Some fittings and weapons have a minimum hull class, beneath which a ship is just too small to successfully install the hardware. ^starship-hull-class

Starship hulls are sturdy enough to ignore damage from small arms or TL3 Heavy weapons. TL4 Heavy weapons or demo charges applied to the exterior of a ship do half damage minus the ship's Armor. If a saboteur gets inside with such weapons, the damage is halved but Armor does not apply. Use of some Heavy weapons in confined areas may be decidedly imprudent.

## Hull Types

The hull types listed below are some of the most common models found throughout the remnants of human space. Individual worlds often experiment with different vessels as they gradually develop their own astronautic doctrines, but these models have the benefit of long and proven utility.

- ***Strike Fighter:*** Small craft, often modified to replace the spike drive with a system drive. Their speed, cheapness, and combat utility make them a popular choice as inexpensive system patrol craft. ^hull-types-strike-fighter

- ***Shuttle:*** The smallest craft that's regularly used for interstellar drills, a shuttle is a cheap means of moving small amounts of precious material or important persons between worlds. ^hull-types-shuttle

- ***Free Merchant:*** A hull type much beloved by adventurers, a free merchant has unimpressive combat utility but can carry substantial amounts of cargo while mounting enough weaponry to discourage small-craft piracy. ^hull-types-free-merchant

- ***Patrol Boat:*** The hull of choice for customs cutters and system law enforcement, the patrol boat is a light frigate built heavy enough to overawe small merchant vessels while still being relatively cheap to build and crew. ^hull-types-patrol-boat

- ***Corvette:*** The smallest true combat frigate, and often simply called a “frigate” by spacers. Corvettes have significantly thicker armor than patrol boats and trade additional crew needs and less maneuverability for more available free mass. ^hull-types-corvette

### Table - Example Hull Types

| Hull Type      | AC  | Power | Mass | Hard. |  Class  |
| -------------- |:---:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Strike Fighter | 16  |   5   |  2   |   1   | Fighter |

| Small Station  | 11  |  50   |  40  |  10   | Cruiser |

- ***Heavy Frigate:*** The heaviest starship that most poor or resource-deprived worlds can build, the heavy frigate can carry a significant loadout of weaponry and has enough crew to overwhelm most pirate ships if it comes to a boarding action. While it packs a substantial punch, it lacks the armor of a true cruiser-class warship. ^hull-types-heavy-frigate

- ***Bulk Freighter:*** This class of huge cargo ship is found most often in peaceful, heavily-populated sectors. ^hull-types-bulk-freighter

- ***Fleet Cruiser:*** The favored ship of the line of most wealthy, advanced worlds, and often the biggest and most powerful ship most planets can build. A cruiser's heavy armor and infrastructural support for heavy guns make it a lethal weapon against frigates and any other ship not optimized for cracking heavy armor. They can prove vulnerable to swarm attacks by fighter-bombers equipped with the right kind of armor-piercing weapons. ^hull-types-fleet-cruiser

- ***Battleship:*** Dreaded hulks of interstellar war, very few worlds have the necessary technology or economy to support the massive expense of building and crewing a battleship. Those that do gain access to a ship that is largely invulnerable to anything short of specially-designed anti-capital cruisers or hunter-killer frigates. ^hull-types-battleship

- ***Carrier:*** The queen of a fleet, even fewer polities can afford to build one of these huge ships. Carriers can support flights of fighter or frigate-class warships, ones specially equipped to handle particular missions. This versatility allows it to load fighter-bombers for anti-capital missions one month, and then switch to swarms of hunter-killer frigates the next when a hostile system's asteroid outposts need to be destroyed. Stripped of its combat wings, however, a carrier has less individual firepower than a cruiser. ^hull-types-carrier

- ***Stations:*** Almost every space-faring world has at least one space station in orbit. A station has no Speed score, no spike drive, and cannot perform any maneuvers in combat, though its transit jets can slowly move it around a solar system over a matter of weeks. Civilian trade stations allow for docking by bulk freighters and ships not cleared to land on the surface, while military stations strictly forbid any civilian docking. The small station listed here is a Bannerjee-12, a common model found on poor or backwater worlds with little traffic. The large station represents an Arx, a major trade station for a hub world with money to spare. ^hull-types-stations


## Starship Fittings

The following list of ship fittings are largely standard TL4 technologies that are available in most sectors. A few items on the list are rare pretech devices that cannot be acquired without special connections or a lucky feat of salvage.

Some costs are marked with an asterisk. These costs are multiplied by 10 when the fitting is installed in a frigate-class hull, by 25 when installed in a cruiser-class hull, and by 100 when installed in a capital ship.

Some power and mass entries are marked with a hashmark. These costs are multiplied by 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ships, rounded up. Note that you apply these multipliers even if the fitting only works on a large ship; a frigate with a *Drill Course Regulator* pays 250,000 credits, not 25,000.

- ***Advanced research lab:*** A lab suitable for investigating alien xenolife, planetary geology, esoteric technology, and other mysteries of the cosmos. The lab contains cold sleep pods adequate to contain alien samples, viro-shielded research cells, high-energy lasers, and other requisite tools. When used to investigate some phenomenon or object, any applicable skill rolls are improved by +1 for a frigate lab, +2 for a cruiser lab, and +3 for a capital ship lab. ^starship-fittings-advanced-research-lab

- ***Advanced nav computer:*** Forging new spike courses is too much an art to rely on computerized assistance, but an advanced nav computer can help on well-mapped routes. When navigating an interstellar drill course with charts less than a year old, the navigator decreases drill difficulty by 2. ^starship-fittings-advanced-nav-computer

- ***Amphibious operation:*** This fitting includes the benefits of the *Atmospheric Configuration* fitting, as well as allowing the ship to operate while immersed in a liquid medium. Submerged ships cannot be detected with conventional planetary traffic sensors and require military sonar and naval sensors to fix their position, resources often unavailable on less developed worlds. So long as the ship stays away from military naval craft and bases, it is almost impossible to track while submerged. Only fighter and frigate hull classes can mount this fitting. ^starship-fittings-amphibious-operation

- ***Armory:*** Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4 military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete it. ^starship-fittings-armory

- ***Atmospheric configuration:*** This fitting must be put in place when the ship is built, and cannot be installed on cruiser-class or larger ships. A ship designed for atmospheric flight can land on most solid or aqueous surfaces. ^starship-fittings-atmospheric-configuration

- ***Auto-targeting system:*** Some ships run with more guns than crewmen. A single NPC or PC can man one gun per round, firing it as often as the gunnery chief's *Fire One Weapon* or *Fire All Guns* actions allow, but sometimes that's not enough. Installing an autonomic targeting system for a gun allows it to shoot at a +2 hit bonus without human assistance. This system must be installed once for each gun that is to be self-manned. ^starship-fittings-auto-targeting-system

- ***Automation support:*** The ship has been carefully fitted to support the use of non-sentient expert system robots in its operation. At least one human, VI, or True AI crew member is necessary to oversee the bots and monitor spike drills, but otherwise crew may be replaced with cheap, basic robots at a cost of 1,000 credits per crew member replaced. Bots don't draw pay, don't take up life support, and their maintenance is assumed to be part of the ship's operating costs. These bots are incapable of any actions unrelated to operating the ship and are treated as level-0 in their skills where relevant. ^starship-fittings-automation-support

- ***Boarding tubes:*** Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures can be used to forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided the target's engines have been disabled. Ships without boarding tubes have to send invaders across empty space to either make an assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded airlock or cut their way in through the hull with laser cutters and half an hour of work. ^starship-fittings-boarding-tubes

- ***Cargo lighter:*** Cruisers and larger craft can't land on planetary bodies, so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to a standard pressurized cargo container holding up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These containers are usually collapsible and take up no significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they're not simply disposable cargo shells. This fitting can be purchased multiple times. ^starship-fittings-cargo-lighter

- ***Cargo space:*** Free mass can be traded for pressurized cargo space. Tracked by weight for convenience, one cubic meter is usually one ton, with most vehicles requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks taking 25, and aircraft or mechs taking up 50 tons of cargo space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons of cargo space in a fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200 tons in a cruiser, and 2000 tons in a capital-class ship. This fitting can be purchased multiple times. ^starship-fittings-cargo-space

- ***Cold sleep pods:*** These stasis pods can keep a subject alive for centuries provided that the ship's power doesn't fail. Each installation allows for keeping a number of people equal to the ship's maximum crew in stasis indefinitely. This fitting can be installed multiple times. ^starship-fittings-cold-sleep-pods

- ***Colony core:*** The ship has been designed to act as the core of a future settlement. Once this fitting is engaged, the ship ceases to be operational as a starship, and builds out into a set of habitats, hydroponic gardens, fusion plants, and living spaces sufficient to support up to five times its maximum crew, including enough fabrication and workshop facilities to keep the settlement operational under normal conditions. The settlement can be a deep-space hab, orbital installation, or planetary settlement. In the latter case, the ship must land to form the settlement; even ships without atmospheric operations can do so, but they can never take off again. Once activated, a colony core cannot be re-packed. ^starship-fittings-colony-core

- ***Drill course regulator:*** Drills along a known spike drive route have no chance of failure so long as the route is no longer than twice the operating pilot's skill level and does not involve course trimming. Thus, a navigator with Pilot-1 skill would always succeed in making a drill of two hexes or less, provided the route was a known one. The drill course regulator requires a sophisticated technical base and compatible metadimensional energy conditions in a given sector; many sectors no longer have this technology or lack the right environment to use it. If the GM prefers a campaign where space travel is always at least somewhat dangerous, they may deny access to this fitting. Ships piloted by exceptionally talented navigators may choose not to mount it even then. ^starship-fittings-drill-course-regulator

- ***Drive upgrades:*** A ship can improve its standard-issue [drive-1](#^spike-drive-rating) spike drive with additional phase filters and power throughput refinements. A captain needs buy only the final grade of drive desired. He does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that cannot be built most modern worlds. ^starship-fittings-drive-upgrades

- ***Drop pod:*** Armored and stealthed versions of cargo lighters, these craft are twice as fast, apply a -3 penalty to tracking and targeting skill checks, and can carry up to one hundred troops or passengers. Many are equipped with assorted Heavy weapons to clear the landing zone, and can be treated as flight-capable gravtanks for purposes of combat. This fitting can be purchased multiple times. ^starship-fittings-drop-pod

- ***Emissions dampers:*** Stealth systems can mask the ship's energy emissions through careful modulation of the output. All travel times inside a star system are doubled when the system is engaged, but any skill checks to avoid detection gain a +2 bonus. ^starship-fittings-emissions-dampers

- ***Exodus bay:*** These banked rows of compressed cold sleep pods are designed to carry enormous numbers of people in extended hibernation, most often colonists to some new homeworld or escapees from some stellar disaster. A cruiser can carry up to 1,000 colonists in stasis, while a capital ship can handle up to 5,000. Each further time this fitting is selected, these numbers double. These pods put their inhabitants into very deep hibernation so as to minimize the resources necessary to maintain their lives. Bringing them out of this stasis requires a month of “defrost”. Crash awakenings have a 25% chance of killing the subject. The pods are rated for 100 years of stasis, but their actual maximum duration is somewhat speculative. ^starship-fittings-exodus-bay

- ***Extended life support:*** The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew or passengers. Extended life support can be fitted multiple times; each time, the maximum crew rating of the ship increases by 100% of its normal maximum. Thus, a free merchant who installs this twice can have a maximum complement of 18 people. ^starship-fittings-extended-life-support

- ***Extended medbay:*** All ships are equipped with basic medical facilities for curing lightly injured crew members and keeping the seriously injured ones stable until reaching a planet. An extended medbay improves those facilities, allowing for the medical treatment of up to the ship's entire maximum crew at once, including the treatment of critically wounded passengers. ^starship-fittings-extended-medbay

- ***Extended stores:*** A normal complement of ship's stores can keep the maximum crew size supplied for two months. Each selection of *Extended Stores* doubles that time, and can be fitted multiple times. ^starship-fittings-extended-stores

- ***Fuel bunkers:*** Most ships require refueling after each drill jump, no matter the distance. Installing fuel bunkers allows the ship to carry one additional load of fuel. This fitting can be installed multiple times for ships that wish to minimize fueling. ^starship-fittings-fuel-bunkers

- ***Fuel scoops:*** Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction of hydrogen from gas giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process requires four days of processing and refinement, but completely refuels the ship. Such fittings are common on explorer craft that cannot expect to find refueling stations. ^starship-fittings-fuel-scoops

- ***Hydroponic production:*** Some ships are designed to produce food and air supplies for the crew. Selecting hydroponic production allows for the indefinite supply of a number of crewmen equal to the ship's maximum crew. This option may be taken multiple times for farm ships, in which case each additional selection doubles the number of people the ship can support. ^starship-fittings-hydroponic-production

- ***Lifeboats:*** Selecting this fitting equips the ship with a number of single-use escape craft capable of reaching the nearest habitable planet or station in a star system. If no such destination exists, the boats can maintain their passengers for up to a year in drugged semi-stasis. Lifeboats have fully-functional comm systems and are usually equipped with basic survival supplies and distress beacons. A single selection of this fitting provides enough lifeboats for a ship's maximum crew, with up to twenty people per boat. ^starship-fittings-lifeboats

- ***Luxury cabins:*** Each time this fitting is selected, 10% of the ship's maximum crew gain access to luxury cabins of a spaciousness sufficient to please a wealthy star-farer. This fitting comes with the usual zero-gee athletic courts, decorative fountains, fine dining, and artistic fittings. ^starship-fittings-luxury-cabins

- ***Mobile extractor:*** Automated mining and refinery equipment has been built into the ship, allowing it to extract resources from asteroids and planetary surfaces. Careful extraction of specific lodes of valuable minerals can be quite profitable at the GM's discretion, but if the crew is simply melting down available asteroids for raw materials, the unit can refine one ton of usable materials per day worth about 500 credits in most markets. These raw materials can be used to feed a mobile factory, and a ship may have more than one mobile extractor fitted to it to multiply the return if sufficient raw feedstock is available. Operating an extractor requires at least five crew members. ^starship-fittings-mobile-extractor

- ***Mobile factory:*** The ship is equipped with a fullscale TL4 fabrication plant programmed to support its needs. The ship can stock raw materials and parts at 5,000 credits per ton; these parts can then be used to “pay” ship repair or maintenance costs when conventional shipyards are unavailable. The factory can also create and repair vehicles, TL4 equipment, space habs, and planetary structures with these parts at a rate of 10,000 credits worth of construction a day. If a mobile extractor is available, the raw materials processed by the latter unit can be used to feed the factory. Operating a mobile factory requires at least 100 well-trained personnel. Each 10 fewer available doubles repair or maintenance times. ^starship-fittings-mobile-factory

- ***Precognitive nav chamber:*** An extremely rare example of psitech dating from before the Scream, a precognitive nav chamber allows a character with at least Precognition-2 psionic skill to assist in interstellar drills, sensing impending shear alterations before they happen. The navigator automatically succeeds on any spike drill check of difficulty 9 or less. On a failed check, add 2 to the Spike Drive Mishap roll, limiting the potential damage. On drilling in to the destination system, the psychic has expended all Effort in the process. ^starship-fittings-precognitive-nav-chamber

- ***Psionic anchorpoint:*** This pretech relic is unavailable on the open market in most sectors. Once installed in a ship, it can be “imprinted” by up to a dozen psychics. These psychics can sense and affect any object or location within ten meters of the relic after one minute of concentration, provided they are within the same solar system. Thus, teleporters can always teleport next to the anchorpoint, telepaths can always contact anyone within the affected zone, telekinetics can manipulate objects near the relic, and so forth. The relic can be recoded to eliminate existing imprints, but any psychic who gets access to the relic for ten minutes of meditation and focus can imprint on it afterwards. There is no obvious way to tell how many psychics have imprinted to the anchorpoint. ^starship-fittings-psionic-anchorpoint

- ***Sensor mask:*** The ship can disguise its long-range sensor readings, spoofing scans with the ID tags and apparent hull type of any other ship of its choice. To penetrate this masquerade, the scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program skill check against difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking ship's comms officer. Once the ship is close enough to visually identify, the masking is useless. ^starship-fittings-sensor-mask

- ***Ship bays:*** These sophisticated docking bays provide all the necessary tools and support for launching a starship from the mother craft. They are rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers, but some cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay allows room for one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the carried ship can support its own crew if necessary, most carriers fold their space wing into the mothership's crew roster. This fitting can be taken multiple times. ^starship-fittings-ship-bays

- ***Ship’s locker:*** Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship's locker in amounts commensurate with the ship's size. A few guns and some basic armor might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is restocked. ^starship-fittings-ships-locker

- ***Shiptender mount:*** The ship is designed with symbiosis mounts that allow other ships to “hitch” on the craft's spike drills. Each shiptender mount allows one craft of a hull size smaller than the tender to link up for intersystem drills. Mounts cannot be used for in-system travel. If the linking ship has been designed to be carried by a tender then establishing this link takes one hour. If not, it takes a full day to fit the ship into the mount. Ships can dismount from the tender with an hour's disentanglement. In an emergency, the carried ships can dismount instantly, but the mountings are considered disabled then until repairs are made. Carried ships cannot fight. ^starship-fittings-shiptender-mount

- ***Smuggler’s hold:*** Carefully-designed storage space intended to conceal illicit cargo from customs inspection. Each installation of this fitting adds 200 kilograms of cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons in a frigate, 20 tons in a cruiser, or 200 tons in a capital ship. Cargo in a smuggler's hold will never be found by a standard customs inspection. Careful investigation by a suspicious official can find it on a difficulty 10 check using their Wis/Notice skill, and a week-long search one step short of disassembly will find it on a difficulty 7 check. ^starship-fittings-smugglers-hold

- ***Survey sensor array:*** Most ships require only basic analysis of a star system, sufficient to identify population centers, do rough scanning of an object's composition, and chart major navigational hazards. Survey sensor arrays greatly enhance the ship's sensor abilities, allowing for finely-detailed mapping of objects and planets, along with broad-spectrum communications analysis. They also improve attempts to detect other craft when scanning a region for stealthy vessels. Any rolls with survey sensor arrays add +2 to skill checks. ^starship-fittings-survey-sensor-array

- ***System drive:*** The ship's standard drive-1 spike drive is removed and replaced with a different propulsion system. The ship is still treated as having a drive-1 for maneuvering and system transit purposes, but it cannot make interstellar drills. This modification lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and adds extra power and space based on the size of the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this amount of free mass is gained by the process. ^starship-fittings-system-drive

- ***Teleportation pads:*** This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was uncommon even on Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen people or 1,200 kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from the surface of a planet or the interior of a another ship, provided it is no more than a few tens of thousands of kilometers distant. Ship-toship teleportation is possible only when the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting accurate coordinate details; otherwise, a friendly, unjammed signal from inside is necessary to lock onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are possible only in the absence of physical barriers between the ship and the target point below. The teleporters may be used once every five minutes. In those rare sectors where this tech is widely available, it costs 200k. ^starship-fittings-teleportation-pads

- ***Tractor beams:*** Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate objects within its immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding objects no larger than a ship of one hull class smaller. Targets with ship-scale propulsion can resist the beams, but lifeboats, individual suit jets, or other smaller propulsors are inadequate. The beam can focus on only one object at a time but can move it into the ship's cargo bays or hurl it out of the ship's immediate vicinity within three rounds. The beams can only effectively manipulate objects in very low gravity, and not those on the surface of planets or other objects with significant natural gravity. ^starship-fittings-tractor-beams

- ***Vehicle transport fittings:*** The ship has been fitted with specialized mounts, bunking, cargo bays, and other facilities to expedite the transport of often-unwieldy vehicles, including mechs and other military craft. Any vehicles carried count as only half their usual cargo tonnage. Assuming trained operators, up to four vehicles can be offloaded or ramped onto the ship per round in cases where speed is critical. ^starship-fittings-vehicle-transport-fittings

- ***Workshops:*** On-board workshops can be bought at smaller than maximum sizes than a hull would allow, if additional TL4 tech facilities aren't strictly needed. A frigate-sized workshop is sufficient for modding any personal gear as per the modification rules here. A cruiser-sized workshop handles vehicle modding and starship maintenance, and a capital-class workshop can build vehicles or similar large work from scratch at full cost. sTarshiP defenses The defenses listed here are some of the more common ones installed in modern TL4 starships. Most non-warships mount little or nothing in the way of special defenses, preferring to save the hull space for cargo and immediately useful fittings. ^starship-fittings-workshops

# Starship Defenses

- ***Ablative Hull Compartments:*** By sacrificing empty hull space in a complex system of ablative blast baffles, a capital-class ship can have a large amount of its total mass shot away without actually impinging on its normal function. This grants it a +1 AC bonus and 20 extra maximum [hit points](#^starship-hit-points). ^starship-defenses-ablative-hull-compartments

- ***Augmented Plating:*** At the cost of a certain amount of speed and maneuverability, a ship can have its armor plating reinforced against glancing hits, gaining a +2 bonus to its AC. This augmentation can decrease a ship's Speed below 0, meaning it will be applied as a penalty to all Pilot tests. ^starship-defenses-augmented-plating

- ***Boarding Countermeasures:*** The ship has hardened bulkheads, reinforced hatches, and specially-designed automated kill corridors for wiping out intruders. Provided that the ship's bridge is still under control, the operator can prevent entry to the ship by any force that lacks shipyard-grade tools, weapons capable of melting hull plating, or specialized military breaching implements. If intruders do get inside, only well-equipped, specially-trained marines have any real chance of breaching the defenses. Ordinary space pirates or more casual invaders have only a 1 in 6 chance of threatening the bridge crew, though they may cause significant damage in their dying. ^starship-defenses-boarding-countermeasures

- ***Burst ECM Generator:*** A high-powered secondary ECM generator can be activated to negate any one otherwise-successful hit against the ship. This generator can be activated after the damage has been rolled, but enemy ships rapidly compensate for the new ECM source, and so the generator can only be used effectively once per engagement. ^starship-defenses-burst-ecm-generator

- ***Foxer Drones:*** These drones are invariably shortlived due to the enormous energy signatures they produce, but until the ship's next turn they grant a +2 AC bonus as their emissions confuse foes. Foxer drones are cheaply constructed and essentially free; the only limit on their number is the amount of free space set aside for holding them. ^starship-defenses-foxer-drones

- ***Grav Eddy Displacer:*** This system links with a ship's navigational subsystem and randomizes the motion vectors in sympathy with metadimensional gravitic currents. This agility gives any hit on the ship a 1 in 6 chance of being negated entirely. ^starship-defenses-grav-eddy-displacer

- ***Hardened Polyceramic Overlay:*** A complex glazing process can harden the surface of a ship's armor to more effectively shed incoming attacks, decreasing the armor-piercing quality of any hit by 5. ^starship-defenses-hardened-polyceramic-overlay

- \* *Credit costs are multiplied by 10 for frigate-class hulls, 25 for cruisers, and 100 for capital-class hulls*
- \# / These costs are multiplied by 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital hulls./

- ***Planetary Defense Array:*** The ship is equipped with an array of gravitic braker guns and an upgraded nuke snuffer field. While useless in conventional ship-to-ship combat, the array can deflect or dampen meteor impacts, dropped penetrator rods, or other non-powered bombardment techniques, and the snuffer field is powerful enough to prevent nuclear fission reactions over a hemisphere-sized area. A single ship with a PDA can protect against any natural meteor strikes and deny easy terror bombardment of a planet's population. The PDA cannot fully protect against orbital strikes by powered penetrators, but it can nudge them off course and make pinpoint strikes impractical. Most developed planets have much more powerful and effective ground installations, but a PDA-equipped ship is a useful emergency stopgap for poor or primitive worlds. ^starship-defenses-planetary-defense-array

- ***Point Defense Lasers:*** Too small to damage ships, these point defense lasers can detonate or melt incoming munitions, improving the ship's defenses against torpedoes, fractal impact charges, and other ammunition-based weapons. ^starship-defenses-point-defense-lasers

# Starship Weaponry

Space is dangerous, and most ships mount the best weapons their purse and their ship's infrastructure can support. While most worlds limit the purchase of warships by civilians, few place restraints on the type of weapons a civilian ship can mount.

Ship weaponry tends to come in two classes. One class of weapon is damaging and has moderate power and mass demands, but has comparatively weak armor-piercing capabilities. Another class of weapon is expensive, taxing to a ship's systems, and may have somewhat inferior damage, but it has enough armor-piercing to affect a warship of a hull size one step larger than the mounting starship.

The choice of which class of weapon to mount usually depends on the type of opposition the designer expects the ship to face. Most civilian ships favor the former kind, as few expect to engage true warships.

## Weapon Qualities

- ***Ammo:*** The weapon or defense requires ammunition to fire. Each round's cost is listed after the weapon's cost, and a number of rounds equal to the weapon's Ammo rating can be fit into one free mass unit. For example, a torpedo launcher can fit the magazine and loading gear for four torpedoes into one free mass unit, and each torpedo will cost 2,500 credits. For each ship class larger than the minimum required to mount the weapon, double the stored ammo per unit. The weapon itself includes one free mass unit worth of ammunition as part of the installation, so simply mounting a torpedo launcher alone on a frigate gives the ship four rounds of ammo. ^weapon-qualities-ammo

- ***AP:*** The weapon ignores this many points of a target's armor. The *Hardened Polyceramic Overlay* defense upgrade may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon's AP rating can do is reduce a target's effective armor to zero. It cannot add additional damage to a hit. ^weapon-qualities-armor-piercing

- ***Cloud:*** The weapon fires an omni-directional wave or spray of projectiles. It automatically targets all fighter-class ships that have attacked the ship within the past round, and the gunner may make one attack roll against each target. Cloud weapons have no effect on ships larger than fighter-class hulls or intruders who are actually on the hull. ^weapon-qualities-cloud

- ***Clumsy:*** Either through a slow discharge time or unwieldy engineering requirements, this weapon suffers -4 to hit small fighter-class hulls. ^weapon-qualities-clumsy

- ***Flak:*** These weapons launch vast numbers of small energy discharges or projectiles, and are particularly dangerous to small ships that rely on speed over thick armor. Against fighter-class hulls, these weapons roll hit rolls and damage rolls twice and take the better result. ^weapon-qualities-flak

## Weapon Descriptions

Each weapon listed below has a cost, the damage die it uses on a hit, and the amount of hardpoints, free power, and mass it takes up in a hull. The minimum hull class required to mount it is also listed, as is the minimum tech level to manufacture it.

All ship weapon attack and damage rolls use the better of the gunner's Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. Most use Shoot as the relevant skill, though Pilot can be used for the guns of a fighter-class ship.

- ***Multifocal Laser:*** Twinned assay and penetration lasers modulate the frequency of this beam for remarkable armor penetration. These weapons are popular choices for fighters intended for frigate or cruiser engagement. ^starship-weaponry-multifocal-laser

- ***Reaper Battery:*** Stepped tapping of the spike drive power plant allows for the emission of a torrent of charged particles. The particles have very little armor penetration, but can fry a small ship's power grid in a strike or two. ^starship-weaponry-reaper-battery

- ***Fractal Impact Charge:*** A spray of penetrator sabots that use fractal surfacing to increase impact. Favored for bomber-class fighter hulls. ^starship-weaponry-fractal-impact-charge

- ***Polyspectral MES Beam:*** A rare example of pretech weaponry, a fighter equipped with a PMB can scratch even a battleship's hull. ^starship-weaponry-polyspectral-mes-beam

- ***Sandthrower:*** Projecting a spray of tiny, dense particulate matter, sandthrowers are highly effective against lightly-armored fighters. ^starship-weaponry-sandthrower

- ***Flak Emitter Battery:*** A baseline frigate anti-fighter system, this battery fires waves of lasers or charged particles to knock down small craft. ^starship-weaponry-flak-emitter-battery

## Ground Weapons vs. Ships

> On rare occasions, PCs will have to deal with small arms fire against their spaceship, or evade ground guns when trying to escape a port or land safely on a hostile world.
>
> As a basic rule of thumb, hostile TL3 small arms fire does no damage, TL4 small arms fire does 1d6 damage per ten minutes of persistent gunfire, and Heavy weapons do half their rolled damage, minus the ship's Armor. Multiple Heavy weapons blazing away at a grounded free merchant can reduce it to unflyable scrap in short order, but a peppering of mag rifle fire is unlikely to do serious damage to a ship that decamps with sufficient speed.
>
> It is impossible to miss a grounded ship. The Armor Class of a ship in flight will vary with the situation; AC 10 for hovering nearby, AC 15 for close-to-earth flight, and AC 20 if the ship is simply flying within weapon range.
>
> Active ground-placed anti-ship defenses are a different matter. These massive lasers and energy projectors are absolutely lethal at atmospheric ranges. Avoiding them is a Pilot skill check at a GM-chosen difficulty of 8 to 10 for each round the ship is exposed, suffering 2d10 damage with AP 20 on each miss. A desperate ship can get outside the gun's firing angle if it can survive three rounds of this peril.

- ***Torpedo Launcher:*** Capable of damaging even a battleship, torpedoes are cumbersome, expensive, and often the core of a line frigate's armament. ^starship-weaponry-torpedo-launcher

- ***Charged Particle Caster:*** A focalized upgrade to the reaper battery, the CPC has a much better armor penetration profile. ^starship-weaponry-charged-particle-caster

- ***Plasma Beam:*** With superior targeting and a smaller energy drain than a CPC, a plasma beam sacrifices some armor penetration. ^starship-weaponry-plasma-beam

- ***Mag Spike Array:*** A storm of magnetically-accelerated spike charges is almost guaranteed to eradicate any fighter-class craft it hits. ^starship-weaponry-mag-spike-array

- ***Nuclear Missiles:*** Useless in ship-to-ship combat or against any other TL4 planet with working nuke snuffers, one of these missiles can still erase an entire lostworlder city without such protection. ^starship-weaponry-nuclear-missiles

- ***Spinal Beam Cannon:*** One of the first spinal-mount class weapons, the SBC briefly channels the full power of the ship into a charged beam. It lacks the power and penetration of the more advanced gravcannon, but also takes less power to mount. ^starship-weaponry-spinal-beam-cannon

- ***Smart Cloud:*** A swarm of self-directed microdrones sweeps over the ship. Their integral beam weaponry is too small to damage larger ships, but they can wipe out an attacking fighter wave. ^starship-weaponry-smart-cloud

- ***Gravcannon:*** Using much the same principles as man-portable grav weaponry, the gravcannon causes targets to fall apart in a welter of mutually-antagonistic gravitic fields. ^starship-weaponry-gravcannon

- ***Spike Inversion Projector:*** The SIP uses the ship's spike phasing as an offensive weapon, penetrating the target with a brief incursion of MES energies that largely ignore attempts to evade. ^starship-weaponry-spike-inversion-projector

- ***Vortex Tunnel Inductor:*** A capital-class model of the SIP, a VTI is capable of incapacitating a cruiser in two hits. Its bulk limits its utility against fighter-class craft, however. ^starship-weaponry-vortex-tunnel-inductor

- ***Mass Cannon:*** By firing projectiles almost as large as fighter-scale craft, the mass cannon inflicts tremendous damage on a target. Serious ammunition limitations hamper its wider-scale use. ^starship-weaponry-mass-cannon

- ***Lightning Charge Mantle:*** Modulation of the ship's power core emits a cloak of MES lightning. While larger spike drive craft can shunt the energies away harmlessly, fighter-class ships are almost invariably destroyed if hit. ^starship-weaponry-lightning-charge-mantle

- ***Singularity Gun:*** One of the few surviving pretech weapons in anything resembling wide currency, this capital-class weapons system fires something mathematically related to a miniaturized black hole at a target. ^starship-weaponry-singularity-gun

## Example Starships

Below are the final statistics for some of the more common starship models in post-Silence human space. Each entry includes the default NPC crew skill modifier and the normal number of Command Points each one gets each round under NPC crews. ^starship-npc-crew-skill-modifier

Costs are listed for the ship itself, for its six month maintenance, and for the yearly employment of its standard crew complement. PCs naturally need not draw this pay, though they'll still need to lay out 20 credits a day per head for food and other basic supplies.

The standard drill-capable fighter craft of most TL4 polities, this model retains a spike drive instead of replacing it with a cheaper systems drive. While the lone pilot would have to be desperate and heavily drugged to make an entire spike drill solo, it remains an option when no larger craft is available.

This particular model is equipped with a reaper battery for dealing with small, lightly-armored civilian ships. “Bomber”-type fighters usually replace this with a fractal impact charge to threaten larger warships, while fighters built to dogfight their peers favor fitting a multifocal laser.

This craft is a conventional civilian shuttle, albeit one with a spike drive sufficient to get it to a neighboring system and enough passenger space to make it a minimally-acceptable transport for brave VIPs and light cargo. If used as an inter-system transport, however, at least three crew will be needed to safely navigate a drill.

While cheap and flexible, the shuttle is entirely unarmed and acutely vulnerable to piracy or hostile warships. In such cases the pilot's only recourse is to surrender or hope the small craft's nimble maneuver drives can keep it away from the attacker long enough to get to safety.

A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the standard free merchant A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the standard free merchant is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling significant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while requiring very few hands to operate it. Only one crew member is needed for in-system flight, though spike drills require three for normal margins of safety.

The standard free merchant is not a warship, but its sandthrower is enough to discourage pirate shuttles and the other small or fragile craft that wreckers or primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser is ideal for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out important systems on an attacking vessel, but the ship lacks the armor and durability to stand up to a true warship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a corvette might be threatened by the wellaimed guns of a small craft like this.

Patrol boats are often the largest ships fielded by poor or backward frontier worlds that lack the shipyard facilities or available resources to build bigger military craft. Even so, the ability to field two patrol boats for the yearly maintenance cost of one corvette often appeals even to richer worlds that need more coverage than their available craft can provide.

Patrol boats are the smallest independent warships fielded by most navies, as fighters are not normally considered capable of extended independent operation.

They have considerable spike drive reach and are faster in-system than most of their potential targets. While their single mounted gun is vulnerable to being disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively thick armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can mitigate that danger. A few patrol boats replace their survey sensor array with a sandthrower to up-gun the ship, but most prefer the additional edge in scanning potential smugglers.

The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded frontier navies, a corvette is a true warship, albeit of a minimal size. While it is unable to land on worlds with standard gravity, its cargo lighter allows crew and cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its extended stores allow for more than four months of field operation under normal crew parameters.

Most pirates flying reworked free merchants or stolen patrol boats will turn tail as soon as a corvette shows up in the region. Good armor, multiple ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make a corvette a death sentence to most stellar ruffians, and even when a pirate wolf pack can bring one down, it usually comes at the cost of crippling damage.

The model depicted here is standard for anti-piracy and basic system defense missions. Against cruiser-class warships, however, this corvette's weapons have insufficient armor penetration to seriously threaten such a major warship.

Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavy frigate pushes the engineering parameters of a frigate hull to the maximum available to most TL4 worlds. Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate can intimidate any ship of its weight class. Its heavy crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots throughout a solar system.

However, despite the large weapon loadout, the heavy frigate remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true cruiser-class warship, and most frigates built for same-class engagements can be a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a bludgeon against the other small warships likely to be fielded by a peer star-faring polity.

Found only in rich, peaceful regions of space, the bulk freighter is capable of hauling thousands of tons of goods between star systems. While it's equipped with enough of a sting to discourage small-ship piracy, it's woefully inadequate to handle a warship, or even an up-gunned free merchant.

Some adventurers do find use for a bulk freighter hull, however, trading off some of its massive cargo space for more fittings and using customized modifications to allow the ship to support heavier power demands. While the end result is no match for a true cruiser, the sheer mass of the freighter can make it a dangerous opponent in the right hands.

The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the fleet cruiser is a ship-eating monster compared to its smaller brethren in the navy. Only prosperous polities can build such powerful ships, and even they sometimes find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of small craft rather than a few heavily-armed cruisers.

The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily-armored hull. Only special hunter-killer ships fitted with armor-piercing weaponry have any real chance of penetrating the cruiser's thick skin. Those weapons are almost always more bulky and power-hungry than their peer weapons, so enemy polities must usually choose between building small ships that are very effective at defeating other small ships, or building hunter-killers that can threaten cruisers but are at a disadvantage against their less specialized brethren.

Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can create, only the richest modern worlds can afford to fabricate these massive engines of war. Even those worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at expending such a tremendous amount of money on a single ship.

Those that do build battleships do so for a reason. The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require hunter-killer *cruisers* to disable them.

The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it is only a single ship&hellip; a single, *extremely expensive* ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time, and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it.

The queen of every navy that has one, a carrier is the pinnacle of TL4 shipbuilding technology and a massive credit sink for any polity rich or desperate enough to build one. Every fully-equipped carrier holds more firepower than most modern navies can assemble, and a single carrier is more than enough to crush most TL4 naval task forces.

The carrier itself is only the vector for its tremendous payload of ships, both small fighters and corvette-type daughter craft. The ability to quickly alter the flight wings of a carrier allows a rich planet to tailor its loadout to the specific needs of a campaign, whether it's destroying the interstellar commerce and asteroid mines of an enemy polity or going head-to-head against their cruiser line of battle. Many polities further optimize their carrier-loaded ships by removing their spike drives and replacing them with system drives, relying on the carrier to get them into position. Of course, if the mothership is destroyed in hostile territory, these orphans are doomed.

While a carrier has a belly full of death, the ship itself is lightly gunned and has significantly weaker armor than its battleship brethren. Any polity rich enough to build a carrier knows well enough to equip it with an escort of other ships to screen it from hostile attentions. Lightly-armed as it is, a wing of fighter-bombers can leave it a burning hulk if it's caught out without protection.

# Building a Ship

> A fortunate adventurer has won the favor of a powerful shipping magnate, and has earned one million credits worth of astronautic work. The player thinks it's an excellent chance to have a ship built to fit the adventuring party's needs.
>
> She starts by looking over the ship hulls and quickly sees that a free merchant hull is the best she can afford. A shuttle hull might work, but such a ship is too fragile for her liking. The hull itself costs 500,000 credits and comes with a drive-1 spike drive.
>
> It also has free Power and Mass scores of 10 and 15 respectively. The player can fill that space with fittings and defenses as she wishes.
>
> First, she looks at weaponry. She wants enough firepower to discourage small ships, but she can't mount weapons that require a cruiser or capital hull, and a plasma beam is far too expensive. She could settle for a multifocal laser, which is cheap, but she decides to up-gun to a fractal impact charge, trusting in the party's Warrior to aim it well. It costs 200k credits, 5 power, 1 mass, and 1 free hardpoint. It can store up to 8 charges in the launcher since a frigate-class hull is one larger than the minimum needed to mount it. The charges themselves will cost her another 4,000 credits.
>
> Next, she thinks about better engines. She briefly considers a drive-3 upgrade, but it would take 4 points of Power and Mass, leaving her almost no Power left for other fittings. She settles for a drive-2 upgrade for 100k credits, 2 Power, and 2 Mass.
>
> She takes a moment to think about adding some hardened polyceramic overlay to the merchant as a defense, but the ship's Armor is so low that it doesn't seem worth the effort to harden it.
>
> The PCs will need to land, so she adds an atmospheric configuration at 50k and 2 Mass. She wants fuel scoops so she doesn't have to trust to local refueling stations, so that's 50k, 2 Power, and 2 Mass. Prudence recommends a fuel bunker in case she needs to drill out before refueling, adding 25k and 1 Mass.
>
> She's so far spent 929,000 credits, 9 Power, and 8 Mass. To spare bookkeeping, she puts in a ship's locker for 25k, but an armory is too expensive; the PCs will just have to track their own weapons and ammo. The remaining Mass is turned into 140 tons of cargo space. Thus, the final ship costs 954,000 credits and uses 9 Power, and 15 Mass. At a rate of 25,000 credits of shipyard work a day, it'll take the yards about 39 days to build, giving the party time to think about how they'll pay for maintenance&hellip;

## Modifying and Tuning Starships

Most ships are maintained in the condition they came from the shipyard, with the crew and the engineers working to keep things aligned with the shipwright's specifications. Such rigid conformity with standard techniques ensures easy repair, cheap maintenance, and the ready ability to switch crews without requiring laborious retraining or familiarization. Not all engineers value these qualities so highly, however, and some prefer to install their own improvements.

A ship's engineer can alter the wiring, internal structure, or other specifications of a starship, either to improve overall performance or make tradeoffs that are useful to their needs. Making these modifications isn't cheap, and they often require the strategic deployment of rare pretech ship components.

Engineers with sufficiently vast resources, shipyard access, and available pretech components can completely re-engineer a ship to integrate their improvements in the basic hull structure. These improvements no longer require their special attention to keep them operational, allowing the engineer to focus on other modifications or allow less talented crewmen to keep the ship in fighting trim.

## Mods and Maintenance

Every engineer has a Maintenance score, the same used for installing equipment mods as described here. The score is equal to their Intelligence modifier plus their Constitution modifier plus three times their Fix score. Any mod maintenance is counted against this Maintenance score, whether for equipment or starships.

An engineer can maintain a number of mods at once equal to their Maintenance score. If a ship mod is neglected for one week of active use, it breaks down. Any fittings or functions dependent on the mod also become inoperable until a sufficiently skilled engineer spends at least 8 hours repairing the mod, a process which requires time but no significant additional parts. Ships parked at a station or landing strip don't count as “active” for this purpose, so the ship's engineer can go off for a week's adventure or shore leave without returning to a broken-down starship.

More than one engineer can work to maintain a ship's modifications, provided the maintenance officer has a Fix skill score as high as that needed to install the mod in the first place. This also assumes that the chief engineer and any assistants work together closely to properly teach the structure and quirks of the modification. The difficulty of maintaining this close teamwork and sourcing exotic parts to maintain a non-standard modification is one reason why very few NPC ships have mods. While they're possible for elite craft and idiosyncratic prototypes, most military ships or corporate traders have too much of a logistical burden to support these odd alterations.

## Installing Mods

Every starship mod requires a certain amount of refitting work and after-market parts, along with a potential need for one or more pretech components. These pretech components are not normally for sale, and are usually found only through salvage during adventuring or as rewards for favors performed for important personages. While they vary in structure and appearance, for convenience's sake it's assumed that a given component can serve in installing any mod.

Building the mod can be done at a rate of one day's work for the crew per 5,000 credits in mod cost, or one day per 25,000 credits if a shipyard's services are available. Mods can also be torn out, a process taking less than a day that reclaims any pretech components used in their construction but wastes any credit investment in parts.

Mod installation does not require a full shipyard, but it does assume the full crew of the ship is assisting the engineer in stripping components, welding in new fittings, and hauling heavy parts. A lone engineer can't make mods to anything larger than a frigate-class hull, and that might take a week's painstaking labor for every 5,000 credits of cost.

## Redesigning Ships

An engineer with vast amounts of money, components, and shipyard support can completely rebuild a ship hull to include a mod as part of its basic structure, or redesign an existing hull schematic to include the mod. This is much more expensive than a quick after-market addition, but the mod becomes part of the basic ship itself and requires no further Maintenance.

To rebuild a ship with a mod, the engineer must spend five times the usual cost in credits and twice as many pretech components as usually required by the mod. A shipyard is mandatory for such extensive redesign, and can do the work at a rate of 25,000 credits worth each day.

To build an entirely new hull that includes the mod as part of its design, only the normal price of the mod must be paid in credits and components. By integrating the modification into the ship's basic blueprints, the engineer makes it much easier to install and maintain it. Of course, the entire hull must then be built from scratch at a shipyard, also at the usual rate of 25,000 credits of work done per day.

There's a limit to the amount of flexibility an engineer has in such designs, however. A ship can only be rebuilt or redesigned with a number of mods equal to twice the engineer's Fix skill score. Further mods can be bolted on afterwards, but these will require Maintenance to keep in operating order, just as with any other mod.

## Example Starship Mods

The following modifications aren't the only alterations that a canny engineer can install on a starship, but they're among the most common. Each one is listed with the minimum Fix skill required to install or maintain the mod.

The credit price for most is expressed in a percent of the base hull cost; thus, to install a power trunk streamlining mod with a 10% cost in a free merchant hull would cost 50,000 credits, or 10% the cost of the base hull. In a battleship hull, that same mod would cost 6,000,000 credits.

The pretech component cost is given in components per hull class. Thus, if a mod requires one component per hull class, it would take one component for a fighter-class hull, two for a frigate, three for a cruiser, and four for a capital-class hull. These pretech components are usually rare and restricted enough that they cannot be purchased on the open market. PCs need to find them during their adventures, acquire them through favors to powerful persons, or intentionally seek them out in salvage adventures.

Most mods can be installed only once, though a few of them labeled otherwise can be duplicated as far as the ship's infrastructure can support them.

- ***Cargo Efficiency Bays (Fix-1):*** The ship's internal structure is adjusted to optimize available cargo space. The ship's total free Mass is decreased by 10%, rounded up, but, each point of Mass dedicated to cargo space counts as two points. Cost: 10% of hull, 1 component/hull class ^starship-mods-cargo-efficiency-bays

- ***Compact Magazines (Fix-1):*** The ship can carry twice as much ammunition as its available weapons and magazine space would normally allow. Cost: 5% of hull, no components ^starship-mods-compact-magazines

- ***Drill Velocity Upgrade (Fix-2):*** The ship's spike drive is counted as one level better when determining spike drill transit speed and maximum drill range, up to a maximum of drive-6. Cost: 10% of hull, 1 component/hull class ^starship-mods-drill-velocity-upgrade

- ***Emergency Drill Activation (Fix-3):*** The ship can engage its spike drives even when in dangerous proximity to a planetary body. When engaged, it can drill out in a single round. Doing so increases the difficulty of any spike drive skill check by +2 if in-system or +4 if actually landed. Drilling out from the surface will destroy everything within 200 meters of the ship. The mod can be used only once every four weeks. Cost: 20% hull, 2 components/hull class ^starship-mods-emergency-drill-activation

- ***Emergency Thruster Boost (Fix-1):*** Retune the engines for emergency power. Once per space combat, gain a +2 bonus to Speed for three rounds. Cost: 10% of hull, no components ^starship-mods-emergency-thruster-boost

- ***Engine Optimization (Fix-2):*** The engines have been optimized for realspace maneuverability. The ship's Speed increases by 1. Cost: 10% of hull, 1 component/hull class ^starship-mods-engine-optimization

- ***Eternal Reactor (Fix-2):*** The ship's fuel tanks are replaced with effectively everlasting pretech energy cores. It no longer needs to refuel for drills or operation. Cost: 5% of hull, 2 components/hull class ^starship-mods-eternal-reactor

- ***Extended Mass Support (Fix-1):*** The engineer trims back the power core to allow for more ship mass. Lose up to ten points of free Power; gain half as many points of free Mass, rounded down. This mod can be installed multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one component ^starship-mods--extended-mass-support

- ***Low Emissions (Fix-1):*** Any sensor checks to detect the ship have their difficulty increased by +2. Cost: 10% of hull, 1 component/hull class ^starship-mods-low-emissions

- ***Nemesis Tracker (Fix-3):*** The ship's targeting computers are augmented with pretech prediction software. Once per ship combat, a gunner on the ship can take an Instant action to cause a weapon shot to hit, regardless of the hit roll. Cost: 5% of hull, 2 components/hull class ^starship-mods-nemesis-tracker

- ***Oversized Mountings (Fix-2):*** Choose a specific weapon or fitting that normally requires a hull size one step larger than the ship the mod is installed on. The ship can mount that fitting. Cost: 15% of hull, 1 component/hull size ^starship-mods-oversized-mountings

- ***Power Trunk Streamlining (Fix-1):*** Sacrifice free hull space for superior power core efficiency. Lose up to five points of free Mass; gain twice as many points of free Power. This mod can be installed multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one component ^starship-mods-power-trunk-streamlining

- ***Q-Ship Cladding (Fix-1):*** Some or all of ship's weapons are concealed from external observation and standard scans when they are not deployed for combat. The ship itself can be made to look like a merchant or freighter of its size class. Cost: 5% of hull, no components ^starship-mods-q-ship-cladding

- ***Regenerative Armor (Fix-3):*** The ship's Armor score increases by 5 points. Cost: 15% of hull, 2 components/hull class ^starship-mods-regenerative-armor

- ***Reinforced Armor (Fix-1):*** The ship's Armor score increases by the Fix skill of the installing engineer. The ship loses one point of Power and one point of Mass. Cost: 5% of hull ^starship-mods-reinforced-armor

- ***Specialized Mountings (Fix-1):*** Choose a specific weapon or fitting when this mod is installed. The chosen fitting requires only half the normal Power and Mass per fitting installation, rounded down to a minimum of 1. Cost: 10% of hull, no components ^starship-mods-specialized-mountings

- ***Volley Capacitors (Fix-2):*** The ship's weaponry has been altered for rapid firing. Once per combat, the ship's gunner gets 4 Command Points that must be spent on gunnery actions. Cost: 10% of hull, no components ^starship-mods-volley-capacitors

- ***Weapon Overcharge (Fix-2):*** One weapon of the engineer's choice has been overcharged. It requires 50% more Power than a usual installation, but rolls its damage twice and takes the better result each time. This mod may be installed more than once. Cost: 5% of hull, no components ^starship-mods-weapon-overcharge

# Space Travel

Interstellar travel takes place through metadimensional space, a higher-order continuum “understood” by only a handful of brilliant researchers and astronautic engineers. Fortunately, it is not necessary to have an intuitive understanding of the place in order to operate a spike drive starship. While modern postech spike drives are neither as powerful nor as efficient as the exquisite creations of the Terran Mandate, most TL4 worlds can still put together the necessary components to get a ship from one stellar system to another.

Within the gravity well created by a stellar body, a spike drive provides sub-light propulsion sufficient to get the ship to most system locations within a few days at most. Only at the edge of a solar system, where the gravitic influence of the star dwindles away to almost nothing, can the spike drive be fully engaged to catapult the ship into metadimensional space. This gravitic transition zone is critical for providing the necessary step-up and step-down for a spike drive. Without such a transition, a ship can neither climb into metadimensional space nor come down from those elevated dimensional frequencies. Only a star is sufficient to provide enough of a gravitic gradient; random interstellar rocks and debris don't exert enough of an influence to form a usable transition zone.

Ships are generally unable to “overshoot” a transition zone. If a ship is coming into a system from a spike drive course to the stellar northwest of the star, it will appear at the northwest edge of the solar system. Its pilot can't choose to “overshoot” that region, traveling across the solar system to come down on the southeastern edge of the star's transition zone. This property allows a solar system's owner to fortify probable transit paths into the system, placing defenses and picket ships in the path of likely arrivals.

This can be a difficult and expensive process if the star is in a crowded stellar neighborhood. The transit paths from each potential destination are different; if a star has two other systems to its east, it has to fortify two different arrival zones if it wants to be confident of detecting incoming ships from both stars. If an exceptionally powerful spike drive allows an intruder to drill in from a more-distant star, the local polity might have no local sensors at all in the region, having never anticipated that a ship might come directly from such a distant location.

These relatively-fixed arrival zones only apply to ships arriving at a star. A ship can *leave* from any location on the rim, traveling toward any destination within reach of its spike drive. Thus, a ship that's able to skulk past a system's frontier sensors can usually find an empty region of space in the transition zone to skip out undetected. It also has no obligation to be on the “correct side” of the star to go leaping off toward a particular stellar destination.

## Making Spike Drills

Interstellar spike drills are dangerous. Some sectors have the technology and friendly-enough metadimensional weather to make standard drill paths relatively safe for travel. Ships in these favored sectors can move between connected worlds with no significant chance of disaster. Other sectors are not so fortunate, nor are those ships that must forge through uncharted metadimensional space to reach their destination. Careless navigation or sheer bad luck can result in these ships being snuffed out by an unexpected surge of metadimensional energy or lost in the storms of hyperdimensional space.

To make a successful spike drill, the target system must be within range. A spike drive has a hex range equal to its rating; a drive-3 can reach a star three hexes away on the sector map. Note that these sector maps are abstractions rather than strict 2D maps. A star three hexes away might be a vast distance away, but connected by a friendly stretch of metadimensional space. Conversely, an “empty” adjacent hex might have a star in it, but it's surrounded by killing waves of impenetrable dimensional disruption. Because of this, conventional astronomical mapping isn't overly useful to transit. The astronomers might know that there's a star only a few light years away, but if the navigators can't find a metadimensional path to it, it might as well be on the far side of the galaxy. ^spike-drive-rating

A spike drill requires one load of fuel. Most ships can hold a single load of fuel at any one time. All can be refueled from the appropriate refineries or starport tending services, while others can use fuel scoop fittings to refuel from a star or gas giant. Other ships have fuel bunkers that can hold more than one load of fuel, for quick double-drills when speed is vital. Normal intra-system maneuvering uses no significant amount of fuel, and refueling costs a flat 500 credits per load.

A spike drill requires time. A safe drill procedure requires half an hour to enter metadimensional space, though this process can be rushed at greater risk. The transit time is six days per hex traveled, divided by the spike drill rating. Thus, a drive-3 crossing two hexes would take four days, while a drive-1 moving to an adjacent hex would take six days. Daring navigators can “trim the course”, accepting greater risks in transit in order to increase their effective drive rating by 1 for purposes of determining the speed of travel, though this bonus doesn't increase the drive's maximum range.

A spike drill needs a course record, or “rutter” to guide the pilot. Ideally, this is an up-to-date and recent record of the metadimensional currents and energetic weather between the origin and destination of their course, one reported by a recent traveler. The older and staler the readings of the rutter, the more dangerous the drill. Most rutters for commonly-traveled routes are freely available, and significant trade corridors usually have ones only a few days old available to any pilot making the drill.

Rutters charting heretofore-unknown paths between stars are often kept jealously secret by their owners, and may require an adventure or a favor to obtain.

Attempting to drill to a star without any rutter at all is insanely dangerous, the work of near-suicidal crew of adventurers willing to risk everything in order to obtain a secret route to some hopefully-unplundered world. Only a masterful interstellar navigator has any real hope of surviving such a blind drill.

Finally, a spike drill needs a pilot. Only a human or other sentient-grade intellect is capable of dealing with the dangerously unpredictable perils of metadimensional space, as expert systems and other “dumb” robots simply can't handle the random dangers. Most ships require at least three crew members to cover all the bridge watches necessary, though only one of these crew needs to be an actual pilot. In desperate circumstances, a lone pilot can use drugs to stay awake for as much as a week in order to single-handedly steer a ship to its destination.

If all these ingredients are in place and the ship is at the edge of the solar system, a ship's navigator can make an Int/Pilot skill check to make a successful spike drill, the process taking 30 minutes. If rushed, it takes only one ship combat round to execute. The base difficulty is 7, modified by the available rutter, the distance drilled, rushed procedures, and whether or not the navigator is trimming the course to speed up the transit. If the final difficulty is 6 or less, the drill is too safe and simple to have any risk of failure.

### Table - Spike Drill Modifiers

| Spike Drills                           | Mod |
|:-------------------------------------- |:---:|
| Base difficulty for a spike drill      |  7  |
| The course is totally uncharted        | +6  |
| The rutter's more than 5 years old     | +2  |
| The rutter's from 1 to 5 years old     | +1  |
| The rutter's less than a year old      | +0  |
| The rutter's less than a month old     | -2  |
| The drill's distance, per 2 full hexes | +1  |
| Trimming the course                    | +2  |
| The drill activation was rushed        | +2  |

If the roll fails, something has gone wrong on the drill, and a roll on the failed navigation results are necessary. These mishaps don't normally result in the summary death of the crew, but they often force the navigator to make emergency course changes or drill exits that might leave the ship in a dangerously unfriendly region of space.

## Intra-System Travel

Traveling inside a solar system is much safer and more rapid than interstellar travel. Barring unusual perils or mechanical failure, such journeys can be made without Pilot skill checks or risk of dramatic mishaps.

For convenience, space within a solar system is broken up in ***regions***. Each region is simply a place of interest within the system; planets are regions, fortified arrival zones are regions, particular pirate lairs in the asteroid belts are regions, and so forth. Any particular place of interest and its satellite areas can be treated as a single region.

The base travel time for moving inside a region is six hours. Thus, in six hours a ship could travel from a planetary starport to a site on the planet's moon, or to a distant science station orbiting around the planet, or to a distress beacon in space near that world. Any place within that region can be reached within six hours, or faster at the GM's discretion.

The base travel time for moving between regions is forty-eight hours. A ship in orbit around one planet could thus travel to an entirely different planet, or to the transition zone at the rim of the system, or to a ship detected deep within system space, or to an asteroid pirate base, or to any other point of interest in the solar system.

Base travel time is divided by the ship's spike drive rating. Thus, a ship with drive-3 could reach another region in the system in only 16 hours. Bold navigators can “trim the course” to increase their effective spike drive rating by 1 by making a successful Pilot check at difficulty 9. On a failure, the travel actually takes twice as long as usual.

# Sensors and Detection

Adventurers often find it necessary to be very discreet about their comings and goings within a solar system, as do pirates, hostile warships, smugglers, and other nefarious sorts. Space is wide and dark, and if a ship is careful to avoid inhabited regions it can often escape notice by a system's inhabitants.

## Hiding and Seeking

As a general matter it is very difficult to spot a ship in deep space when it doesn't wish to be spotted. Once a ship's energy signature is identified, however, it becomes much easier to follow the ship's movement; such a positional fix is called a ***detection lock***, and once a ship has been locked by an observer it can be tracked at any distance in the system. ^detection-locks

Fixing a lock on a target requires the observer to be in the same region of space and to win an opposed Int/Program skill check against the ship's comms officer. If the observer wins the opposed roll, they get a detection lock on the ship. If they lose or tie, they remain oblivious to the ship's presence and can try again in 24 hours. The active sensors used to form a detection lock can be detected by the target; they know they've been made. If the observing ship uses passive sensors, the lock is undetectable, but it's more difficult to obtain.

The observer takes bonuses and penalties to their opposed skill check based on the circumstances as listed below. This can alter their die roll substantially, and make concealment almost impossible for ships not specially equipped for stealth. The modifiers below are common ones, but particular regions of space may have their own hazards or complications, with some making detection so difficult that they become favorite lairs for pirates and malcontents.

### Table - Modifiers to Obtaining Detection Locks

| Observer is&hellip; | Mod | Target Ship is&hellip;                | Mod |
| ------------------- |:---:| ------------------------------------- |:---:|
| Fighter             | +0  | Fighter                               | +3  |
| Frigate             | +1  | Frigate                               | +2  |
| Cruiser             | +2  | Cruiser                               | +1  |
| Capital             | +3  | Capital                               | +0  |
| Minor Outpost       | +2  | Station                               | -2  |
| Major Station       | +4  | Avoiding planetary population centers | +2  |
| Planet              | +5  |                                       |     |
| Passive sensors     | -2  |                                       |     |



The larger the ship, the better the sensors it will have, but the easier it is to spot it in space. Minor outposts would reflect small deep-space habs or listening posts, while major space stations would include most military stations and other significant fortifications. Ships that carefully avoid population centers when landing on a world can mitigate some of the danger of a planetary sensor network, leaving smugglers and pirates to prefer landing in remote, little-inhabited areas.

To break a lock, a tracked ship needs to leave the region. As soon as it does, the observer and the ship repeat their opposed skill check. If the observer wins, it continues to track the ship, while a tie or loss means the ship slips the lock. Any observers in the destination region can attempt to pick up the ship immediately and then once every 24 hours, but the original observer is out of luck. Provided a ship is willing to escape to the region of deep space above or below the solar ecliptic, it's extremely unlikely that there'll be anything there to spot them. Of course, such escape also means staying clear of potential refuges. A ship that flees to the “edge of the system” region can drill out to safety from there, and unless they pick a chunk of the rim monitored by the locals, they can do so with impunity. Very few worlds can monitor the entire system perimeter.

When rolling for observation, only roll once for any given group, outpost, or planet, using the best modifiers available. Thus, if a battle squadron including a cruiser and three frigates rolls to observe, the GM would use the skill bonus and +2 modifier for the cruiser's crew. If a separate pirate ship was in the same region, the GM would roll for them as well, because they're a separate force in the region.

## Pursuit and Escape

Adventurers have a habit of drawing unfriendly attention from hostile ships. While escape from a combat engagement is a matter of maneuver jets and good piloting, long-range chases rely more on a ship's spike drives to provide raw motive power.

A pursuer must be in the same region of space to pursue and must have a detection lock. Of course, if the pursued lacks a detection lock on the pursuer, they'll have no idea that they're being chased.

Both ships make Int/Pilot opposed skill checks, each adding their spike drive rating to the roll. If the pursuer wins or ties, they force an engagement and the ships are moved into combat range. If the pursued ship wins, it gets six hours of distance, modified by any difference in spike drive ratings; a drive-1 ship being chased by a drive-2 ship would have three hours, for example. It can use this time to reach a particular point inside the region, or can put it toward an attempt to escape the region entirely. Ships with spike drive-1 engines need 48 hours to enter a new region, so they are unlikely to avoid a determined pursuer; one with spike drive-3, on the other hand, can make the escape in only 16 hours. Some pilots may attempt to speed this up by trimming their course.

A pursuing ship can also use this six hours to aim toward a different region, if it thinks it knows where the ship is running. Assuming they can keep the detection lock when the pursued ship slips over the sub-stellar border, they can end up close on their prey's heels.

## Scanning Planets and Ships

Short-range scans of ships and planetary objects are relatively simple affairs. Any scan of a ship within combat range will reveal the ship's hull type, obvious weaponry and damage, and registered ID code. A scan of a planet in orbit will always reveal basic information on atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, other ships in orbit, and any surface features designed to attract orbital interest.

Comms officers can attempt to interrogate the scans, asking one question before rolling an Int/ Program skill check against difficulty 8. On a success, the question is answered, while a failure means that the data is inconclusive and no further questions can be asked of it that day. Each question after the first success that same day is asked at a cumulative +1 difficulty modifier. Questions should be simple and direct.

When scanning a ship, a comms officer might ask whether particular fittings or weapons have been mounted, where good boarding points might be on the hull, whether the ship looks to be the product of a particular world or culture, or simply to question whether anything looks odd about the ship's readings. The sensors can probe a meter or so beneath the hull skin, but they can't intrude on a ship's computer network or provide a map of interior spaces.

When scanning a planet, a comms officer can ask about apparent capitals or spaceports, major industrial sites, unusual planetary weather patterns, unique allergens or atmospheric hazards, current local news transmissions, or identify hidden or low-tech communities that are large but do not have clear energy signatures.

If they have the *Survey Sensor Array* fitting, they can do orbital visual spying accurate enough to read newsprint, in addition to asking questions about subterranean spaces, visible surface life forms of interest, crude maps of the interior spaces, and interesting energy readings.

# Maintenance and Repair

Ships are expensive things to keep flying, and many adventuring crews find themselves taking somewhat dubious work just to get enough money to keep their ship in the air.

## Spares, Repairs and Refueling

Most ships have their repairs and maintenance done at a shipyard, but a ship can perform field maintenance and repair if they have the necessary parts. One ton of cargo space can hold 10,000 credits worth of spare parts. Any time required is quadrupled, however.

Ship fuel costs a flat 500 credits per load.

## Six-Month Maintenance

Every ship needs to spend 5% of its total non-crew cost every six months in order to pay for basic maintenance. Each such period that is skipped applies a -1 penalty to all ship skill checks and hit rolls. At -4, the ship gains a 10% chance per month of breaking down entirely until backlogged maintenance is repaired. At a shipyard, this maintenance takes a day for a fighter hull, a week for a frigate or cruiser, and a month for a capital ship.

## Repairing Hulls and Systems

Fixing ship [hit points](#^starship-hit-points) can be done at a cost of 1,000 credits per point, with up to the presiding engineer's Fix skill repaired in points each day. A disabled system can be jury-rigged back to functionality for one-tenth the system's cost and one day's work per 25,000 credits so spent. A jury-rigged system that is disabled again is destroyed. Full repairs of a disabled system cost one-quarter of its original price.

Repairs made during combat do not need to be re-done or paid for afterwards, as they were performed before the damage could become critical and lasting.

## Sneaking In

> The free merchant *Grendel* has just drilled into a new system using charts her captain stole from an unfortunate pirate.
>
> As it happens, a small pirate base is positioned in the region, placed there by its inhabitants to keep an eye on any traffic from the adjacent system. They get a chance to detect the *Grendel*, and roll the pirate comm officer's skill bonus of +2 plus another +2 for being a minor outpost, and a -2 for using passive sensors to avoid alerting targets. Their total is 12. The *Grendel*'s comms officer is good, however, and gets a +2 for being a frigate-class ship. His Int/ Program skill roll is a 13, meaning the base has not detected the ship.
>
> Now the free merchant gets a chance to spot the station, also using passive sensors at a -2 penalty. The outpost is a very visible space station, and takes -2 on its opposed roll, while the frigate gains a +1 on its check. The base rolls a 7 and the *Grendel* rolls an 8. The frigate has a detection lock on the pirate base.
>
> Her captain decides to sneak further into the system. She can't be sure the station hasn't spotted her, but it's made no obvious sign of it and she wants to investigate the local planets and their inhabitants. The *Grendel*'s drive-2 engine can cross over to a planet's region with 24 hours of travel.
>
> This will give the station one more chance to lock the ship, since it can try again in 24 hours. Even if it does successfully lock the free merchant, however, the captain bets they can lose it when they transfer out of the solar region. The pirate base might broadcast an alert to any other local allies, however, which could make things awkward.

## Space Combat

The clash of ships in the void, the flash of silent explosions and soundless death&hellip; these things are familiar to interstellar adventurers, and a natural hazard of the profession. While most adventurers seek to avoid such hull-melting conflagrations of war, sometimes the choice is not their own. When two or more ships close to combat range with the intent to kill, it's time to fight.

## The Combat Round

Space combat begins with a normal initiative roll, one made by each ship involved in the combat. Each rolls 1d8 modified by the Intelligence or Dexterity modifier of the pilot, and they take their turns in order, with PCs winning ties. Once every ship has had a turn, the round starts over from the top. Initiative is not rerolled. A round of ship combat takes about 15 minutes, but Experts and Warriors can only use their special class abilities to reroll skill checks or ensure automatic hits once per engagement.

On its turn, a ship's captain decides in which order its various departments will act: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. Each department then chooses actions, choosing either from their specific department or a general action available to all departments. A department head can choose actions from only one category; they can't pick from both. Some of these actions generate ***Command Points***, allowing other departments to spend these points taking actions that require them. When all departments have acted, the next ship in order can go.

If the ship is an NPC ship, the GM can abbreviate the process, giving it a fixed number of Command Points based on its general crew quality, with the ship being able to take whatever actions it needs using that total. Fighters and civilian ships usually have 4 Command Points, military or pirate ships have 5, native spacers and highly-trained warships have 6, and the finest NPC crews in space can muster 7 points.

## Ship Departments

For purposes of interstellar combat, every ship is assumed to have five departments: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. A ship with too few crew to actually man these departments may have to double-up on staffing, but these five functions are the ones that are critical during space combat, and every ship has to be able to act on them.

The ***bridge*** is where the ship's piloting and navigation is done. This might be no more than the cramped cockpit of a starfighter or it might be a cavernous central control node in the bowels of a battleship. The bridge department handles attempts to escape combat, perform evasive maneuvers, or pursue a fleeing enemy. ^ship-departments-bridge

The ***gunnery*** department is in charge of the ship's weaponry. If it's used to blow pieces out of something unfriendly, it's in the charge of the gunners who man this department. They're the ones who fire a ship's guns and make the targeting calculations necessary to snipe specific systems and weapons on a hostile target. ^ship-departments-gunnery

***Engineering*** keeps the ship flying when enemies are carving chunks out of her hull. They can perform damage control, boost the engines to speed a ship's maneuvers, and execute emergency repairs to get a damaged system back online before it's too late. ^ship-departments-engineering

The ***comms*** department doesn't just handle inter-ship communications, but it also manages sensors, electronic warfare, and combat hacking duties. Their crew can baffle enemy targeting attempts, fool hostile sensors, and choke enemy computers with ECM. ^ship-departments-comms

The ***captain*** is master of the ship and directs the other departments. On a warship, this discipline might be taut and automatic. On a ship piloted by PCs, obedience may be less certain. Regardless, the captain can boost the effectiveness of other departments, direct crew for perilous but necessary tasks, or convert otherwise-crippling hits into more manageable crises. ^ship-departments-captain

For player-run ships, every PC should be put in charge of one of these departments, preferably the one that best suits their character's skills. If a PC is totally incompetent for space combat, they can be given temporary control of the NPC officer who actually is in charge of the department, and can run that NPC as their character during the fight. If the ship is so small that there is no NPC available to run the department, then the PC is treated as a supernumerary officer, and can only take actions from the general action list available to all departments.

Sometimes there are fewer PCs than there are departments. In that case, double-up the duties of two or more departments on a single PC. That PC can still only take actions from one departments per turn; any departments they don't take an action from are assumed to use the *Do Your Duty* action, adding 1 Command Point to the ship's available total. Thus, if a PC was in charge of both the bridge and the comms, she could take actions either from the bridge list, the comms list, or the general list of actions. If she didn't pick any action from the bridge or comms list, the neglected department would simply use *Do Your Duty* to add +1 Command Point to the ship's available total. For a single-seat fighter, the lone crewman might have all five departments on his head. Such a pilot would be able to take actions from any single department each round with the other four providing 4 Command Points to fuel that action.

Sometimes the PCs may want to swap departments in mid-battle for some reason, or to replace a department head who has been incapacitated. They may do so at the start of any given combat turn provided that the department heads involved do not object.

## Actions and Command Points

At the start of every ship's turn, the captain decides the order in which the departments will take their action. In the chaos of combat, she can give directions to the heads, but they are not obligated to follow them.

When a department's turn comes up, the PC in charge chooses actions, either from their department list or the general action list. Some actions may require skill checks to execute properly, while others are automatically successful. Some actions may require Command Points to be spent in order to attempt them, while others give Command Points. A few prohibit the PC from doing any other action that round.

Barring these actions, a department head can take as many actions as they have Command Points to spend on them. A gunnery chief with 4 Command Points, for example, could use the *Fire One Weapon* action twice, spending 2 Command Points each time, or he could use the *Fire All Guns* action once, spending 3 Command Points and leaving 1 left. The department head does not need to get permission to spend points from the rest of the crew; if he decides to burn the points to open fire when the rest of the crew wanted him to save them, that's too bad for the rest of the crew. A traitorous or uncooperative department head can only be stopped by PC intervention with the *Deal With a Crisis* action.

After every department has acted, all excess Command Points are lost. Ships normally start their turns with 0 Command Points.

## Attacks and Damage

When a ship fires a weapon, it can choose any target involved in the combat. Either the gunnery department head, an NPC, or a nominated PC may make the attack, but a given gunner can man only one gun a round. The gunnery head is always the one to spend Command Points to fire, but their nominees may be the ones actually manning the guns and rolling the attacks.

The gunner rolls a normal hit roll, using their base attack bonus plus the better of their Intelligence or Dexterity mods, plus their Shoot skill. If flying a fighter-class ship, Pilot may be used in place of Shoot. Foci that normally give bonuses to Shoot attacks, such as *Gunslinger*, do not apply to ship combat unless specifically noted as doing so. The luck ability of the Warrior class may be used once per fight to hit with ship guns, but cannot be used to negate a hit against their ship.

If the hit roll equals or exceeds the target ship's Armor Class, the attack is a success and the attacker may roll damage, again modified by the better of the gunner's Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. This damage is lessened by the target's Armor score, which may in turn be negated by a gun's Armor-Piercing quality. A successful hit by a plasma beam, for example, does 3d6 damage plus the gunner's attribute modifier, with an Armor Piercing quality of 10. Against a free merchant with an Armor score of 2, the full damage of the beam gets through, as the AP 10 cancels out all the merchant's Armor.

Armor can negate all damage from a hit if it's strong enough. If Armor completely negates the attack, the hit cannot disable systems. Sufficiently skilled gunners can use the *Target System* action to aim a shot at a particular weapon system, engine, or other fitting that seems vulnerable to the GM. On such a hit, the damage is halved, rounded up, before Armor is applied. If any damage gets through, that system is disabled and cannot be used until it is repaired. Engines lose one drive rank instead, so that a drive-2 spike drive becomes a drive-1 until repaired. Disabled systems hit again or drives reduced below drive-0 are destroyed, and cannot be repaired during combat. A ship with destroyed engines cannot perform any bridge actions and may be boarded at an attacking ship's leisure, assuming its guns are also disabled.

If a ship is reduced to zero [hit points](#^starship-hit-points), fighter-class hulls are instantly destroyed with all hands. Larger ships are mortally damaged. Such crippled ships can take no action and will explode within 2d6 minutes unless the chief engineer succeeds in an Int/Fix skill check against difficulty 10. On a failure, the explosion is inevitable, while on a success the ship merely becomes a burnt-out hulk with all systems destroyed. If sufficiently vast amounts of repair supplies are still intact in the hold, a determined crew might be able to jury-rig the maimed ship into temporary operation.

## Ship Crises

Instead of accepting some particularly gruesome hit or disabling attack, a PC ship can instead choose to accept a ***Crisis***. The attack or the disabling hit is then negated, with no damage done. Instead, the GM rolls on the Crisis table to find out what dire event happened as a consequence of the hit, instead of the ship damage.

Some of these Crises are continuing. They will continue to plague the ship until a PC can solve them with the *Deal With a Crisis* general action. Usually this involves a skill check at difficulty 10, but multiple PCs can choose to take the *Deal With a Crisis* action to cooperate in resolving the problem that round.

Some of these Crises are acute. The PCs must resolve them before the end of the ship's next turn or else something very bad will happen.

A ship can accept only one Crisis per round, not including the *Into the Fire* or *Keep it Together* captain actions which may be taken at the captain's discretion. Thus, if the ship is hit twice, only one of those hits can be converted into a Crisis unless the captain uses one of these actions. A ship accepts a Crisis if any of the department heads requests it, even if the rest of the heads don't want one. Thus, if the ship's main gun is hit, the gunnery chief can request a Crisis to prevent the hit even if the rest of the crew was against it.

To simplify ship combat, NPC ships do not normally accept more than one Crisis per space combat, at most.

They usually just take the damage or negative effects of hits straight until facing imminent ruin.

## Handling Crises

To resolve a Crisis, a PC needs to take the *Deal With a Crisis* general action on their department turn. They must explain what they are doing to solve the problem to the GM, who will then tell them what combination of attribute and skill they should roll. The usual difficulty of resolving a crisis is 10, though the GM may increase or decrease that difficulty by up to 2 points either way depending on how bad the Crisis is and how useful the PC's plan is to resolve it.

If the PC succeeds in the roll, the Crisis is ended. Continuing Crises no longer apply their penalty to the ship, and acute Crises are defused before disaster can strike. If they fail, a continuing Crisis is unchanged and an acute one is yet unresolved.

More than one PC can try to resolve a Crisis, either making an independent attempt if they have a relevant skill, or using their talents to aid the main responder with the usual rules for aiding another's skill check.

The *Deal With a Crisis* general action can also be used to get a scene's worth of general activity aboard the ship. If a xenomorphic monster suddenly breaches the ship's hull during a battle with its alien mothership, two of the PCs might take the *Deal With a Crisis* action to spend a scene battling the beast in the guts of the ship while the rest of the party tries to keep the ship fighting.

## Running a Crisis

> When a Crisis hits a ship, the GM should describe it in a concrete way. A *Crew Lost* crisis, for example, may be described as “A damage control squad has been trapped in the engine room and temperatures are rising dangerously high.” A *Hull Breach* might be described as “That last hit drove a support column through a capacitor bank; it's about to explode.” It should be described as a specific problem that threatens the ship.
>
> In turn, when a PC chooses to *Deal With a Crisis*, they should indicate what it is exactly that they're trying to do. A PC with Fix might declare that they're trying to pump coolant into the engine room, or a telekinetic PC might try to forcibly eject the capacitor bank before it can explode.
>
> Don't worry about being too technically precise with descriptions, or painstakingly deciding whether the ship has available coolant supplies or whether the capacitor is one ton or two. Decide whether or not the plan the PC is declaring is plausible or not in the general sense, and set the difficulty accordingly.  Extremely good plans or applicable abilities might make the Crisis resolution check as easy as difficulty 8, while a very marginal plan that doesn't seem likely to help might be difficulty 12. Whatever you do, keep it quick; don't drag it out in play.

## Ship Combat Actions

Every PC can take one or more actions per ship round. PCs who are department heads can pick actions from their department. Any PC can pick from the general actions. Some actions prohibit any other act that round.

Most actions have a cost in Command Points. Usually, some PCs choose to *Do Your Duty* or go *Above and Beyond* to generate Command Points, while others then spend them on actions for their department. All unspent Command Points are lost at the round's end.

NPC ships usually have a base number of Command Points they can spend each round, and may pick actions freely to spend them. For simplicity, NPC ships can't usually generate more Command Points with their actions and can't normally take Captain actions.

### Bridge Actions

- ***Escape Combat (4 CP):*** Roll an opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/Pilot skill check plus your ship's Speed against the fastest opponent's skill check plus their ship's Speed. On a win, all enemy ships gain one point of Escape. If an enemy ship gets three points, after three uses of this maneuver, your ship gets away from that ship and is no longer in combat with it. ^bridge-actions-escape-combat

- ***Evasive Maneuvers (2 CP):*** Roll Int or Dex/Pilot against difficulty 9 to add your Pilot skill to the ship's AC until its next turn. Usable once per round at most. ^bridge-actions-evasive-maneuvers

- ***Pursue Target (3 CP):*** Opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/ Pilot skill check plus Speed against the target ship's skill check plus Speed. On a win, you shed one point of Escape rating the target ship may have on you. ^bridge-actions-pursue-target

### Captain Actions

- ***Into the Fire (0 CP):*** Accept a *Crew Lost* Crisis and gain your Lead skill plus one in Command Points. You may do this at most once per round. ^captain-actions-into-the-fire

- ***Keep It Together (0 CP):*** Nullify a successful enemy hit and roll a Crisis instead. You can use this action in Instant response to an enemy hit but you may only use it once per round. ^captain-actions-keep-it-together

- ***Support Department (0 CP):*** Choose a department. One action that department takes will require 2 fewer Command Points. You can do this once per round. ^captain-actions-support-department

### Comms Actions

- ***Crash Systems (2 CP):*** Roll an opposed Int/Program check against a targeted ship. On a success, it starts its next turn with a Command Point penalty equal to your Program skill. ^comms-actions-crash-systems

- ***Defeat ECM (2 CP):*** Roll an opposed Int/Program against a targeted ship. On a success, any attacks this round by your ship against the target get a hit bonus equal to twice your Program skill. ^comms-actions-defeat-ecm

- ***Sensor Ghost (2 CP):*** Succeed on a difficulty 9 Int/ Program check to gain your Program as an AC bonus until the next turn. Usable once per round at most. ^comms-actions-sensor-ghost

### Engineering Actions

- ***Boost Engines (2 CP):*** Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 8. On a success, the ship's Speed is increased by 2 until the start of the ship's next turn. ^engineering-actions-boost-engines

- ***Damage Control (3 CP):*** Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 7. On a success, repair a number of lost [hit points](#^starship-hit-points) equal to your Fix skill times 2 for fighter hulls, 3 for frigates, 4 for cruisers, and 6 for capital-class hulls. Each attempt of this action after the first in a fight increases its difficulty by a cumulative +1. ^engineering-actions-damage-control

- ***Emergency Repairs (3 CP):*** Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 8. On a success, a disabled system is repaired or a damage-degraded drive has its rating increased by 1. Destroyed systems cannot be fixed this way. ^engineering-actions-emergency-repairs

### Gunnery Actions

- ***Fire All Guns (3 CP):*** Gunners fire all weapons mounted on the ship, designating targets as they wish. ^gunnery-actions-fire-all-guns

- ***Fire One Weapon (2 CP):*** A gunner fires a single ship's weapon of their choice. ^gunnery-actions-fire-one-weapon

- ***Target Systems (1 CP):*** A *Fire One Weapon* action you take this round may target a ship's weapons, engine, or fittings the GM decides are vulnerable. Such targeted attacks take -4 to hit. On a hit, do half damage before applying Armor. If damage gets through the system is disabled or drive is degraded by 1 level. Disabled systems hit again are destroyed. You may take this action more than once to aim additional shots you may fire. ^gunnery-actions-target-systems

### General Actions

All these general actions are exclusive; if you take one of these actions you can do nothing else in the round, either before or after you take the action.

- ***Above and Beyond (0 CP):*** Push yourself to help the ship or its crew. Pick an attribute and skill check and explain how you're using it to help the ship. If the GM agrees, roll it against difficulty 9. On a success, gain your skill level in Command Points plus one. On a failure, take -1 Command Point. ^general-actions-above-and-beyond

- ***Deal With a Crisis (0 CP):*** Explain what you are doing to solve a Crisis and roll the relevant skill check. The difficulty is usually 10, plus or minus 2 depending on the situation and the effectiveness of your action. On a success, the Crisis is resolved. You may also use this action to aid another PC in resolving a Crisis, or to take one scene's worth of other actions around the ship. ^general-actions-deal-with-a-crisis

- ***Do Your Duty (0 CP):*** The ship gains 1 Command Point. PCs who head more than one department can act only in one of them; the rest automatically take this action. If invoked by a PC, they must name some plausible act the PC is doing to be useful, and can't do the same act two rounds in a row. ^general-actions-do-your-duty

## Ship Crises

Once per round, a ship may choose to accept a Crisis instead of taking an enemy hit. They must choose to do so immediately after damage is rolled, and only one player needs to request the Crisis to get it even if the rest of the party doesn't want it. Once the Crisis is accepted, the hit is negated and the GM rolls on the table.

The captain may also choose to voluntarily accept a Crisis through their *Keep It Together* or *Into the Fire* department actions. Use of these actions doesn't count against the one-voluntary-Crisis-perround maximum.

Some Crises are continuing. They will apply a penalty to the ship that continues until some PC successfully performs a *Deal With a Crisis* action.

Other Crises are acute. They inflict no immediate negative consequence, but if the PCs don't resolve it by the end of the next combat round, an unpleasant consequence will ensue. The Crisis is then removed.

The same Crisis rolled more than once will stack on the ship, though hits to empty cargo holds or dry fuel tanks may not be much of a problem to the ship.

## Dealing With a Crisis

Any PC can *Deal With a Crisis* by taking that general action and describing what they're doing to solve the problem. They then roll an applicable skill check against difficulty 10, possibly modified by up to plus or minus two depending on the GM's judgment of their general plan and its likelihood of being helpful. On a success, the Crisis is resolved. All Crises are considered resolved at the end of an engagement.

## Crises

- ***Armor Loss:*** The hit melted an important patch of ship armor, cracked an internal support, or exposed a sensitive system. Until resolved, the ship's Armor rating is halved, rounded down.

- ***Cargo Loss:*** The hit has gored open a cargo bay, threatening to dump the hold or expose delicate contents to ruinous damage. If not resolved by the end of the next round, lose d10\*10% of the ship's cargo.

- ***Crew Lost:*** Brave crew risk their lives to keep damaged systems operating. Describe the danger they face. If the Crisis is not resolved by the end of the next round, 10% of the ship's maximum crew are incapacitated, not counting any *Extended Life Support* fittings.

Half these crewmen are dead or permanently disabled, and the other half return to duty in a week. *Extended Medbay* fittings halve the number of dead and crippled. If the ship has run out of NPC crew when it takes this Crisis, a random PC must roll a Physical save; on a success, they lose half their [hit points](#^character-hit-points), while on a failure, they are mortally wounded. If not stabilized by the end of the ship's turn through some PC taking a *Deal With A Crisis* action to heal them, they will die.

### Table - Starship Crises

| d10 | Crisis               | Type       |
|:---:| -------------------- | ---------- |
|  1  | Armor Loss           | Continuing |
|  2  | Cargo Loss           | Acute      |
|  3  | Crew Lost            | Acute      |
|  4  | Engine Lock          | Continuing |
|  5  | Fuel Bleed           | Acute      |
|  6  | Haywire Systems      | Continuing |
|  7  | Hull Breach          | Acute      |
|  8  | System Damage        | Continuing |
|  9  | Target Decalibration | Continuing |
| 10  | VIP Imperiled        | Acute      |


- ***Engine Lock:*** The ship's engine has been jammed or control circuits have gone non-responsive. Until resolved, no bridge actions can be taken, though the pilot can still perform general actions.

- ***Fuel Bleed:*** The ship's fuel tanks have been holed or emergency vents have been force-triggered by battle damage. If not resolved by the end of the next round, the ship will jettison all fuel except the minimal amount needed for in-system operation.

- ***Haywire Systems:*** Critical command links have been damaged or disordered by the hit. Until resolved, the ship starts each round at -2 Command Points. Multiple such Crises can stack this penalty, crippling a ship until the Crises are resolved.

- ***Hull Breach:*** The hull has been damaged in a way that is currently non-critical but is about to tear open an important compartment or crumple on vital systems. If not resolved by the end of the next round, the ship will take damage: 1d10 for fighter-class hulls, 2d10 for frigates, 3d10 for cruisers, and 4d10 for capital hulls, all ignoring Armor.

- ***System Damage:*** One of the ship's systems has been cooked by the hit. The GM randomly picks a weapon, fitting, or engine; that system is disabled as if hit with a targeted shot, with drives suffering a 1 point drive level decrease. Disabled systems hit by this Crisis or drives reduced below drive-0 are destroyed and cannot be repaired during combat.

- ***Target Decalibration:*** The gunnery computers are hopelessly confused and cannot lock the ship's weaponry on a target until this Crisis is resolved.

- ***VIP Imperiled:*** Shipboard damage threatens a random PC or important NPC. That victim must immediately roll a Physical saving throw; on a success, they lose half their [hit points](#^character-hit-points), and on a failure they are mortally wounded. NPC crew can make a free attempt to stabilize the downed VIP using their usual NPC skill bonus. If the NPC fails, and no PC takes a *Deal With a Crisis* action to successfully stabilize them by the end of the ship's turn, they die.

## The Thunder of the Guns

> The free merchant *Grendel* finds herself engaging the *Sacred Wrath*, a patrol boat of the Luminous Hegemony determined to stop the *Grendel* before it can deliver its cargo of military supplies to the rebel outpost that contracted the ship. Captain Wilhelmina Stokes knows she's substantially outclassed by the patrol boat, but she trusts her comrades and is determined to blast her way through.
>
> The combat begins with an initiative roll. The *Grendel*'s pilot rolls 1d8 plus the best of his Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers, getting a 6. The *Wrath*'s pilot rolls a 4, so *Grendel* goes first.
>
> Grendel starts her turn with 0 Command Points. Captain Stokes decides that she'll act first among the crew, and uses the *Support Department* action to aid the gunnery department; one action the gunner takes will be 2 Command Points cheaper than usual.
>
> The ship still has no Command Points, however, so Captain Stokes tells the comms chief to go next. Feeling daring, the comms chief decides to go *Above and Beyond* to help the ship, overclocking the ship's computing core. The GM decides this is an Int/Program skill check, so the comms chief rolls it against difficulty 9. He fails his first roll, but uses his Expert class reroll benefit to try again, and gets it the second time. The ship gains 3 Command Points for the comms chief's Program-2 skill.
>
> Stokes considers letting the gunner blaze away now, but she wants to go for a real torrent of fire to open the fight, so she asks the bridge pilot to act next to build more Command Points. He chooses to *Do Your Duty*, adding 1 CP and declaring that he's lining the ship up for the shot.
>
> Three Command Points aren't enough for the captain, so despite the gunner's entreaties, she chooses for the engineer to go next. She also plays it safe, deciding to *Do Your Duty* and feed power to the guns.
>
> Lastly, there's a sixth PC in the crew, a storyteller with absolutely no applicable space-faring skills. Even though he is no department head, the captain nominates him to act next, since every PC gets to act each round. Able to take only general actions, the storyteller chants a mighty lay of battle to encourage his comrades on to glory. The GM lets him roll a Cha/Perform skill check to go *Above and Beyond*, and he succeeds, adding 3 more Command Points from his Perform-2 skill.
>
> Now, at last, with 8 Command Points, the captain gives the gunner her signal. The gunner decides that it's absolutely critical to defang the patrol boat before it can open up with its plasma beam. He chooses to *Target Systems* with his attack, spending 1 CP. He knows the free merchant's sandcaster has no chance of piercing the patrol boat's armor, but his multifocal laser can cut through the ship's plating. Thus, instead of trying to fire the sandcaster this round, he decides to blaze away exclusively with the laser, using the *Fire One Weapon* action.
>
> Firing one weapon costs 2 Command Points and he has 5 left, plus the captain's *Support Department* action to give him a zero-cost shot.
>
> The gunner is a grizzled Warrior and uses his class ability to make the first shot an automatic hit. He rolls 1d4 for damage, +1 for his Dexterity modifier, and gets a 3. The multifocal laser's armor-piercing quality of 20 overwhelms the patrol boat's Armor of 5, but since he's *Targeting Systems*, his damage is halved, rounded up. The patrol boat takes 2 [hit points](#^starship-hit-points) of damage&hellip; but its plasma beam is now disabled until the boat's crew can perform repairs.
>
> The gunner's not satisfied; he wants that gun wrecked. He *Fires One Weapon* again for 2 CP, *Targeting Systems* once more for 1 CP, rolling a hit roll at -4 and using his Shoot skill and Dexterity attribute to modify his attack bonus. He hits with a 15 and does another 2 damage, destroying the gun.
>
> The GM decides that the patrol boat's captain is willing to go to extremes to prevent this, and lets him accept a Crisis instead. The GM rolls 1d10 and gets the *Hull Breach* crisis; if the boat can't resolve it by the end of the next round, it'll take 2d10 [hit points](#^starship-hit-points) of damage that ignores Armor, but for now the gunner's second hit is negated. The gunner has 2 CP left, so he burns those and his captain-supplied free shot on two more attacks, both of which miss. The round ends, and if the *Grendel* had any CP left it would lose them now.
>
> Being a properly-trained military crew, the *Sacred Wrath* has 5 Command Points. Her captain knows that her absolute priority is getting her gun back online, so he spends 3 points to do *Emergency Repairs* from the engineer actions. The GM rolls her crew's default +2 skill bonus and gets a 9, enough to fix the plasma beam and remove its disabled status.
>
> That leaves the NPC ship with 2 Command Points left, which is just enough to open fire. The gunner blasts away with the plasma beam, using his hit bonus of +4 to get a 17, enough to hit the *Grendel*. The plasma beam does 12 points of damage to the free merchant, its AP 10 defeating the target's Armor.
>
> Captain Stokes can't handle a hit like this and immediately accepts a Crisis. The GM rolls an *Armor Loss* result, halving the *Grendel*'s already-sad Armor.
>
> The next round then begins. The PCs have the edge, as the *Wrath* is going to need to *Deal With a Crisis* or take a heavy hit at round's end. If the *Grendel*'s gunner can't shut down that plasma beam, however, the free merchant runs the risk of eating more hits than it can survive&hellip; or trying to evade those hits and rolling a Crisis her crew can't handle.

# THE HISTORY OF SPACE

The default setting of ***Stars Without Number*** is a far future age in which the sprawling, glorious domain of human space has been reduced to a scattering of squabbling powers and long-lost worlds. The ancient domain of humanity has shrunken with the collapse of the psi-powered Jump Gates that once stitched the remote regions of the frontier into the teeming worlds of the human core.

Now, almost six hundred years after the catastrophe that ended the Golden Age of Man, new hope rises from the wreckage of a fallen empire.

## In the Beginning

Humanity's interstellar history began in a musty instafab laboratory on a remote coast in northern Greenland in the year 2108. A small army of jury-rigged microfab plants and hotwired autofacs had been churning for years, painstakingly realizing the plans of their creator. Dr. Tiberius Crohn was an insular lunatic of the first water, a laughingstock among physicists and a regular font of absurd claims. Were it not for his admitted talent at wrangling autofacs he would likely have vanished into the twenty-second century's faceless proletarian mass without so much as a ripple.

His talents had gotten him the parts and resources to establish his laboratory in the radioactive wilds of Greenland, not far from the hot zone left by a missile from the Russo-European War. The glow masked the peculiar emissions from his test units, but in 2108 his work finally reached fruition. Crohn had invented the spike drive, the faster-than-light engine that would lift humanity to the stars.

Even now, a thousand years later, researchers still wonder how Crohn managed to devise the mathematics and theories that supported the spike drive's creation. Widespread claims of “alien influence” were debunked by later Mandate historians, but rumors of these “Mentors” are still stock space legends.

Some of the axioms involved defied all perceptible reality, and the theories made certain assumptions about the fabric of the universe that spun off at least a dozen new religions within the first two hundred years of the discovery. The spike drive was a window on a universe far stranger and vaster than experimenters had thought possible.

Through a delicate gravitic twisting of the universal substrate beneath a ship, the spike drive drove it “upward” through a spectrum of dimensional frequencies. The ship vanished from mundane, “luminal” space and was thrust into the metadimensions. These inchoate realms of vast energy currents and formless masses were extremely hostile to unprepared ships, but their gravitic currents propelled a ship at speeds impossible in the mundane universe. Suitably massive objects such as stars cast a “shadow” into these metadimensions, forming both navigational beacons and anchor-points that enabled transit up and down the dimensional spectrum. So long as a spike drive had a star to launch from and a star to bring it down, it could ride the metadimensional currents in a headlong rush of superluminal speed.

The initial transit along a course was always the most dangerous. The metadimensional currents were unmapped on those routes, and a navigator had to make regular course corrections in hope of finding a current that would bring them to their course before the spike drive's protective bubble broke down in the metadimensional environment.

Once the initial journey had been made, course rutters could be shared with other ships. So long as ships regularly made the transit, any shifts in the currents could be recorded. If a route lay fallow for too long, however, the slow creep of currents would render the rutters worse than useless, and a fresh course would need to be plotted by some brave crew.

Crohn's discovery was announced by the sudden launch of his retrofitted spacecraft-laboratory from the Greenland hot zone. A number of orbital weapons platforms attempted to bring it down, but the spike drive provided such a wildly anomalous maneuver profile that the tracking algorithms were hopelessly confused. Earthside watch stations followed him out to the edge of the solar system, dutifully recording his ship's impossible velocity. At the very rim of the system the sensors picked up a strange gravitic surge, and he was gone.

He returned thirteen days later, broadcasting a radio transmission that not only included data on Alpha Centauri that could only have been acquired through on-site surveying, but also included the necessary data for the reconstruction of the spike drive. Between the observations of the tracking stations and the content of the signal, there was no doubt of it; mad old Crohn had actually done it.

Even today, no one is entirely certain how he managed it. A prototype spike drive would have required six days of metadimensional travel to reach Alpha Centauri and drill down into mundane space. Crohn claimed to be alone aboard the ship, but such would have required him to remain awake and navigating the uncharted drill course for six straight days, all without any hint of prior experience. The creed that later became known as the *Book of the Sky* refers to it as “the Night Journey of the Prophet Tiberius” and considers it the founding event of the faith.

Tiberius himself promptly drilled back out into metaspace once his transmission had been sent. He was never seen again. To this day, thirteen known religious sects are convinced that he was translated directly into the presence of God as a fitting reward to the opener of the celestial ways.

## The First Wave of Colonization

Exclusivity was impossible with this new discovery. Overnight, every industrialized nation on Earth began a frantic rush to build spike drive-equipped starships, each nation fearing to be left behind in claiming the stars above. Paradoxically, earthside tensions faded rapidly as the disposition of this spit of land or that patch of oil seemed to be trivial compared to the wealth that awaited in the sky.

Initial exploration revealed that the spike drives had a maximum range before the corrosive effect of the metadimensional environment fatally degraded their protective bubbles of mundane space. It was necessary to hop from star to star, reaching more distant stellar bodies by progressive advance. In the course of these explorations numerous exotic planetary bodies were discovered. The first one habitable by human beings was a barren mudball with an oxygen-rich atmosphere discovered in 2113. Dubbed Renaissance by its Greater European discoverers, it drove the other Terran nations outward in an even greater frenzy of exploratory acquisitiveness.

Pan-Indian scouts discovered the first life-bearing world in 2150. The primordial soup that covered the water world of Pranashakti served as a research subject for a generation of xenobiologists. The excitement was only heightened when an American survey craft discovered the ancient alien ruins on the mist-shrouded moon called Typhon. Their creators had vanished more than 40,000 years ago, but the scanty remains showed evidence of a technologically sophisticated culture possessing a humanoid anatomy not wholly unlike that of humankind.

This First Wave of colonization sent humanity in a steadily expanding sphere from the green fields of Terra. By 2200, most habitable worlds within a year's spike drive travel had at least a handful of human inhabitants. Numerous political and religious splinter groups took to the heavens once asteroid mining brought the price of a spike drive-equipped starship within the reach of a large corporation. Humanity was growing beyond the reach of its leaders.

## Retrenchment and the Mandate

The governments of Terra grew increasingly concerned with their far-flung colonists. Even the fastest spike drive courier couldn't reach the Rim worlds in less than four months, and projecting military force at such a distance was beyond the power of all but the strongest nations. Rather than let their colonists slip entirely out of their control, the greater powers on Terra agreed to form the Terran Mandate, an organization dedicated to policing human space and exerting the authority of Terran governments over the far-flung colony worlds.

Furthermore, expansion beyond the current Rim worlds was forbidden. Splinter groups, cults, and microcultures were required to live within the pale and were forbidden to colonize worlds of their own for reasons of “social harmony” and “interstellar security”. More than a few of these groups defied the new Mandate and sought worlds beyond their reach in the far dark. Deprived of the usual sources of support, most were never heard from again.

Even with these new limits, the Terran Mandate was hard-pressed to contain the colonial worlds. There was little in the way of actual fighting between the colonies, as few had the ships or manpower to spare, but here and there the more zealous splinter groups or dedicated ideologues could not bear to live in peace with their neighbors. The Mandate kept a loose sort of discipline over the Rim worlds but by the year 2260 direct control was tenuous at best.

## MES and the Psionic Authority

It was during the peak of the First Wave, in 2240, that the first instances of a frightening new syndrome appeared in the children of starship crew members. Perhaps one in ten thousand of these children would begin to exhibit strange and inexplicable powers. Some time around puberty, abilities manifested that ranged from an intuitive vision of the immediate future, to inexplicable mind-reading, to powers of superluminal teleportation. Children who exercised these abilities invariably suffered progressive and permanent neural damage leading either to death or permanent insanity. A dozen uses, two dozen&hellip; sooner or later the damage overwhelmed the victim. Only by completely avoiding use of these powers could a child's mind be saved.

Dubbed “Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome”, or “MES” by researchers, these subjects were gathered for extensive testing and examination. Parents were told that the children would be taught ways of controlling and suppressing their abilities, but most modern researchers believe that some among the children were used as guinea pigs in terrible experiments meant to quantify this new power. Whatever the means, the investigators soon learned that “Messes” were actually serving as living channels for waves of metadimensional energy.

The power was shaped and focused by the wielder's neural pathways. Mere meat was never meant to endure the kind of energies that boiled through a Mess, and neural pathways were left scorched or burnt out entirely by use of the powers. Every test was destructive. The only question was whether repeated use of the powers would kill the Mess' body first or take their sanity. Researchers also discovered that once the energies had finally burnt out a victim's mind, the charred brain pathways were effectively immune to further damage. An insane Mess, or “feral” could use their powers with impunity, and usually did.

It wasn't until 2275 that these shadowy researches finally bore fruit. The damage to a Mess's mind could not be avoided, but by individualized programs of meditation, focus, and mental training, the damage could be routed through less critical areas of the brain. A properly-trained “psychic”, as they were now called, could use their powers extensively before the charge threatened to overflow their existing channels and they were required to rest and recuperate.

Formulating these programs of study required a trained psychic mentor to shape the basic curriculum into the correct sequence of meditations for a given pupil. Despite the best efforts of researchers, it proved impossible to impart this education through recorded means of instruction. A living, psychically-active metapsion tutor properly educated in the training protocols was mandatory in teaching new psychics.

In an attempt to control the provision of psychic mentors, the Terran Mandate inaugurated the Psionic Authority. The PA grew to be a quiet but pervasive organization throughout human space, taking young MES sufferers into its care for training. The rarity of MES left psychics largely as figures of mystery and no little fear to less gifted humans. Psychics could often make vast sums of money with their powers, but many worlds established sharp restrictions on psychic activities&hellip; and then often employed government-sponsored psychics who could ignore the strictures.

## First Contacts

As these changes rippled through human culture, the species found itself no longer alone in the cosmos. The steady expansion of human space discovered more than empty ruins on several habitable worlds. The Young Races such as the Kont and Ualub were found inhabiting their ancestral worlds, diligently building their way towards Bronze Age technologies. Some species seemed to be the decaying remnants of a former empire, such as the handful of used-up worlds that housed the weary race of Mettau and their cities of dancing glass. These Elder Races had all had their time in the sun, tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago, only to fall prey to internecine strife, vainglorious experimentation, or sheer cultural ennui.

Some of these alien races were strong and vigorous still, though usually fresh from their own technological youth. A few short, sharp border wars usually settled matters in humanity's favor, and even those wars that were not so successfully prosecuted lost mankind only a few worlds within easy reach of their rivals. More often, these races formed uneasy trade pacts with humanity, exchanging examples of strange alien technology and art for the science of human worlds.

The majority of sentient alien species that humanity discovered shared roughly similar humanoid dimensions. Called “the Like” by xenobiologists, controversy still bubbles over the seeming prevalence of humanoid form among alien races. Some scientists suggest that the humanoid shape is simply the one most suitable to the expression of sentience. Others find this explanation too simplistic, and believe that humanoid shapes are simply most suitable to the kind of human-habitable biomes that draw the most interest from human explorers. Further exploration might reveal legions of supercondensed life forms in the core of gas giant worlds, or flocks of hydrogen-based webs floating in the darkness between stars.

Some species owe nothing to human form. These Others are alien in a way that no oxygen-breather could possibly be. Some are composed of silicon or alien earth compounds, such as the “lithomorphs” and their planetoid-ships. Others are congeries of spherical atmosphere-bubbles, or sentient interference-patterns set up in the oceans of an ammonia-covered liquid world. The Others are almost invariably too different in mind and needs for humans to communicate with them. Their acts of violence are inexplicable and seemingly random, and their purposes defy human comprehension. Psychics who attempt to contact the mind of an Other risk their sanity under waves of awareness utterly unlike the thoughts of a fleshly brain.

## Pretech, Psitech, and the Gates

Psionic Authority researchers had not halted their study of MES energies after their initial training breakthroughs. Official histories credit the discoveries to the courage of a few psychics willing to conduct destructive, dangerous experiments on their own minds. Legends speak more of criminal psychics and bewildered young Messes “encouraged” to cooperate in experiments that eventually claimed their sanity or their lives.

Whatever the source of the data, the Psionic Authority was able to formulate new techniques of psychic power. These abilities were usually very subtle and esoteric, microscopic adjustments of ambient universal constants that allowed for the manufacture of materials and products that were simply impossible to create with technology bound to the mundane world's laws. Atoms and molecules danced to the will of these fabricator psychics, and new wonders were born from the factories of humanity.

The introduction of psychic fabrication marked the development of “pretech”, the high science and artifice of the Golden Age of Man. Pretech artifacts were marvelous works, most of them performing some miracle of energy manipulation or material science. Pretech spike drives doubled the maximum reach of a drill course, and pretech drugs and biotech gave humankind several centuries of hale good health before age might claim them.

The greatest accomplishment of pretech, however, was in the development of “psitech”, a complex melding of psychofabricated pretech components and psionically-active materials. Psitech devices could channel and amplify a psychic's abilities to a remarkable degree. Psitech was never common, given the rarity of psychics themselves, but it found regular employment in pretech manufactories.

The greatest accomplishment of psitech, in turn, was the development of the Jump Gates. These massive rings of psitech resonators floated at the far rim of a solar system, wide enough to receive the slowboat freighters that lumbered out from planetary orbits. With the help of a choir of master psychic teleporters, these ships would be hurled for scores of light years across the galaxy, emerging from a Jump Gate held in waiting at their destination point. The weeks or months of spike drive travel that would otherwise be required were compressed into a few days.

The Jump Gates quickly replaced spike drive travel throughout the core regions of human space. The only check on their expansion was finding the necessary number of master teleporters to power them, and the great expense of shipping components out to more distant worlds unable to fabricate them on-site. By 2450, almost all core and Rim worlds were served by Jump Gates. The ease and cheapness of mass interstellar transport caused some worlds to specialize as agricultural planets and other worlds to rely on interstellar food imports.

By 2600, spike drives were antiquated technology, found almost exclusively along the frontier of human space where Jump Gates were too expensive and economies too primitive to justify their use.

## The Second Wave

By then, the Second Wave of human colonization had reached its peak. The development of the Jump Gates had allowed the Terran Mandate to project its military strength far more easily, and the prohibitions on expansion had been loosened. By 2600, the frontier of human space extended almost ten years of spike drive travel away from Terra. Even after taking Jump Gates as far as possible, a fast pretech courier ship required a year to reach the farthest colonial worlds.

The Jump Gates allowed for massive numbers of colonists to flee the stultifying bonds of stratified Terran society. Over four billion people left Terra over the course of the Second Wave, most of them sent gladly by governments that were more than willing to dispose of their more troublesome subjects. It wasn't until late in the Second Wave that the Terran Mandate began to realize that it simply didn't have the manpower necessary to police the colonial worlds. Even with the overwhelming technological advantage of Terran fleets, there were simply too many colonies and too many colonists to maintain direct control.

The colonies realized this as well, starting around 2450. There was rarely an explicit rebellion against the Mandate; most often it was a disobedience of slow decay, with tax shipments becoming intermittent and then absent, and Mandate orders obeyed first slowly and then not at all. The Mandate fleet struck a few of the most valuable recalcitrants, but it was a rear-guard action. The Terran Mandate had grown itself beyond its ability to maintain control.

In the wild void of the frontier, spike drive armadas and petty stellar kingdoms formed to settle ancient arguments between ideologies, religions, and simple differences of ambition. Maltech research began to take root on more isolated worlds, with forbidden research into unbraked AIs, replicant nanotech, and weapons of planetary destruction. Some worlds began to experiment with human genomic modification beyond anything that convention had permitted. These eugenics cultists sought the wholesale improvement of the human genetic legacy despite the terrible costs in maladaptive mutation and instability. Forces of the Terran Mandate's Perimeter agency tried to contain these researches, but often were simply too few and too poorly supported to do more than report on events.

The Golden Age of Man was already strained by the pressures of these squabbling worlds and a Mandate grown senile. Its deathblow was yet to come.

## The Scream and the Silence

In 2665 a massive wave of metadimensional energy washed over human space. Spike drive craft in metaspace were annihilated instantly, and in the blink of an eye, every psychic in human space immediately suffered the consequences of catastrophic psychic burnout. The majority died instantly, with the handful that remained raving in the grip of incurable madness.

Later reconstruction placed the origin of this “Scream” somewhere in the Veil Nebula, but no records exist of any successful investigation. Too much collapsed too quickly for any sort of exploratory expedition to be sent. Humanity was suddenly stripped of every psychic resource. Without living mentors, new generations of psychics could not be trained without recreating the entire laborious research corpus of the now-erased Psionic Authority. It would take generations to mold functional mentors out of the untrained mass of native psychics.

There was no time to recreate the necessary training. The Jump Gates were dead, and the core worlds of human space collapsed with them. Countless colonies that relied on the bulk produce of agricultural worlds were left starving within months, their shipyards overrun by the desperate and ruined in the convulsive fighting over the few remaining spike drive ships. There was no possible way to feed a world of millions with the limited freight capacity of spike drive ships; only the Jump Gates and their massive slowboat freighters could move such masses of cargo, and the slowboats were too big to be retrofitted with spike drives&hellip; even if they could cross the stars quickly enough to make a difference, which they could not.

Echoes of the disaster rippled outward. The frontier regions were still too poor and primitive to afford Jump Gates, so the worlds that remained on the edge of human space were forced to supply their own population with food and other necessities. Some of these worlds relied on small shipments of vital supplies from the core worlds. These luckless planets died when their motherworlds perished. Others were more self-reliant, but few of these had the necessary resources to build spike drive ships of their own. Those few worlds that were able to construct the ships struggled as their psitech became useless and their shipments of vital core world components stopped.

Human space had collapsed into a welter of isolated worlds. Interstellar travel fell to the handful of spike drive ships that could be kept running on scavenged components and half-derelict spaceyards. The Silence had begun.

## The Silence Ends

For almost six hundred years, humanity has been slowly recovering from the consequences of the Scream. Many frontier worlds have collapsed into barbarism and balkanized warfare. These “lost worlds” have sufficient resources for agriculture and life, but lack the fossil fuels or radioactives necessary to bootstrap modern technology. Some have even forgotten their origins or have had them obscured in the haze of legend and myth.

Other worlds have been more fortunate. These planets have been lucky enough to have the resources necessary to sustain a rough and ready level of technology. Their fusion plants are bulkier than the pretech that existed before the Scream, their spike drive engines are slower and more unstable, and the medical technology is working well if it can give the population even a hundred years of good health before death claims them. Still, these worlds have managed to devise methods for doing without the esoteric disciplines of the psychic fabricators and are slowly ramping up their production of spike drive ships as their techniques improve. This “postech” may be inferior, but after the Silence it can be replicated in a way that pretech cannot.

A few worlds have even managed to rediscover the basic techniques of psychic mentorship. The fabulously subtle and sophisticated disciplines necessary for recreating the old pretech manufactories are still long-lost, but these new academies are at least able to teach their students how to channel their powers in relatively safe and useful ways. Some worlds guard these secrets jealously, but others make substantial profit out of training foreign psychics sent by neighboring worlds. A few academies operate without any governmental supervision at all, willingly teaching their secrets to anyone with the money or a compatible ideology.

Stellar domains have begun to form around the most powerful worlds. Projecting more than a few tens of thousands of troops to a neighboring world is far beyond the abilities of most planets, so these domains tend to be loose confederacies of like-minded worlds, or else sparsely-populated colonies held under the ruthless control of a vastly larger and more powerful neighbor. Most of these domains are held together by a glue of ideology and trade benefits, and border skirmishes are becoming more common between rival space empires.

The alien neighbors of humanity have not been idle during the Silence. The Scream appears to have affected psychically-active races as badly as the humans were wounded, but those species that were not so vulnerable have expanded into human space at several points on the frontier. Some have even gone so far as to seize human worlds for their own. In a few unfortunate regions of human space, entire sectors have been conquered by alien powers.

Now, in the year 3200, the fragile web of interstellar commerce and exploration has been reformed. Countless worlds remain locked in the darkness of the Silence, awaiting the bold merchants or reckless explorers willing to return them to the embrace of interstellar humanity. And if these brave souls should be rewarded with the ancient wealth in salvage and data so long trapped on these worlds, who is to say that they do not deserve it?

## A TIMELINE OF THE FUTURE

- ***2108:*** The spike drive is discovered by crank scientist Dr. Tiberius Crohn. Humanity moves almost overnight from a handful of science stations on the solar system's inner worlds to all-out interstellar exploration. Numerous Terran governments seek the resources of new worlds.

- ***2110:*** Several scout craft are lost while learning the limits of the spike drive. The dangers of excessive frequency climbing are recorded by survivors.

- ***2113:*** The first habitable extrasolar world is discovered by the scout ship *Magellan*. The ship's patrons promptly claim the world for Greater Europe and name it Renaissance.

- ***2120:*** Pranashakti, the first life-bearing alien world, is discovered by a Pan-Indian scout ship. The organisms consist solely of plant analogues and some primitive marine life, but a generation of xenobiologists finds work in analyzing it all.

- ***2130:*** The development of asteroid mining technology provides vast amounts of raw materials to Earth's orbital shipyards and factories. Ship prices plunge, and numerous smaller organizations and states become capable of stellar exploration.

- ***2150:*** The ruins of an advanced alien species are discovered on Typhon, an otherwise unremarkable gas giant moon. Archaeologists date the ruins to approximately 40,000 BCE. Dubbed “the Watchers” for the eye-like circular motifs on the ruins, few details are learned about the species.

- ***2200:*** The First Wave of human expansion reaches its peak. Most habitable planets within a year's travel time from Earth have been successfully colonized, many by small religious or ideological groups. Terran nations begin to forbid further exploration for fear of being unable to maintain control over their offworld colonies over such distances. The Terran Mandate is organized by Earth's superpowers in order to ensure that Terran control of the colonies continues.

- ***2240:*** “Metadimensional Extroversion Syn drome” begins to manifest in certain fifth-generation spacers. Occurring most often around puberty, the abilities exhibited by MES victims seem flatly impossible by normal scientific measure: telepathy, teleportation, precognitive flashes, and other abilities that defy understanding. The syndrome is inevitably fatal unless the victim avoids all use of their uncanny abilities.

- ***2260:*** Some colony worlds begin to grow restive, and there are incidents of skirmishing and piracy on the frontier. Few disputes are over resources, but ideological and religious conflicts become more common. The Terran Mandate struggles to deal with the twelvemonth message delay between Earth and the farthest colony worlds.

- ***2275:*** Researchers on several deep-space colonies begin to develop methods for controlling the advance of MES, allowing its victims to use their abilities without inflicting permanent brain damage on themselves. The lives lost in this research are never fully numbered, but Terran governments rapidly move to control the research and training under the aegis of the “Psionic Authority”.

- ***2280:*** Properly-trained MES carriers, known commonly as “psychics”,or more casually, as “Messes”, begin to use their abilities to assist governments and private enterprise. Numerous fields begin to benefit from the assistance of MES subjects, ranging from telepathic mental health providers to precognitive industrial managers. The Psionic Authority begins to experiment with more focused, industrially-useful psionic disciplines. Again, the cost in lives is undisclosed.

- ***2315:*** The Psionic Authority perfects the first jump gate. A massive ring of psitech placed at the periphery of the solar system, the gate employs a choir of over fifty master teleporters to instantly translate ships to a matching gate at Renaissance. Gate dispersal is slowed by a lack of master teleporters, but eventually the transit time between Earth and the frontier is reduced to two days. The Earth nations lift the ban on further exploration now that their effective control is enhanced.

- ***2330:*** The Second Wave of human colonization begins. Spike drive ships become all but unknown within the core worlds as the jump gates allow cheaper system ships to travel between the older colonies.

- ***2350:*** Psitech-enhanced manufactory abilities and precognitive surveyors vastly increase the rate of viable colonization. Almost two billion humans leave Earth for the wealth and freedom of the colony worlds. The Terran Mandate begins to realize that they now lack the manpower necessary to maintain control over so many colonies, even with the reduced transit time.

- ***2400:*** Obedience to Terran governments is now a polite fiction on the frontier, in those cases when it is acknowledged at all. The first stellar unions begin to form. Some neighboring worlds resort to war, but most colonists see no need for fighting with so many unexploited resources.

- ***2425:*** The Terran Mandate has become deeply corrupt and hopelessly decadent. Its Directors concern themselves exclusively with their own interests, rivalries, and ideological obsessions. Only the AI Maestros of Earth act as a check on their actions, as the Directors are unable to effectively control the Mandate without the help of their AI adjuncts. These AIs struggle to maintain a basic level of probity among their creators.

- ***2450:*** The Second Wave is at its peak; it is the Golden Age of Man. The Terran Mandate has largely given up on exerting control over the frontier colonies, and now concentrates simply on neutralizing threats to the core worlds. Every description of human civilization and ideology can be found somewhere in human space, and cultures experiment with new forms of social organization. Psitech supplements normal technology to produce enormous abundance for even the poorest worlds with access to core technology.

- ***2460:*** Human gengineering becomes common on some worlds as societies attempt to improve their members. Advances in longevity and health spread widely, but attempts to significantly improve human capabilities invariably bring serious drawbacks from system strain and unanticipated side effects. Still, some of the more zealous cultures are willing to accept these consequences in pursuit of the “perfect human”.

- ***2500:*** Jump Gates begin to reach the frontier. Major systems are the first to receive them, while most of the minor worlds are still reliant on spike drive ships. The furthest reaches of the frontier now extend ten years of spike drive travel from Earth. Population growth levels off and begins to decline with the increasing wealth of the colonies and their progressive self-absorption.

- ***2550:*** Certain remote sectors of space have begun to embrace both gengineering and advanced AI integration to recreate humanity in ways more suitable to local ambitions. Some of these sectors continue to interact with their baseline human neighbors, while other transhumans are dangerously aggressive in their proselytization.

- ***2600:*** Spike drive ships are now somewhat antiquated, serving a vastly reduced exploratory effort and as militia ships for the defense of local systems. Almost all core systems of importance are now linked with jump gates. Psitech has permeated even very basic technology on these worlds. Large-scale war between worlds is almost unknown.

- ***2665:*** The Scream erupts from somewhere within the Veil Nebula. Reconstructions of the event suggest that it was some form of faster-than-light psychic emanation, the wave propagating from one end of human space to the other within seventeen minutes. The Scream inevitably rendered a psychic either dead or hopelessly insane. The Jump Gate network collapses. A period of stellar isolation and chaos begins, now commonly called “the Silence”.

- ***2665:*** On Earth, the maddened arch-psions known as the Crazed annihilate the planet's infrastructure, destroy many AI Maestros, and pervert the Highshine nanite recovery system. The solar system's defense grid is activated and made universally hostile to all starships. Earth vanishes from all surviving records, its present condition unknown.

- ***2700:*** Countless core worlds die as they are cut off from vital food and technical supplies. Psitech manufactories are crippled, and only a relative handful of spike drive ships can be fabricated before the industrial base erodes. These ships band together for security while searching for resupply and become the progenitors of today's Scavenger Fleets.

- ***2705:*** Frontier worlds fare better than core planets. More spike drive ships are available, and those worlds that have yet to receive Jump Gates were still devoting effort to autonomous agriculture and industry. Even so, the sudden loss of every human psychic leaves their psitech equipment and industries largely useless. Many frontier worlds devolve to survival-level subsistence.

- ***2710:*** The last easily-salvaged remnants of Mandate pretech begin to wear out or become used up. The most useful or effective tech was often explicitly designed to be irreplaceable by frontier worlds in order to maintain the Mandate core's monopoly on the technology. With the core worlds dead or consumed by struggle, this technology can now be found only in lost caches and Mandate ruins. Some worlds go to desperate extremes to maintain vital pretech infrastructure, utilizing dangerous methods or unstable repurposed tech.

- ***2900:*** Attempts are made to recover the techniques of psychic training. The complete absence of any experienced psychic trainers hampers this effort, and the cost in psychic lives to recreate this training is enormous. A few worlds are successful in developing crude training programs, but most societies abandon the effort in the face of more immediate planetary needs.

- ***3050:*** The Silence starts to lift. Those worlds that did not experience a terminal collapse after the Scream finally begin to perfect techniques of large-scale manufacturing that do not rely on psitech. Even the most sophisticated training programs can no longer replicate the narrow and esoteric talents of pre-Silence psychic fabricators.

- ***3100:*** Spike drive ships begin the remapping of drill courses between stars. With almost five centuries of neglect, the pre-Silence rutters have become useless. The steady shifting of dimensional layers has rendered old course soundings dangerously inaccurate. All of the drill courses must be rediscovered through trial and potentially fatal error. Few Scavenger Fleets cooperate in sharing their course data due to fears of competition.

- ***3150:*** Stellar unions start to form around the strongest worlds. Exploration continues, often in the hands of small traders and scout crews who are willing to risk all for the chance to open a route to an unplundered tomb world. Warfare erupts between unions contesting control over lost worlds and space installations.

- ***3200:*** The present day.

# SECTOR CREATION

Every self-respecting sci-fi game needs to be able to provide a stock of interesting alien worlds. Even if a campaign should happen to take place largely on a single world, the backdrop of foreign spheres adds context and additional adventure hooks to the game.

Most campaigns are going to involve substantial world-hopping, however, and the GM needs to be ready to deal with this. This chapter will give you the tools you need to fashion a sector of the void that will be worth the reckless daring of a band of heroic PCs.

## The Nature of Sectors

In the former days of the Mandate, human space was generally divided into administrative sectors, each one the particular responsibility of some fragment of the ancient Terran bureaucracy. By the end of the Second Wave, these responsibilities were almost entirely fictitious, as the Mandate Fleet lacked the manpower necessary to exert Old Earth's will on its scattered progeny. Even so, the centuries-old grind of bureaucratic procedure still dutifully labeled each fragment of distant space with its own identity.

Sectors were established on the basis of metadimensional proximity rather than simple spatial propinquity. Individual stars in a sector might be spread out over dozens of light years, but the metadimensional currents between them were strong enough to allow quick travel among them, when a physically-neighboring star might require impossibly lengthy drills through metadimensional space to reach it.

Settlers in these far sectors often adopted Mandate sector nomenclature simply out of convenience. The sectors that Fleet scout ships and far trader adventurers mapped out were composed of stars “close” enough to allow for trade with their ramshackle spike drives and colonial cargo haulers, and their density allowed for trade and assistance between nearby friendly worlds. Those with a more isolationist bent sought out sectors with far-scattered stars that couldn't be bridged by the less sophisticated drives that most colonists used.

Most sectors had limited contact with other regions of space. While “bordering” stars could sometimes allow drills into a neighboring sector, large patches of unfriendly metadimensional space often strictly limited the available paths into or out of a sector. Some sectors were entirely inaccessible by anything but top-grade Mandate spike drives capable of leaping the broad gaps around them, and some entire regions were isolated by a few narrow bridgepoints into the cluster.

As a consequence, modern human space varies wildly in every respect. Some regions have sophisticated interstellar trade and wide-reaching empires, while others are struggling to rise from primitive barbarism. A lost bridgepoint can separate whole empires, leaving both entirely ignorant of each other&hellip;for the moment.

## Sectors In Your Game

From a campaign perspective, sectors limit the scope of material you need to take into account in your game. While it's perfectly possible to run a game with multiple interconnected sectors, the sheer bulk of worlds can make that a painful prospect for most GMs. A single sector of 21-30 worlds is more than enough for most parties to explore.

Sectors and interstellar regions also provide you with a convenient explanation for running dramatically different campaigns. Players who want to run a space-operatic game set in a region of easy spaceflight and consistent high-tech marvels can do so, while a group that wants a harder scifi experience in a sector without psionic powers or exotic energy weapons can have their play as well. The vast sweep of human space has room for your preferred tropes without having to fight the setting. No matter what you want to play, there's *some* chunk of human space that has it.

A sector provides the basic background for the adventures the PCs encounter, as every world needs to have some kind of adventure-worthy content if it's to justify its drain on a GM's creativity and focus. Creating worlds purely for pleasure or aesthetic satisfaction is entirely valid, but as a working GM, you also need material you can *play*. This chapter will show you how to maximize the return on your effort, and get the most playable content out of the least amount of work.

This is a necessity in any system, but it is especially important if you're going to be running a sandbox game. A GM who tries to flesh out every nook and cranny of the dozens of worlds they create will be rapidly exhausted by the effort, and might still lack the content they need to actually run a game during the next session of play. A GM needs to have a plan and an appropriate set of tools if they are to deal with the challenge in a comfortable, straightforward way.

When building a sector, you can generally assume that it's isolated from any neighboring regions. There might be a few connections along the “borders” of the sector, still-remembered spike drive paths into the next collection of worlds, but you've got enough to build if you just focus on a single sector at a time.

You are advised to carefully read the following pages and take heed of the advice on how much content you should create for each world. A GM would not be a GM if they did not take pleasure in creating wondrous new worlds to explore, but the most enthusiastic demiurge still has a limited amount of creative energy, time, and focus to spend on a campaign. If you follow the steps in the following pages, you'll be able to ensure a playable amount of gaming content for your next session before you start spending your effort on more decorative elements of your creation.

## Creating a Stellar Sector

Once you've decided to forge your own piece of the infinite void, you'll want to grab a sheet of largehex hex paper from one of the many templates available online. First you'll make a stellar map of the sector on this sheet, and then you'll individually flesh out the worlds to whatever degree of fineness your needs require.

One crucial thing to remember at this stage of creation is that *you do not have to create everything*. You don't need to answer every question about the sector or have every world in adventure-ready condition. Right now you're just laying down broad strokes and rough colors to the sector, and when it comes time to do detail work you'll save it for the worlds that matter most to your immediate needs.

Every GM has a limited supply of time, energy, and creative inspiration. If you try to fabricate an entire complete sector in one go, with interesting planets and meaningful interstellar intrigue and easy adventure hooks all over the place, you're likely to exhaust yourself before you even get to play.

Instead, you should follow a simple guiding principle whenever building anything for your campaign, whether a stellar sector or an adventure outline.

***Am I having fun?*** If you're enjoying yourself, then you can keep building. We follow this hobby because it's fun, and if you're enjoying the process then you should let yourself have your indulgence.

***Am I going to need this for the next session?*** If what you're creating is something you know you're going to need for the next game session, then you should finish it. Don't let this feeling of obligation extend to every detail, however; it can be easy to imagine situations where you'll need to elaborate some NPC or organization or location, but if you respond to every such possibility you'll never get away from the drawing board.

If you're not having fun and you don't need it for your next game session, *stop it*. You're going to exhaust yourself on minutiae and trivia and not have the energy to do the parts you really do need, or the vigor needed to actually run this for the group.

With that principle kept firmly in mind, it's time to start building the sector.

## Place the Stars

The standard sector map is a grid of hexagons 8 wide by 10 high, with hex templates easily acquired from the net. Roll 1d10 and add 20 to determine the total number of stars in the sector, or simply choose a number that suits.

For the first twenty or so stars, roll 1d8 and 1d10 together to determine the column and row in which to place the star. If the hex is already occupied, place it adjacent in the direction of the nearest edge.

Some columns have “half-hexes” in them, and only 9 full hexes; if you roll a 10 for such a column, either reroll or place it at the bottom-most full hex.

Once you've placed the randomly-positioned stars, add the remainder to connect any stellar clumps or groupings. Remember that standard postech spike drives can't reach more than 3 hexes, so any cluster that can't be reached with such a drill will be inaccessible to anything but pretech-grade drives.

The stellar map you've just created is an abstraction, one reflecting the eddies and currents of metadimensional space. The individual stars might look adjacent on the map, but some may be vast distances apart. If you'd prefer to use more realistic star maps, you can grab some three-dimensional star map off the web and convert a convenient number of light years into a single “hex” of distance for spike drive purposes.

## Lay Down the Primary Worlds

With the stars placed, it's time to place the primary inhabited worlds. While it's possible to declare that a star is orbited only by barren rocks, such stars are more difficult to make useful as places of adventure and gameable fun.

Right now, assume that each inhabited system has a single primary world. The original colonists would have naturally sought out the best, most habitable world for their founding. As a consequence, however nasty the primary world is, the others in the system are probably even worse. If you wish to add additional planets to the system later, you can do so, but for now you'll want to focus on just one.

Start by rolling two world tags for each planet. World tags are simple tropes that reflect the most important qualities about the world, or at least those qualities most important to adventurers. A list of a hundred potential world tags starts here.

It's most convenient to roll world tags for each planet before moving on to the other elements of the world, so you spend less time flipping back and forth between the sections. Don't worry about making the tags make sense yet. Just note them down and go on.

Next, roll the atmospheres for each world. In this and the following steps, you can either reroll results that make no sense in light of the world tags you've generated, or simply pick a result that fits. If you're feeling more adventurous, however, you can try to think of an explanation that reconciles seemingly incommensurate results.

After you roll atmospheres for each planet, repeat the process for temperature, biosphere, population, and tech level. Optionally, you can go on to add additional planets or points of interest to each system.

Finally, tack on a name for the planet and give it a sentence worth of description. You don't need to flesh it out fully right now. Just note down whatever rough idea of it comes to mind from its world tags, population, and other planetary qualities.

## Mark Polities and Trade Routes

Identify the star systems that are in contact with each other and draw lines of communication between them. Remember that any gap of 4 or more hexes can't be crossed without pretech spike drives, so any contact between distant clusters will have to be through an intermediate world.

Worlds in contact with each other may not necessarily be friendly, but they do know about each other and have at least a basic understanding of local conditions. Some provision is usually made for foreign visitors from these other worlds, even if it's nothing more than a strictly-monitored starport housing unit.

If two or more planets seem like they ought to belong to the same interstellar polity, sketch out a “border” around the grouping. Most TL4 worlds would be very hard-pressed to mount an effective interstellar invasion of a peer world, so these polities have likely formed out of diplomatic or cultural ties, or consist of a local hegemon exerting its rule over planets too weak or primitive to resist their influence.

Many sectors will have no multi-system governments of any kind. The individual worlds might be too independent, or the recovery of spaceflight technology may have been too recent to allow for ties of mutual governance to form yet. Such disjointed sectors can make life easier for the typical band of PCs, as escape into a new system means escape from the legal jurisdiction of a world they may have recently offended.

## Build Out the Important Worlds

Most of the worlds in your sector don't need anything more than what you've already given them. A few worlds need more elaborate detail, however, and for these you'll want to make use of a separate planetary record sheet for the world.

Only detail worlds that you're going to need for the next session. In this case, that means you should detail the world that the campaign starts on and those worlds that the PCs might end up traveling to at the end of the first session. For most purposes, this just means the starting world and its immediate neighbors.

First, pick a rough cultural template for the world. Maybe it has a Latin American flavor, or was founded by Russian colonists, or was an outpost of Byzantine Empire enthusiasts. This culture has doubtless changed drastically since its initial founding, but it gives you a baseline for assigning names to people and places, identifying the common language spoken on the planet, and giving you enough information to describe local foods, architectural styles, and small slice-of-life elements.

You can always take the time to create an entirely new hybrid culture, but whatever you make or choose should be clear enough in your mind to let you give quick answers to sudden questions about cultural values or local habits. Again, it's not critical to worry about historical accuracy; these worlds have had centuries to form their own worldviews and local customs.

Next, use the world tags to create adventure components. Each tag includes different example Enemies, Friends, Complications, Things, and Places. Take an Enemy from both world tags or create one for each, and merge them together into a single antagonist. Thus, a *Feral World* with *Heavy Industry* might have a cannibal oligarch who literally lives on the flesh and blood of his slave laborers. Give this Enemy a name and a sentence of description.

Repeat the process for a Friend, a Complication, a Thing, and a Place. You don't necessarily need to use both tags in every instance, and you'll likely want to make up your own components inspired by the tags, but you should have at least one item in each category written down on the planetary record. You'll use these raw elements later to create a starting adventure for your band of star-faring freebooters.

Lastly, take a few minutes to answer some critical questions about the planet, noting the answers down in the cultural section of the sheet.

What does this world have that the PCs might care about? Does it export a valuable and portable commodity, or provide a special tech, or have unique job opportunities for expendable offworlder adventurers?

What is the biggest conflict on the world right now? Is it a social struggle between classes, tension with offworlder merchants or visitors, a war going on among local governments, or some other big crisis? Every world should have at least one obvious conflict that the PCs might choose to engage or be pulled into.

What do they think about outsiders? Are they comfortable with offworlders, do they view them with unusual mistrust, or are they outright xenophobic?

What is law enforcement like? Are there special laws that might tangle the PCs? If the PCs break a law, what kind of enforcement can they expect?

Where do the PCs land? What's the name of the major starport on the world, and does the starport have any special deficiencies or unique opportunities?

You can flesh out a world beyond these questions if you wish, but they provide a bare minimum of data.

## Choose Factions and Relations

Lastly, look at what you've created and determine the relationships between the starting world and its neighbors. Also, decide on the relationships between any polities you've established. Open interstellar warfare is very hard for a lone TL4 world to sustain, but a powerful planet or combine might be able to do it. More likely are cold wars of spies and saboteurs.

You may decide to establish one or more Factions to help give some independent motion to the sector's background. Two or three Factions are plenty for the start of a campaign, and you should feel free to make new ones or let old ones fall inactive as the game progresses. Rules for Factions start here.

And with that, your sector is ready for play. The Adventure Creation chapter gives the next step.

## Assigning World Tags

The first step in world creation, and perhaps the most important, lies in assigning “tags” to the world. Tags are brief conceptual tropes that set the world off from planets of otherwise similar population and characteristics. You can either pick from the tag table to select qualities that sound interesting for a world, or else roll percentile dice to select them randomly.

In general, you should pick or roll two tags for any given world. Using a single tag can leave a planet feeling somewhat flat and one-dimensional, while using three or more can end up muddying the feel of the world. The goal of the tags is not to automatically combine into some intricately sophisticated world model, but to provide some clear, bright elements to relate to the PCs. Tags can randomly give you “desert planet torn by civil war”, from which you can then create “an arid world riven by factional disputes between fragmented clans, the families based around ownership of irreplaceable pre-Scream moisture collectors”.

Tags are meant to simplify your life as a GM. They provide quick, simple hooks for adventure and cultural characterization to help distinguish the myriad worlds of your campaign from each other.

Each tag includes associated entries for ***Enemies***, ***Friends***, ***Complications***, - ***Things***, and ***Places*** that fit with that tag. GMs can combine the elements of the two tags to create ones flavored specifically for that world. For example, two random tags for a world might be “Regional Hegemon” and “Psionics Fear”. Combining the “Colonial Official” and “Mental Purity Investigator” entries from the enemies lists of those tags, we come up with Heinrich Stalt, Imperial Mind Proctor, a grim inquisitor dispatched to the worlds under Imperial “protection” to purge them of the awful curse of psionically-active monsters.

These NPCs, objects, places, and situations can be used as raw grist for generating your adventures or be slotted into the scenario seeds provided later in the Adventure Generation chapter. Of course, not every Enemy will be intrinsically hostile to the PCs, nor every Friend necessarily a sympathetic figure.

Naturally, you should feel free to come up with your own tags as well. Almost any science-fiction trope that you enjoy can be turned into a tag, and characteristic elements can be blended into the list of raw adventure components.

## Abandoned Colony

The world once hosted a colony, whether human or otherwise, until some crisis or natural disaster drove the inhabitants away or killed them off. The colony might have been mercantile in nature, an expedition to extract valuable local resources, or it might have been a reclusive cabal of zealots. The remains of the colony are usually in ruins, and might still be dangerous from the aftermath of whatever destroyed it in the first place.

### Enemies

Crazed survivors, Ruthless plunderers of the ruins, Automated defense system

### Friends

Inquisitive stellar archaeologist, Heir to the colony's property, Local wanting the place cleaned out and made safe

### Complications

The local government wants the ruins to remain a secret, The locals claim ownership of it, The colony is crumbling and dangerous to navigate

### Things

Long-lost property deeds, Relic stolen by the colonists when they left, Historical record of the colonization attempt

### Places

Decaying habitation block, Vine-covered town square, Structure buried by an ancient landslide

## Altered Humanity

The humans on this world are visibly and drastically different from normal humanity. They may have additional limbs, new sensory organs, or other significant changes. Were these from ancestral eugenic manipulation, strange stellar mutations, or from an environmental toxin unique to this world?

### Enemies

Biochauvinist local, Local experimenter, Mentally unstable mutant

### Friends

Local seeking a “cure”, Curious xenophiliac, Anthropological researcher

### Complications

survival, Locals fear and mistrust non-local humans

### Places

Abandoned eugenics laboratory, An environment requiring the mutation for survival, A sacred site where the first local was transformed

## Alien Ruins

The world has significant alien ruins present. The locals may or may not permit others to investigate the ruins, and may make it difficult to remove any objects of value without substantial payment. Any surviving ruins with worthwhile salvage almost certainly have some defense or hazard to explain their unplundered state.

### Enemies

Customs inspector, Worshipper of the ruins, Hidden alien survivor

### Friends

Curious scholar, Avaricious local resident, Interstellar smuggler

### Complications

Traps in the ruins, Remote location, Paranoid customs officials

### Things

Precious alien artifacts, Objects left with the remains of a prior unsuccessful expedition, Untranslated alien texts, Untouched hidden ruins

### Places

Undersea ruin, Orbital ruin, Perfectly preserved alien building, Alien mausoleum

## Anarchists
 Rather than being an incidental anarchy of struggling tribes and warring factions, this world actually has a functional society with no centralized authority. Authority might be hyper-localized to extended families, specific religious parishes, or voluntary associations. Some force is preventing an outside group or internal malcontents from coalescing into a power capable of imposing its rule on the locals; this force might be an ancient pretech defense system, a benevolent military AI, or the sheer obscurity and isolation of the culture.

### Enemies

Offworlder imperialist, Reformer seeking to impose “good government”, Exploiter taking advantage of the lack of centralized resistance

### Friends

Proud missionary for anarchy, Casual local free spirit, Curious offworlder political scientist

### Complications

The anarchistic structure is compelled by an external power, The anarchy is enabled by currently abundant resources, The protecting force that shelters the anarchy is waning

### Things

A macguffin that would let the possessor enforce their rule on others, A vital resource needed to preserve general liberty, Tech forbidden as disruptive to the social order

### Places

Community of similar-sized homes, Isolated clan homestead, Automated mining site

## Anthropomorphs

The locals were originally human, but at some point became anthropomorphic, either as an ancient furry colony, a group of animal-worshiping sectarians, or gengineers who just happened to find animal elements most convenient for surviving on the world. Depending on the skill of the original gengineers, their feral forms may or may not work as well as their original human bodies, or may come with drawbacks inherited from their animal elements.

### Enemies

Anthro-supremacist local, Native driven by feral urges, Outside exploiter who sees the locals as subhuman creatures

### Friends

Fascinated genetic researcher, Diplomat trained to deal with normals, Local needing outside help

### Complications

The locals consider their shapes a curse from their foolish ancestors, Society is ordered according to animal forms, The locals view normal humans as repulsive or inferior

### Things

Pretech gengineering tech, A “cure” that may not be wanted, Sacred feral totem

### Places

Shrine to a feral deity, Nature preserve suited to an animal type, Living site built to take advantage of animal traits

## Area 51

The world's government is fully aware of their local stellar neighbors, but the common populace has no idea about it- and the government means to keep it that way. Trade with government officials in remote locations is possible, but any attempt to clue the commoners in on the truth will be met with lethal reprisals.

### Enemies

Suspicious government minder, Free merchant who likes his local monopoly, Local who wants a specimen for dissection

### Friends

Crusading offworld investigator, Conspiracy-theorist local, Idealistic government reformer

### Complications

The government has a good reason to keep the truth concealed, The government ruthlessly oppresses the natives, The government is actually composed of offworlders

### Things

Elaborate spy devices, Memory erasure tech, Possessions of the last offworlder who decided to spread the truth

### Places

Desert airfield, Deep subterranean bunker, Hidden mountain valley

## Badlands World
 Whatever the original climate and atmosphere type, something horrible happened to this world. Biological, chemical, or nanotechnical weaponry has reduced it to a wretched hellscape. Some local life might still be able to survive on its blasted surface, usually at some dire cost in health or humanity.

### Enemies

Mutated badlands fauna, Desperate local, Badlands raider chief

### Friends

Native desperately wishing to escape the world, Scientist researching ecological repair methods, Ruin scavenger

### Complications

Radioactivity, Bioweapon traces, Broken terrain, Sudden local plague

### Things

Maltech research core, Functional pretech weaponry, An uncontaminated well

### Places

Untouched oasis, Ruined city, Salt flat

## Beastmasters

The natives have extremely close bonds with the local fauna, possibly having special means of communication and control through tech or gengineering. Local animal life plays a major role in their society, industry, or warfare, and new kinds of beasts may be bred to suit their purposes.

### Enemies

Half-feral warlord of a beast swarm, Coldly inhuman scientist, Altered beast with human intellect and furious malice

### Friends

Native bonded with an adorable animal, Herder of very useful beasts, Animal-revering mystic

### Complications

The “animals” are very heavily gengineered humans, The animals actually run the society, The animals have the same rights as humans

### Things

Tech used to alter animal life, A plague vial that could wipe out the animals, A pretech device that can perform a wonder if operated by a beast

### Places

Park designed as a comfortable home for beasts, Public plaza designed to accommodate animal companions, Factory full of animal workers

## Battleground

The world is a battleground for two or more outside powers. They may be interstellar rivals, or groups operating out of orbitals or other system bodies. Something about the planet is valuable enough for them to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be anything but animate obstacles to the fight.

### Enemies

Ruthless military commander, Looter pack chieftain, Traitorous collaborator

### Friends

Native desperately seeking protection, Pragmatic military officer, Hapless war orphan

### Complications

The war just ended as both sides are leaving, The natives somehow brought this on themselves, A small group of natives profit tremendously from the fighting

### Things

A cache of the resource the invaders seek, Abandoned prototype military gear, Precious spy intelligence lost by someone

### Places

Artillery-pocked wasteland, Reeking refugee camp, Burnt-out shell of a city

## Bubble Cities

Whether due to a lack of atmosphere or an uninhabitable climate, the world's cities exist within domes or pressurized buildings. In such sealed environments, techniques of surveillance and control can grow baroque and extreme.

### Enemies

Native dreading outsider contamination, Saboteur from another bubble city, Local official hostile to outsider ignorance of laws

### Friends

Local rebel against the city officials, Maintenance chief in need of help, Surveyor seeking new building sites

### Complications

Bubble rupture, Failing atmosphere reprocessor, Native revolt against officials, All-seeing surveillance cameras

### Things

Pretech habitat technology, Valuable industrial products, Master key
codes to a city's security system

### Places

City power core, Surface of the bubble, Hydroponics complex, Warren-like hab block

## Cheap Life

Human life is near-worthless on this world. Ubiquitous cloning, local conditions that ensure early death, a culture that reveres murder, or a social structure that utterly discounts the value of most human lives ensures that death is the likely outcome for any action that irritates someone consequential.

### Enemies

Master assassin, Bloody-handed judge, Overseer of disposable clones

### Friends

Endearing local whose life the PCs accidentally bought, Escapee from death seeking outside help, Reformer trying to change local mores

### Complications

Radiation or local diseases ensure all locals die before twenty-five years of age, Tech ensures that death is just an annoyance, Locals are totally convinced of a blissful afterlife

### Things

Device that revives or re-embodies the dead, Maltech engine fueled by human life, Priceless treasure held by a now-dead owner

### Places

Thronging execution ground, extremely cursory cemetery, Factory full of lethal dangers that could be corrected easily

## Cold War

Two or more great powers control the planet, and they have a hostility to each other that's just barely less than open warfare. The hostility might be ideological in nature, or it might revolve around control of some local resource.

### Enemies

Suspicious chief of intelligence, Native who thinks the outworlders are with the other side, Femme fatale

### Friends

Apolitical information broker, Spy for the other side, Unjustly accused innocent, “He's a bastard, but he's our bastard” official

### Complications

Police sweep, Low-level skirmishing, “Red scare”

### Things

List of traitors in government, secret military plans, Huge cache of weapons built up in preparation for war

### Places

Seedy bar in a neutral area, Political rally, Isolated area where fighting is underway

## Civil War

The world is currently torn between at least two opposing factions, all of which claim legitimacy. The war may be the result of a successful rebel uprising against tyranny, or it might just be the result of schemers who plan to be the new masters once the revolution is complete.

### Enemies

Faction commissar, Angry native, Conspiracy theorist who blames offworlders for the war, Deserter looking out for himself, Guerrilla bandit chieftain

### Friends

Faction loyalist seeking aid, Native caught in the crossfire, Offworlder seeking passage off the planet

### Complications

### Things

Ammo dump, Military cache, Treasure buried for after the war, Secret war plans

### Places

Battle front, Bombed-out town, Rear-area red light zone, Propaganda broadcast tower

## Colonized Population

A neighboring world has successfully colonized this less-advanced or less-organized planet, and the natives aren't happy about it. A puppet government may exist, but all real decisions are made by the local viceroy.

### Enemies

Suspicious security personnel, worlder-hating natives, Local crime boss preying on rich offworlders

### Friends

Native resistance leader, Colonial official seeking help, Native caught between the two sides

### Complications

Natives won't talk to offworlders, Colonial repression, Misunderstood local customs

### Things

Relic of the resistance movement, List of collaborators, Precious substance extracted by colonial labor

### Places

Deep wilderness resistance camp, City district off-limits to natives, Colonial labor site

## Cultural Power

The world is a considerable cultural power in the sector, producing music, art, philosophy, or some similar intangible that their neighbors find irresistibly attractive. Other worlds might have a profound degree of cultural cachet as the inheritor of some venerable artistic tradition.

### Enemies

Murderously eccentric artist, Crazed fan, Failed artist with an obsessive grudge, Critic with a crusade to enact

### Friends

Struggling young artist, Pupil of the artistic tradition, Scholar of
the art, Offworlder hating the source of corrupting alien ways

### Complications

### Things

The instrument of a legendary master, The only copy of a dead master's opus, Proof of intellectual property ownership

### Places

Recording or performance studio, Public festival choked with tourists, Monument to a dead master of the art

## Cyborgs

The planet's population makes heavy use of cybernetics, with many of the inhabitants possessing at least a cosmetic amount of chrome. This may be the result of a strong local cyber tech base, a religious injunction, or simply a necessary measure to survive the local conditions.

### Enemies

Ambitious hacker of cyber implants, Cybertech oligarch, Researcher
craving fresh offworlders, Cybered-up gang boss

### Friends

Charity-working implant physician, Idealistic young cyber researcher, Avant-garde activist

### Places

Grimy slum chop-shop, Bloody lair of implant rippers, Stark plaza where everyone is seeing things through their augmented-re ality cyber

## Cybercommunists

On this world communism actually works, thanks to pretech computing devices and greater or lesser amounts of psychic precognition. Central planning nodes direct all production and employment on the world. Citizens in good standing have access to ample amounts of material goods for all needs and many wants. Instead of strife over wealth, conflicts erupt over political controls, cultural precepts, or control over the planning nodes. Many cybercommunist worlds show a considerable bias toward the private interests of those who run the planning nodes.

### Enemies

Embittered rebel against perceived unfairness, Offworlder saboteur, Aspiring Stalin-figure

### Friends

Idealistic planning node tech, Cynical anti-corruption cop, Precognitive economist

### Complications

The pretech planning computers are breaking down, The planning only works because the locals have been mentally or physically altered, The planning computers can't handle the increasing population within the system

### Things

Planning node computer, Wildly destabilizing commodity that can't be factored into plans, A tremendous store of valuables made by accident

### Places

Humming factory, Apartment block of per fectly equal flats, Mass demonstration of unity

## Cyclical Doom

The world regularly suffers some apocalyptic catastrophe that wipes out organized civilization on it. The local culture is aware of this cycle and has traditions to ensure a fragment of civilization survives into the next era, but these traditions don't always work properly, and sometimes dangerous fragments of the past emerge.

### Enemies

Offworlder seeking to trigger the apocalypse early for profit, Local recklessly taking advantage of preparation stores, Demagogue claiming the cycle is merely a myth of the authorities

### Friends

Harried official working to prepare, Offworlder studying the cycles, Local threatened by perils of the cycle's initial stages

### Complications

The cycles really are a myth of the authorities, The cycles are controlled by alien constructs, An outside power is interfering with preparation

### Things

A lost cache of ancient treasures, Tech or archives that will pinpoint the cycle's timing, Keycodes to bypass an ancient vault's security

### Places

Lethally-defended vault of forgotten secrets, Starport crowded with panicked refugees, Town existing in the shadow of some mon strous monument to a former upheaval

## Desert World

The world may have a breathable atmosphere and a human-tolerable temperature range, but it is an arid, stony waste outside of a few places made habitable by human effort. The deep wastes are largely unexplored and inhabited by outcasts and worse.

### Enemies

Raider chieftain, Crazed hermit, Angry isolationists, Paranoid mineral prospector, Strange desert beast

### Friends

Native guide, Research biologist, Aspiring terraformer

### Complications

Sandstorms, Water supply failure, Native warfare over water rights

### Things

### Places

Oasis, “The Empty Quarter” of the desert, Hidden underground cistern

## Dying Race

The inhabitants of this world are dying out, and they know it. Through environmental toxins, hostile bio-weapons, or sheer societal despair, the culture cannot replenish its numbers. Members seek meaning in their own strange goals or peculiar faiths, though a few might struggle to find some way to reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.

### Enemies

Hostile outsider who wants the locals dead, Offworlder seeking to take advantage of their weakened state, Invaders eager to push the locals out of their former lands

### Friends

One of the few youth among the population, Determined and hopeful reformer, Researcher seeking a new method of reproduction

### Complications

The dying culture's values were monstrous, The race's death is somehow necessary to prevent some grand catastrophe, The race is somehow convinced they deserve this fate

### Things

Extremely valuable reproductive tech, Treasured artifacts of the former age, Bioweapon used on the race

### Places

City streets devoid of pedestrians, Mighty edifice now crumbling with disrepair, Small dwelling full of people in a town now otherwise empty

## Doomed World

The world is doomed, and the locals may or may not know it. Some cosmic catastrophe looms before them, and the locals have no realistic way to get everyone to safety. To the extent that the public is aware, society is disintegrating into a combination of religious fervor, abject hedonism, and savage violence.

### Enemies

## Fallen Hegemon

At some point in the past, this world was a hegemonic power over some or all of the sector, thanks to superior tech, expert diplomacy, the weakness of their neighbors, or inherited Mandate legitimacy. Some kind of crash or revolt broke their power, however, and now the world is littered with the wreckage of former glory.

### Enemies

Bitter pretender to a meaningless throne, Resentful official dreaming of empire, Vengeful offworlder seeking to punish their old rulers

## Feral World

In the long, isolated night of the Silence, some worlds have experienced total moral and cultural collapse. Whatever remains has been twisted beyond recognition into assorted death cults, xenophobic fanaticism, horrific cultural practices, or other behavior unacceptable on more enlightened worlds. These worlds are almost invariably quarantined by other planets.

### Enemies

Decadent noble, Mad cultist, Xenophobic local, Cannibal chief, Maltech researcher

### Places

A bustling work site, Ancestral worker housing, Local community made only semi-livable by the demands of the work

## Heavy Industry

With interstellar transport so limited in the bulk it can move, worlds have to be largely self-sufficient in industry. Some worlds are more sufficient than others, however, and this planet has a thriving manufacturing sector capable of producing large amounts of goods appropriate to its tech level. The locals may enjoy a correspondingly higher lifestyle, or the products might be devoted towards vast projects for the aggrandizement of the rulers.

### Enemies

Tycoon monopolist, Industrial spy, Malcontent revolutionary

### Friends

Natives of this world exist in a kind of mental gestalt, sharing thoughts and partaking of a single identity. Powerful pretech, exotic psionics, alien influence, or some other cause has left the world sharing one identity. Individual members may have greater or lesser degrees of effective coordination with the whole.

### Enemies

A hivemind that wants to assimilate outsiders, A hivemind that has no respect for unjoined life, A hivemind that fears and hates unjoined life

Natives of this world are effectively immortal. They may have been gengineered for tremendous lifespans, or have found some local anagathic, or be cyborg life forms, or be so totally convinced of reincarnation that death is a cultural irrelevance. Any immortality technique is likely applicable only to them, or else it's apt to be a massive draw to outside imperialists.

### Enemies

Outsider determined to steal immortality, Smug local convinced of their immortal wisdom to rule all, Offworlder seeking the world's ruin before it becomes a threat to all

### Friends

Curious longevity researcher, Thrill-seeking local,

### Enemies

Corrupt test administrator, Incompetent but highly-rated graduate, Ruthless leader of a clan of high-testing relations

### Friends

Crusader for test reform, Talented but poorly-connected graduate, Genius who tests badly

This cannibalism plays a major role in their society.

### Enemies

Ruthless ghoul leader, Chieftain of a ravenous tribe, Sophisticated degenerate preaching the splendid authenticity of cannibalism

### Enemies

Deranged Mandate monitoring AI, Aspiring sector ruler, Demagogue preaching local superiority over “traitorous rebel worlds”.

### Friends

Idealistic do-gooder local, Missionary for advanced Mandate tech, Outsider seeking lost data from Mandate records

### Places

Faded Mandate offices still in use, Vault containing ancient pretech, Carefully-maintained monument to Mandate glory

## Megacorps

The world is dominated by classic cyberpunk-esque megacorporations, each one far more important than the vestigial national remnants that encompass them. These megacorps are usually locked in a cold war, trading and dealing with each other even as they try to strike in deniable ways. An over-council of corporations usually acts to bring into line any that get excessively overt in their activities.

### Enemies

Megalomaniacal executive, Underling looking to use the PCs as catspaws, Ruthless mercenary who wants what the PCs have

### Friends

Victim of megacorp scheming, Offworlder merchant in far over their head, Local reformer struggling to cope with megacorp indifference

## Minimal Contact

The locals refuse most contact with offworlders. Only a small, quarantined treaty port is provided for offworld trade, and ships can expect an exhaustive search for contraband. Local governments may be trying to keep the very existence of interstellar trade a secret from their populations, or they may simply consider offworlders too dangerous or repugnant to be allowed among the population.

### Places

Formlessly pitch-black wilderness, Sea without a sun, Location defined by sounds or smells

## Nomads

Most of the natives of this world are nomadic, usually following a traditional cycle of movement through the lands they possess.

Other groups are forced to move constantly due to unpredictable dangers that crop up on the planet.

### Enemies

Desperate tribal leader who needs what the PCs have, Ruthless raider chieftain, Leader seeking to weld the nomads into an army

The world is entirely or almost entirely covered with liquid water. Habitations might be floating cities, or might cling precariously to the few rocky atolls jutting up from the waves, or are planted as bubbles on promontories deep beneath the stormy surface. Survival depends on aquaculture. Planets with inedible alien life rely on gengineered Terran sea crops.

### Enemies

Pirate raider, Violent “salvager” gang, Tentacled sea monster

### Friends

Daredevil fisherman, Sea hermit, Sapient native life

### Complications

The liquid flux confuses grav engines too badly for them to function on this world, Sea is corrosive or toxic, The seas are wracked by regular storms

### Places

The only island on the planet, Floating spaceport, Deck of a storm-swept ship, Undersea bubble city

## Out of Contact

The natives have been entirely out of contact with the greater galaxy for centuries or longer. Perhaps the original colonists were seeking to hide from the rest of the universe, or the Silence destroyed any means of communication. It may have been so long that human origins on other worlds have regressed into a topic for legends. The players might be on the first offworld ship to land since the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago.

### Enemies

Fearful local ruler, Zealous native cleric, Sinister power that has kept the world isolated

## Perimeter Agency

Before the Silence, the Perimeter was a Terran-sponsored organization charged with rooting out use of maltech, technology banned in human space as too dangerous for use or experimentation. Unbraked AIs, gengineered slave species, nanotech replicators, weapons of planetary destruction&hellip; the Perimeter hunted down experimenters with a great indifference to planetary laws. Most Perimeter Agencies collapsed during the Silence, but a few managed to hold on to their mission, though modern Perimeter agents often find more work as conventional spies.

### Enemies

## Pilgrimage Site

The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location, and might be the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or political movement. The site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout nearby space, and those with the money necessary to manage interstellar travel can be quite generous to the site and its keepers. The locals tend to be fiercely protective of the place and its reputation, and some places may forbid the entrance of those not suitably pious or devout.

### Enemies

Saboteur devoted to a rival belief, Bitter reformer who resents the current leadership, Swindler conning the pilgrims

### Friends

Protector of the holy site, Naive offworlder pilgrim, Outsider wanting to learn the sanctum's inner secrets

Matchless local beauty, stunningly gengineered natives, a wide variety of local drugs, carnal pleasures unacceptable on other worlds, or some other rare delight is readily available here. Most worlds are fully aware of the value of their offerings, and the prices they demand can be in credits or in less tangible recompense.

### Enemies

Purveyor of evil delights, Local seeking to control others with addictions, Offworlder exploiter of native resources

### Friends

Tourist who's in too deep, Native seeking a more meaningful life elsewhere, Offworld entertainer looking for training here

### Complications

A deeply repugnant pleasure is offered here by a culture that sees nothing wrong with it, Certain pleasures here are dangerously addictive, The prices here can involve enslavement or death, The world has been seized and exploited by an imperial power

### Things

Forbidden drug, A contract for some unspeakable payment, Powerful tech repurposed for hedonistic ends

### Places

Breathtaking natural feature, Artful but decadent salon, Grimy den of desperate vice

## Post-Scarcity

The locals have maintained sufficient Mandate-era tech to be effectively post-scarcity in their economic structure. Everyone has all the necessities and most of the desires they can imagine. Conflict now exists over the apportionment of services and terrestrial space, since anything else can be had in abundance. Military goods and items of mass destruction may still be restricted, and there is probably some reason that the locals do not export their vast wealth.

### Enemies

Frenzied ideologue fighting over an idea, Paranoid local fearing offworlder influence, Grim reformer seeking the destruction of the “enfeebling” productive tech

### Friends

Offworlder seeking something available only here, Local struggling to maintain the production tech, Native missionary seeking to bring abundance to other worlds

### Complications

The tech causes serious side-effects on those who take advantage of it, The tech is breaking down, The population is growing too large, The tech produces only certain things in abundance

### Things

A cornucopia device, A rare commodity that cannot be duplicated, Contract for services

### Places

Tiny but richly-appointed private quarters, Mar ket for services, Hushed non-duped art salon

## Police State

The world is a totalitarian police state. Any sign of disloyalty to the planet's rulers is punished severely, and suspicion riddles society. Some worlds might operate by Soviet-style informers and indoctrination, while more technically sophisticated worlds might rely on omnipresent cameras or braked AI “guardian angels”. Outworlders are apt to be treated as a necessary evil at best, and “disappeared” if they become troublesome.

### Enemies

Secret police chief, Scapegoating official, Treacherous native informer

### Friends

Rebel leader, Offworld agitator, Imprisoned victim, Crime boss

### Complications

The natives largely believe in the righteousness of the state, The police state is automated and its “rulers” can't shut it off, The leaders foment a pogrom against “offworlder spies”.

### Things

List of police informers, Wealth taken from “enemies of the state”, Dear Leader's private stash

### Places

Military parade, Gulag, Gray concrete housing block, Surveillance center

## Preceptor Archive

The Preceptors of the Great Archive were a pre-Silence organization devoted to ensuring the dissemination of human culture, history, and basic technology to frontier worlds that risked losing this information during the human expansion. Most frontier planets had an Archive where natives could learn useful technical skills in addition to human history and art. Those Archives that managed to survive the Silence now strive to send their missionaries of knowledge to new worlds in need of their lore.

### Enemies

Luddite native, Offworld merchant who wants the natives kept ignorant, Religious zealot, Corrupted First Speaker who wants to keep a monopoly on learning

### Friends

Preceptor Adept missionary, Offworld scholar, Reluctant student, Roving Preceptor Adept

### Complications

The local Archive has taken a very religious and mystical attitude toward their teaching, The Archive has maintained some replicable pretech science, The Archive has been corrupted and their teaching is incorrect

### Things

Lost Archive database, Ancient pretech teaching equipment, Hidden cache of unacceptable tech

### Places

Archive lecture hall, Experimental labora tory, Student-local riot

## Pretech Cultists

The capacities of human science before the Silence vastly outmatch the technology available since the Scream. The Jump Gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of light years in a moment, and they were just one example of the results won by blending psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds outright worship the artifacts of their ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect humanity. These cultists may or may not understand the operation or replication of these devices, but they seek and guard them jealously.

### Enemies

Cult leader, Artifact supplier, Pretech smuggler

### Friends

Offworld scientist, Robbed collector, Cult heretic

### Complications

The cultists can actually replicate certain forms of pretech, The cultists abhor use of the devices as “presumption on the holy”, The cultists mistake the party's belongings for pretech

### Things

Pretech artifacts both functional and broken, Religious-jargon laced pretech replication techniques, Waylaid payment for pretech artifacts

### Places

Shrine to nonfunctional pretech, Smuggler's den, Public procession showing a prized artifact

## Prison Planet

This planet is or was intended as a prison. Some such prisons were meant for specific malefactors of the Terran Mandate, while others were to contain entire “dangerous” ethnic groups or alien races. Some may still have warden AIs or automatic systems to prevent any unauthorized person from leaving, and any authorization permits have long since expired.

### Enemies

Crazed warden AI, Brutal heir to gang leadership, Offworlder who's somehow acquired warden powers and exploits the locals

### Friends

Innocent local born here, Native technician forced to maintain the very tech that imprisons them, Offworlder trapped here by accident

### Complications

Departure permits are a precious currency, The prison industry still makes valuable pretech devices, Gangs have metamorphosed into governments, The local nobility descended from the prison staff

### Things

A pass to get offworld, A key to bypass ancient security devices, Contraband forbidden by the security scanners

### Places

Mandate-era prison block converted to government building, Industrial facility manned by mandatory numbers of prisoners, Make shift shop where contraband is assembled

## Primitive Aliens

The world is populated by a large number of sapient aliens that have yet to develop advanced technology. The human colonists may have a friendly or hostile relationship with the aliens, but a certain intrinsic tension is likely. Small human colonies might have been enslaved or otherwise subjugated.

### Enemies

Hostile alien chief, Human firebrand, Dangerous local predator, Alien religious zealot

### Friends

Colonist leader, Peace-faction alien chief, Planetary frontiersman, Xenoresearcher

### Complications

### Things

Alien religious icon, Ancient alien-human treaty, Alien technology

### Places

Alien village, Fortified human settlement, Massacre site

## Psionics Academy

This world is one of the few that have managed to redevelop the basics of psychic training. Without this education, a potential psychic is doomed to either madness or death unless they refrain from using their abilities. Psionic academies are rare enough that offworlders are often sent there to study by wealthy patrons. The secrets of psychic mentorship, the protocols and techniques that allow a psychic to successfully train another, are carefully guarded at these academies. Most are closely affiliated with the planetary government.

### Enemies

Corrupt psychic instructor, Renegade student, Mad psychic researcher, Resentful townie

### Friends

Offworld researcher, Aspiring student, Wealthy tourist

### Complications

The academy curriculum kills a significant percentage of students, The faculty use students as research subjects, The students are indoctrinated as sleeper agents, The local natives hate the academy, The academy is part of a religion.

### Things

Secretly developed psitech, A runaway psychic mentor, Psychic research prize

### Places

Training grounds, Experimental laboratory, School library, Campus
hangout

## Psionics Fear

The locals are terrified of psychics. Perhaps their history is studded with feral psychics who went on murderous rampages, or perhaps they simply nurse an unreasoning terror of those “mutant freaks”. Psychics demonstrate their powers at risk of their lives.

### Enemies

Mental purity investigator, Suspicious zealot, Witch-finder

### Friends

Hidden psychic, Offworlder trapped here, Offworld educator

### Complications

Psychic potential is much more common here, Some tech is mistaken as psitech, Natives believe certain rituals and customs can protect them from psychic powers

### Things

Hidden psitech cache, Possessions of convicted psychics, Reward for turning in a psychic

### Places

Inquisitorial chamber, Lynching site, Museum of psychic atrocities

## Psionics Worship

These natives view psionic powers as a visible gift of god or sign of superiority. If the world has a functional psychic training academy, psychics occupy almost all major positions of power and are considered the natural and proper rulers of the world. If the world lacks training facilities, it is likely a hodgepodge of demented cults, with each one dedicated to a marginally-coherent feral prophet and their psychopathic ravings.

### Enemies

Psychic inquisitor, Haughty mind-noble, Psychic slaver, Feral prophet

### Friends

Offworlder psychic researcher, Native rebel, Offworld employer seeking psychics

### Complications

The psychic training is imperfect, and the psychics all show significant mental illness, The psychics have developed a unique discipline, The will of a psychic is law, Psychics in the party are forcibly kidnapped for “enlightening”.

### Things

Ancient psitech, Valuable psychic research records, Permission for psychic training

### Places

Psitech-imbued council chamber, Temple to the mind, Sanitarium-prison for feral psychics

## Quarantined World

The world is under a quarantine, and space travel to and from it is strictly forbidden. This may be enforced by massive ground batteries that burn any interlopers from the planet's sky, or it may be that a neighboring world runs a persistent blockade.

### Enemies

Defense installation commander, Suspicious patrol leader, Crazed asteroid hermit

### Friends

Relative of a person trapped on the world, Humanitarian relief official, Treasure hunter

### Complications

The natives want to remain isolated, The quarantine is enforced by an ancient alien installation, The world is rife with maltech abominations, The blockade is meant to starve everyone on the barren world.

### Things

Defense grid key, Bribe for getting someone out, Abandoned alien tech

### Places

Bridge of a blockading ship, Defense installation control room,
Refugee camp

## Radioactive World

Whether due to a legacy of atomic warfare unhindered by nuke snuffers or a simple profusion of radioactive elements, this world glows in the dark. Even heavy vacc suits can filter only so much of the radiation, and most natives suffer a wide variety of cancers, mutations and other illnesses without the protection of advanced medical treatments.

### Enemies

Bitter mutant, Relic warlord, Desperate would-be escapee

### Friends

Reckless prospector, Offworld scavenger, Biogenetic variety seeker

### Complications

Mutant-infested ruins, Scorched glass plain, Wilderness of bizarre native life, Glowing barrens

## Refugees

The world teems with refugees, either exiles from another planet who managed to get here, or the human detritus of some local conflict that have fled to the remaining stable states. The natives usually regard the refugees with hostility, an attitude returned by many among their unwilling guests.

### Enemies

Xenophobic native leader, Refugee chief aspiring to seize the host nation, Politician seeking to use the refugees as a weapon

### Friends

Sympathetic refugee waif, Local hard-pressed by refugee gangs, Clergy seeking peace

### Complications

### Things

Treasures brought out by fleeing refugees, Citizenship papers, Cache of vital refugee supplies, Hidden arms for terrorists

### Places

Hopeless refugee camp, City swarming with confused strangers, Festival full of angry locals

## Restrictive Laws

A myriad of laws, customs, and rules constrain the inhabitants of this world, and even acts that are completely permissible elsewhere are punished severely here. The locals may provide lists of these laws to offworlders, but few non-natives can hope to master all the important intricacies.

### Enemies

Law enforcement officer, Outraged native, Native lawyer specializing in peeling offworlders, Paid snitch

### Friends

Frustrated offworlder, Repressed native, Reforming crusader

### Complications

### Places

Courtroom, Mob scene of outraged locals, Legislative chamber, Police station

## Regional Hegemon

This world has the technological sophistication, natural resources, and determined polity necessary to be a regional hegemon for the sector. Nearby worlds are likely either directly subservient to it or tack carefully to avoid its anger. It may even be the capital of a small stellar empire.

### Enemies

Ambitious general, Colonial official, Contemptuous noble

### Friends

Diplomat, Offworld ambassador, Foreign spy

### Complications

The hegemon's influence is all that's keeping a murderous war from breaking out on nearby worlds, The hegemon is decaying and losing its control, The government is riddled with spies, The hegemon is genuinely benign

### Things

Diplomatic carte blanche, Deed to an offworld estate, Foreign aid grant

### Places

Palace or seat of government, Salon teeming with spies, Protest rally, Military base

## Revanchists

The locals formerly owned another world, or a major nation on the planet formerly owned an additional region of land. Something happened to take away this control or drive out the former rulers, and they've never forgotten it. The locals are obsessed with reclaiming their lost lands, and will allow no questions of practicality to interfere with their cause.

### Enemies

Demagogue whipping the locals on to a hopeless war, Politician seeking to use the resentment for their own ends, Local convinced the PCs are agents of the “thieving” power, Refugee from the land bitterly demanding it be reclaimed

### Friends

Realist local clergy seeking peace, Politician trying to calm the public, Third-party diplomat trying to stamp out the fire

### Complications

The revanchists' claim is completely just and reasonable, The land is now occupied entirely by heirs of the conquerors, Both sides have seized lands the other thinks are theirs

### Things

Stock of vital resource produced by the taken land, Relic carried out of it, Proof that the land claim is justified or unjustified

### Places

Memorial monument to the loss, Cemetery of those who died in the conquest, Public ceremony commemorating the disaster

## Revolutionaries

The world is convulsed by one or more bands of revolutionaries, with some nations perhaps in the grip of a current revolution. Most of these upheavals can be expected only to change the general flavor of problems in the polity, but the process of getting there usually produces a tremendous amount of suffering.

### Enemies

Blood-drenched revolutionary leader, Blood-drenched secret police chief, Hostile foreign agent seeking further turmoil

### Friends

Sympathetic victim accused of revolutionary sympathies or government collaboration, Revolutionary or state agent who now repents, Agent of a neutral power that wants peace

### Things

List of secret revolutionary sympathizers, Proof of rebel hypocrisy, Confiscated wealth

### Places

Festival that explodes into violence, Heavily-fortified police station, Revolutionary base hidden in the wilderness

## Rising Hegemon

This world is not yet a dominant power in the sector, but it's well on its way there. Whether through newly-blossoming economic, military, or cultural power, they're extending their influence over their neighbors and forging new arrangements between their government and the rulers of nearby worlds.

### Enemies

Jingoistic supremacist, Official bent on glorious success, Foreign agent saboteur

### Friends

Friendly emissary to the benighted, Hardscrabble local turned great success, Foreign visitor seeking contacts or knowledge

### Things

Tribute shipment, Factory or barracks emblematic of their power source, Tech or data that will deal a blow to their rise

### Places

Rustic town being hurled into prosperity, Government building being expanded, Starport struggling under the flow of new ships

## Rigid Culture

The local culture is extremely rigid. Certain forms of behavior and belief are absolutely mandated, and any deviation from these principles is punished, or else society may be strongly stratified by birth with limited prospects for change. Anything which threatens the existing social order is feared and shunned.

### Enemies

Rigid reactionary, Wary ruler, Regime ideologue, Offended potentate

### Friends

Revolutionary agitator, Ambitious peasant, Frustrated merchant

### Places

Time-worn palace, Low-caste slums, Bandit den, Reformist temple

## Ritual Combat

The locals favor some form of stylized combat to resolve disputes, provide entertainment, or settle religious differences. This combat is probably not normally lethal unless it's reserved for a specific disposable class of slaves or professionals. Some combat may involve mastery of esoteric weapons and complex arenas, while other forms might require nothing more than a declaration in the street and a drawn gun.

### Enemies

Bloodthirsty local champion, Ambitious gladiator stable owner, Xenophobic master fighter

### Friends

Peace-minded foreign missionary, Temperate defender of the weak, Local eager to learn of offworld fighting styles

### Complications

### Things

Magnificent weapon, Secret book of martial techniques, Token signifying immunity to ritual combat challenges, Prize won in bloody battle

### Places

Area full of cheering spectators, Dusty street outside a saloon, Memorial for fallen warriors

## Robots

The world has a great many robots on it. Most bots are going to be non-sentient expert systems, though an AI with enough computing resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have developed VIs to a degree that individual bots can seem (or be) sentient. Some worlds might even be ruled by metal overlords, ones which do not need to be sentient so long as they have overwhelming force.

### Enemies

Hostile robot master, Robot greedy to seize offworld tech, Robot fallen in love with the PC's ship, Oligarch whose factories build robots

### Friends

Data-seeking robot, Plucky young robot tech, Local being pushed out of a job by robots

Prototype robot, Secret robot override codes, Vast cache of robot-made goods, Robot-destroying pretech weapon

### Places

Humming robotic factory, Stark robotic “barracks”, House crowded with robot servants and only one human owner

## Seagoing Cities

Either the world is entirely water or else the land is simply too dangerous for most humans. Human settlement on this world consists of a number of floating cities that follow the currents and the fish. These cityships might have been purpose-built for their task, or they could be jury-rigged conglomerations of ships and structures thrown together when the need for seagoing life become apparent to the locals.

### Enemies

Pirate city lord, Mer-human raider chieftain, Hostile landsman noble, Enemy city saboteur

### Friends

City navigator, Scout captain, Curious mer-human, Hard-pressed ship-city engineer

### Places

Bridge of the city, Storm-tossed sea, A bridge fashioned of many small boats.

## Sealed Menace

Something on this planet has the potential to create enormous havoc for the inhabitants if it is not kept safely contained by its keepers. Whether a massive seismic fault line suppressed by pretech terraforming technology, a disease that has to be quarantined within hours of discovery, or an ancient alien relic that requires regular upkeep in order to prevent planetary catastrophe, the menace is a constant shadow on the fearful populace.

### Enemies

Hostile outsider bent on freeing the menace, Misguided fool who thinks he can use it, Reckless researcher who thinks he can fix it

### Places

Guarded fortress containing the menace, Monitoring station, Scene of a prior outbreak of the menace

## Secret Masters

The world is actually run by a hidden cabal, acting through their catspaws in the visible government. For one reason or another, this group finds it imperative that they not be identified by outsiders, and in some cases even the planet's own government may not realize that they're actually being manipulated by hidden masters.

### Enemies

An agent of the cabal, Government official who wants no questions asked, Willfully blinded local

### Friends

Paranoid conspiracy theorist, Machiavellian gamesman within the cabal, Interstellar investigator

### Places

Smoke-filled room, Shadowy alleyway, Secret underground bunker

## Sectarians

The world is torn by violent disagreement between sectarians of a particular faith. Each views the other as a damnable heresy in need of extirpation. Local government may be able to keep open war from breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities. The nature of the faith may be religious, or it may be based on some secular ideology.

### Enemies

Paranoid believer, Native convinced the party is working for the other side, Absolutist ruler

### Friends

Reformist clergy, Local peacekeeping official, Offworld missionary, Exhausted ruler

### Things

Ancient holy book, Incontrovertible proof, Offering to a local holy man

### Places

Sectarian battlefield, Crusading temple, Philosopher's salon, Bitterly divided village

## Seismic Instability

The local land masses are remarkably unstable, and regular earthquakes rack the surface. Local construction is either advanced enough to sway and move with the vibrations or primitive enough that it is easily rebuilt. Severe volcanic activity may be part of the instability.

### Enemies

Earthquake cultist, Hermit seismologist, Burrowing native life form, Earthquake-inducing saboteur

### Friends

Experimental construction firm owner, Adventurous volcanologist, Geothermal prospector

### Complications

### Things

Earthquake generator, Earthquake suppressor, Mineral formed at the core of the world, Earthquake-proof building schematics

### Places

Volcanic caldera, Village during an earthquake, Mud slide, Earthquake opening superheated steam fissures

## Shackled World

This world is being systematically contained by an outside power. Some ancient autonomous defense grid, robot law enforcement, alien artifact, or other force is preventing the locals from developing certain technology, or using certain devices, or perhaps from developing interstellar flight. This limit may or may not apply to off-worlders; in the former case, the PCs may have to figure out a way to beat the shackles simply to escape the world.

### Enemies

Passionless jailer-AI, Paranoid military grid AI, Robot overlord, Enigmatic alien master

### Friends

Struggling local researcher, Offworlder trapped here, Scientist with a plan to break the chains

### Places

Grim high-tech control center, Factory full of workaround tech, Temple to the power or entity that imposed the shackle

## Sole Supplier

Some extremely important resource is exported from this world and this world alone. It's unlikely that the substance is critical for building spike drives unless this world is also the first to begin interstellar flight, but it may be critical to other high-tech processes or devices. The locals make a large amount of money off this trade and control of it is of critical importance to the planet's rulers, and potentially to outside powers.

### Enemies

Resource oligarch, Ruthless smuggler, Resource-controlling warlord, Foreign agent seeking to subvert local government

### Friends

Doughty resource miner, Researcher trying to synthesize the stuff, Small-scale resource producer, Harried starport trade overseer

### Complications

### Things

Cache of processed resource, Trade permit to buy a load of it, A shipment of nigh-un-detectably fake substance

### Places

Bustling resource extraction site, Opulent palace built with resource money, Lazy town square where everyone lives on resource payments

## Societal Despair

The world's dominant society has lost faith in itself. Whether through some all-consuming war, great catastrophe, overwhelming outside culture, or religious collapse, the natives no longer believe in their old values, and search desperately for something new. Fierce conflict often exists between the last believers in the old dispensation and the nihilistic or searching disciples of the new age.

### Enemies

Zealot who blames outsiders for the decay, Nihilistic warlord, Offworlder looking to exploit the local despair

### Friends

Struggling messenger of a new way, Valiant paragon of a fading tradition, Local going through the motions of serving a now-irrelevant role

### Complications

### Things

Relic that would inspire a renaissance, Art that would inspire new ideas, Priceless artifact of a now-scorned belief

### Places

Empty temple, Crowded den of obliviating vice, Smoky hall full of frantic speakers

## Taboo Treasure

The natives here produce something that is both fabulously valuable and strictly forbidden elsewhere in the sector. It may be a lethally addictive drug, forbidden gengineering tech, vatgrown “perfect slaves”, or a useful substance that can only be made through excruciating human suffering. This treasure is freely traded on the world, but bringing it elsewhere is usually an invitation to a long prison stay or worse.

### Enemies

Maker of a vile commodity, Smuggler for a powerful offworlder, Depraved offworlder here for “fun”, Local warlord who controls the treasure

### Friends

Reformer seeking to end its use, Innovator trying to repurpose the treasure in innocent ways, Wretched addict unwillingly prey to the treasure

### Complications

The treasure is extremely hard to smuggle, Its use visibly marks a user, The natives consider it for their personal use only,

### Things

Load of the forbidden good, Smuggling tech that could hide the good perfectly, Blackmail data on offworld buyers of the good

### Places

Den where the good is used, Market selling the good to locals and a few outsiders, Factory or processing area where the good is created

## Terraform Failure

This world was marginal for human habitation when it was discovered, but the Mandate or the early government put in pretech terraforming engines to correct its more extreme qualities. The terraforming did not entirely work, either failing of its own or suffering the destruction of the engines during the Silence. The natives are only partly adapted to the world's current state, and struggle with the environment.

### Enemies

Brutal ruler who cares only for their people, Offworlder trying to
loot the damaged engines, Warlord trying to seize limited habitable
land

### Friends

Local trying to fix the engines, Offworlder student of the engines, World-wise native survivor

### Complications

The engines produced too much of something instead of too little, The engines were hijacked by aliens with different preferences, It was discovered that an Earth-like environment would eventually cause a catastrophic disaster

### Things

Parts to repair or restore the engines, Lootable pretech fragments, Valuable local tech devised to cope with the world

### Places

Zone of tolerable gravity or temperature, Native settlement built to cope with the environment, Massive ruined terraforming engine

## Tomb World

Tomb worlds are planets that were once inhabited by humans before the Silence. The sudden collapse of the jump gate network and the inability to bring in the massive food supplies required by the planet resulted in starvation, warfare, and death. Most tomb worlds are naturally hostile to human habitation and could not raise sufficient crops to maintain life. The few hydroponic facilities were usually destroyed in the fighting, and all that is left now are ruins, bones, and silence.

### Enemies

Demented survivor tribe chieftain, Avaricious scavenger, Automated defense system, Native predator

### Friends

Scavenger Fleet captain, Archaeologist, Salvaging historian, Xenophilic native survivor

### Complications

The ruins are full of booby-traps left by the final inhabitants, The world's atmosphere quickly degrades anything in an opened building, A handful of desperate natives survived the Silence, The structures are unstable and collapsing

### Places

Crumbling hive-city, City square carpeted in bones, Ruined hydroponic facility, Cannibal tribe's lair, Dead orbital jump gate

## Theocracy

The planet is ruled by the priesthood of the predominant religion or ideology. The rest of the locals may or may not be terribly pious, but the clergy have the necessary military strength, popular support or control of resources to maintain their rule. Alternative faiths or incompatible ideologies are likely to be both illegal and socially unacceptable.

### Enemies

Decadent priest-ruler, Zealous inquisitor, Relentless proselytizer, True Believer

### Friends

Heretic, Offworld theologian, Atheistic merchant, Desperate commoner

### Complications

The theocracy actually works well, The theocracy is decadent and hated by the common folk, The theocracy is divided into mutually hostile sects, The theocracy is led by aliens

### Things

### Places

Glorious temple, Austere monastery, Academy for ideological indoctrination, Decadent pleasure-cathedral

## Trade Hub

This world is a major crossroads for local interstellar trade. It is well-positioned at the nexus of several short-drill trade routes, and has facilities for easy transfer of valuable cargoes and the fueling and repairing of starships. The natives are accustomed to outsiders, and a polyglot mass of people from every nearby world can be found trading here.

### Enemies

Cheating merchant, Thieving dockworker, Commercial spy, Corrupt customs official

### Friends

Rich tourist, Hardscrabble free trader, Merchant prince in need of catspaws, Friendly spaceport urchin

### Places

Raucous bazaar, Elegant restaurant, Spaceport teeming with activity, Foggy street lined with warehouses

## Tyranny

The local government is brutal and indifferent to the will of the people. Laws may or may not exist, but the only one that matters is the whim of the rulers on any given day. Their minions swagger through the streets while the common folk live in terror of their appetites. The only people who stay wealthy are friends and servants of the ruling class.

### Enemies

Debauched autocrat, Sneering bully-boy, Soulless government official, Occupying army officer

### Friends

Conspiring rebel, Oppressed merchant, Desperate peasant, Inspiring religious leader

### Places

Impoverished village, Protest rally massacre, Decadent palace, Religious hospital for the indigent

## Urbanized Surface

The world's land area is covered with buildings that extend downward for multiple levels. Such worlds either have a population in the trillions, extremely little land area, or are largely-abandoned due to some past catastrophe. Agriculture and resource extraction are part of the urban complex, and there may be an advanced maintenance system that may not be entirely under the control of present natives.

### Enemies

Maintenance AI that hates outsiders, Tyrant of a habitation block, Deep-dwelling prophet who considers “the sky” a blasphemy to be quelled

### Friends

## Unbraked AI

Artificial intelligences are costly and difficult to create, requiring a careful sequence of “growth stages” in order to bring them to sentience before artificial limits on cognition speed and learning development are installed. These “brakes” prevent runaway cognition metastasis. This world has an “unbraked AI” on it, probably with a witting or unwitting corps of servants. Unbraked AIs are quite insane, but they learn and reason with a speed impossible for humans, and can demonstrate a truly distressing subtlety.

## Utopia

Natural and social conditions on this world have made it a paradise for its inhabitants, a genuine utopia of happiness and fulfillment. This is normally the result of drastic human engineering, including brain-gelding, neurochemical control, personality curbs, or complete “humanity” redefinitions. Even so, the natives are extremely happy with their lot, and may wish to extend that joy to poor, sad outsiders.

## Warlords

The world is plagued by warlords. Numerous powerful men and women control private armies sufficiently strong to cow whatever local government may exist. On the lands they claim, their word is law. Most spend their time oppressing their own subjects and murderously pillaging those of their neighbors. Most like to wrap themselves in the mantle of ideology, religious fervor, or an ostensibly legitimate right to rule.

The natives are intensely averse to dealings with outworlders. Whether through cultural revulsion, fear of tech contamination, or a genuine immunodeficiency, the locals shun foreigners from offworld and refuse to have anything to do with them beyond the bare necessities of contact. Trade may or may not exist on this world, but if it does, it is almost certainly conducted by a caste of untouchables and outcasts.

# Atmosphere

The first step in randomized world generation is determining the planet's atmosphere. In some cases, this is going to be preordained; if you want a barren asteroid base, it's not going to have any atmosphere at all. If you want a world teeming with human life, on the other hand, it almost certainly is going to have a breathable atmosphere.

Note that if a truly noxious atmosphere, climate, or biosphere turns up on a random roll, you should think carefully about what has made humans choose to live on such a world. Perhaps the original colonists were prisoners exiled to an open-world prison. It could be their ancestors sought isolation at all costs. Given its position in the sector, it might be a vital refueling and trading port for multiple short-run spike drive courses. The original colonists might have had to make an emergency landing. Whatever the reason, it takes a powerful motivation to make a band of colonists decide to make a corrosive, burning hellhole of a planet their permanent home.

## Types of Atmospheres

***Corrosive atmospheres*** are dangerously hostile to conventional vacc suits and other protective gear. They steadily strip away at a suit's vent ports, wiring connections, and other weak spots until they eventually break through and flood the suit with a toxic cocktail that usually kills a victim in seconds. Weak atmospheres might require as much as a day to degrade a vacc suit, while strong ones might accomplish the job in an hour. Even forcefield-based environment suits such as a FEP suffer steady damage to their exposed elements. ^atmospheres-corrosive

Native vacc suits are usually covered with an ablative layer or spray that can be regularly renewed, and their buildings often rely on a steadily-extruded slurry of neutralizing materials that can be constantly renewed by pores in the building surface itself. This often gives the building a drippy, half-melted look that may be more than cosmetic in the case of those structures that have failing slurry pumps. Advanced tech level 5 equipment may be able to overcome the effects, but even pretech is often taxed by the relentless rigors of this world. Vehicles and shuttles are kept in pressurized garages when not in use, and starships never land for long.

Corrosive worlds have a number of intrinsic adventure complications, the largest being the way that every activity outside of a hab building comes with a built-in time limit. Whatever the party chooses to do outside of a building, it has to accomplish before their suit seals fail or the atmosphere corrodes a hole in their vehicle hull. A clever GM can use this problem to add extra tension to an otherwise simple task.

### Table - Atmospheres

| 2d6 | Atmosphere Type                             |
|:---:| ------------------------------------------- |
|  2  | Corrosive, damaging to foreign objects      |
|  3  | Inert gas, useless for respiration          |
|  4  | Airless or thin to the point of suffocation |
| 5-9 | Breathable mix                              |
| 10  | Thick, but breathable with a pressure mask  |
| 11  | Invasive, penetrating suit seals            |
| 12  | Both corrosive and invasive in its effects  |



***Inert gas*** atmospheres aren't hostile or poisonous, but they're unbreathable by humans. If the planet's climate is otherwise tolerable, the natives might be able to live and work outdoors without anything more than an air tank and face mask. Some degree of technical sophistication is going to be necessary for humanity to survive, and large supplies of oxygen are going to have to be extracted from some local source. “Air mines” might exist to replace the oxygen lost during human use, or local power plants might need to be kept running full blast in order to crack water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. ^atmosphere-inert-gas

On worlds with an unbreathable atmosphere, control of the air supply makes it much harder for locals to rebel against their leaders. Without the equipment and power to generate their own air supplies, would-be rebels are entirely at the mercy of those who control the oxygen. Most rulers pick up on this fact rapidly, and some worlds with unbreathable atmospheres might even make it a crime to own illicit oxygen generation equipment.

***Airless or thin atmospheres*** are appropriate to asteroids, rocky planetoids, or barren worlds that have had their atmospheres burnt off by weapons or cosmic caprice. Whatever atmosphere exists is too thin to support human life, if it exists at all, and the world is largely naked to the chill of space and the blaze of stellar heat. Exposure to the planet's surface without a vacc suit or pressurized building is as lethal as exposure to hard vacuum. ^atmosphere-airless-thin

Airless worlds are hostile to human life, but they excel at preserving the relics of the past. Provided that the ruins or remains are kept out of the baking heat of the local stellar body and the impact of random meteorites, they can survive for millions of years. Some exceptionally ancient alien ruins might even date back from before the world lost its atmosphere.

***Breathable mix*** atmospheres can support human life without additional equipment or engineered modification. Any world that has a human population in the millions or more almost certainly has a breathable mix atmosphere. ^atmosphere-breathable-mix

While the air is breathable, almost every world has its own subtle cocktail of inert gases, atmospheric contaminants, and other odoriferous ingredients. For spacers accustomed to the filtered air supply of a starship, the “new world stink” of a fresh planetfall can be maddening, as few linger long enough to get used to the smell of the local air. Attempting to explain the source of this discomfort to the locals rarely results in positive results. Some spaceport bars make a point of their air filtration and composition mixers.

***Thick atmospheres*** can usually be breathed with the aid of a filter mask, though the mix of contaminants renders it slowly or quickly toxic to humans who attempt to breathe it straight. Separate air supplies are not necessary to supplement the blend, but any society that means to survive on such a world must have sufficient technological expertise to manufacture and maintain large numbers of filter masks. ^atmosphere-thick

Thick atmospheres are often at least semi-opaque, and some worlds have thick atmospheres that are completely impenetrable to ordinary light. Deep banks of permanent fog might shroud the planet, or natives might have to go about with sophisticated ultraviolet or infrared viewing equipment if they don't wish to be blind. Some banks of gases might be impenetrable to even these viewing tools, leaving a party vulnerable to moments of complete blindness while out on the surface of the world.

***Invasive*** toxic atmospheres are composed of a substantial proportion of molecules small enough to infiltrate past the seals of most vacc suits. This infiltration doesn't harm the suit, but the molecules have to be steadily flushed by the system's purification sensors before they build up to a debilitating level. This causes a much faster bleed of air as breathable oxygen is jettisoned along with the infiltrating molecules. Most invasive atmospheres cut oxygen supply durations by half, at best. ^atmosphere-invasive

Invasive atmospheres make oxygen an even more important resource than it is on inert gas worlds. Outdoor work is avoided whenever possible, as any failure of a suit's toxin sensors or flush system can lead to death before the wearer even realizes something is wrong. Steady exposure to low levels of the toxins can also result in unfortunate effects even with a fully-functional suit. Hallucinations, chronic sickness, or worse can follow.

***Corrosive and invasive*** atmospheres exist at the very border of what human society can tolerate. Combining all the worst traits of an eroding, corrosive atmosphere and the invasive intrusion of toxic molecules, a planet cursed with an atmosphere like this is far more hostile than any mere airless rock. ^atmosphere-corrosive-invasive

Advanced pretech filtering and oxygen generation equipment might be able to maintain tolerable pressurized habitats and hydroponic systems uncontaminated by exterior atmosphere. Anything less than this tech level means greater and greater amounts of societal resources devoted simply to the effort of breathing. Entire civilizations can be oriented around overcoming the difficulties of maintaining their structures and their pressurized homes.

Whatever provoked the initial inhabitants to settle on this world must have been of overwhelming value or necessity to convince them to consign themselves and their children to such a place. It is highly unlikely that enough ship traffic exists to get any but the most fortunate locals offworld, so the rest are obliged to deal with their harsh existence as best they can.

## Temperature

A world's average temperature depends in large part upon its atmosphere. Worlds with an airless or thin atmosphere are directly exposed to the wild temperature variations produced by stellar radiation and the cold void of space, and might flip regularly between unendurable heat and near-absolute zero depending on planetary rotation and orbit.

If a GM intends this planet to have a large human population they should restrict the possibility of a frozen or burning world. Anything that is intolerable to a human without a vacc suit means that major agriculture is unlikely. As it is effectively impossible to feed entire planets through limited interstellar trade, every planet needs to support its own population. A world that can't grow food outside of hydroponic labs or underground farms is unlikely to support millions of people.

## Types of Climates

***Frozen*** worlds are those with so weak a stellar primary or so great a distance that the average temperature is close to absolute zero. Any atmosphere that once existed has long since frozen into drifts of solidified oxygen or lakes of liquid helium. Exposure to these drifts is very dangerous. Vacc suits maintain a tolerable temperature easily because the stellar void is very empty, and there is little conduction of heat between the suit and empty space. Dunking a suit into a lake of thermally-conductive superchilled liquid can force the heating elements into sudden and drastic overload, draining a power cell in minutes or even seconds. ^climate-frozen

***Cold*** worlds are uncomfortable, but a human can survive on them in nothing more than heavy clothing. ^climate-cold

The worst of the cold worlds are similar in condition to Earth's Antarctic regions, barren wastes of ice and wind. The more clement ones have brief warmer seasons or equatorial bands that get enough solar radiation to support substantial agriculture.

On cold worlds, agricultural land is at a premium. The population is unlikely to be willing to limit its numbers to what hydroponic farms can provide, and they may lack the technology for wide-scale artificial production methods. Savage wars may have broken out over control of fertile growing regions, and populations have perhaps been driven away from the arable land into the cold zones and a lingering death.

Some worlds retain installations from before the Silence deep within the frozen wastes, ancient bases and laboratories that were planted in an age when good launch sites and orbital windows meant more than trifles of temperature. These lost sites might be remembered in legend and story, and some native leaders might still be in possession of the automatic defense bypass codes handed down by their ancestors.

***Temperate*** worlds were the most popular colony sites, and most of the truly populous worlds of the frontier have a temperate climate. Many temperate worlds have temperature ranges not unlike that of Earth, though most are canted a little further toward cold or heat depending on their angle and proximity to the local star. ^climate-temperate

### Table - Temperature Types

| 2d6  | Temperature Type                        |
|:----:| --------------------------------------- |
|  2   | Frozen, locked in perpetual ice         |
|  3   | Cold, dominated by glaciers and tundra  |
| 4-5  | Variable cold with temperate places     |
| 6-8  | Temperate, Earthlike in its ranges      |
| 9-10 | Variable warm, with temperate places    |
|  11  | Warm, tropical and hotter in places     |
|  12  | Burning, intolerably hot on its surface |


Temperate worlds are the most likely to teem with native life as well, and to have alien ruins or remains located somewhere on their surface. Most frontier worlds never accumulated enough population to put a serious strain on a temperate world's arable land, but this same capaciousness often allows for more complicated social divisions to develop. Natives of other worlds are often forced to cooperate or die, while those of a clement temperate world have the luxury of deep and lasting divisions.

***Warm*** worlds come in two main flavors, depending on the prevalence of water. “Desert worlds” are hot enough or arid enough to be deprived of most surface water. Any life on such a planet has to be capable of extracting water from living prey, air currents or moisture supplies deep underground. ^climate-warm

Humans can survive on warm worlds without more than appropriate clothing, but desert-world humans must learn sophisticated techniques of water prospecting and well-drilling in order to maintain their agricultural systems. Warfare often revolves around these water systems.

The other common variety of warm world is one blessed with an abundance of surface water. These worlds tend to be covered with plant and animal life, teeming with thick jungles and vast mats of sargasso on seas that boil with piscids and other alien life analogs. These worlds can be quite prosperous for humans if the native life is edible, but inhabitants are often forced to deal with large predators and a vigorously ingenious native ecology of disease.

***Variable temperature*** worlds tend to show a greater distribution of climates than other worlds, either ranging from cold to temperate levels or temperate to hot levels. This may be a climate that changes world-wide when a long, slow orbit brings the planet into proximity with a stellar primary, or it might be a world that has substantially different climatic zones spread across its surface. The north pole of one world might be a sun-blasted desert that moderates to a cool, wet equator, or an icy world might be warmed here and there by complex channels of geothermally-heated subsurface rivers. Variable temperature worlds tend to have savage weather. The mixing of hot and cold air can send ferocious cyclones and raging hurricanes across the surface of the world, some large enough to consume most of a hemisphere. ^climate-variable

***Burning*** worlds are too hot for a human to survive without equipment similar to a vacc suit in effectiveness. Rivulets of molten lead or copper might bleed from open veins on the hillsides, and many of the same perils that face an explorer on a frozen world have hotter equivalents on a burning one. Ash drifts, pools of molten metal, and superheated liquid vents can bring quick death to an unwary explorer, and the miners who inhabit such worlds must be forever vigilant against the perils of their burning home. ^climate-burning

## Climate and Adventure

Any planet with Burning or Frozen conditions is going to need some kind of sealed habitat for humanity. Worlds of Cold or Warm temperatures are at least habitable outside of their most extreme zones, though icy planets might not have much arable land on the outside.

As a consequence, planets with Frozen or Burning temperatures tend to have the climate as a backdrop rather than something the PCs regularly need to deal with. If they've landed on such a world's spaceport, it's probably sealed in some subterranean hangar-cavern or domed over by massive civil engineering. The ice or flame might be a constant concern of the locals, but the PCs aren't going to have to cope with it unless they have to leave the inhabited regions of the planet.

On Burning worlds, this isn't going to happen very often. Any habitat without active climate control is going to be melted or torched by local conditions in short order. There will be no ruins to explore or remnants to recover unless they're somehow fireproof.

The easiest use of a Burning world's temperature is as a threat to the locals or the PCs. If something isn't fixed, or if something is destroyed, or if some place isn't evacuated in time, then things will get intolerably hot. There's usually a grace period of increasing temperature to help add urgency to the situation and layer on potential penalties or dangers as the PCs struggle to cope with the situation.

Frozen worlds can be equally lethal if a flood of liquid oxygen threatens to sweep through a habitat or a cold-brittled vital component breaks down. More significantly to PCs, however, frozen worlds tend to be much better about preserving ruins and remains. The PCs might be forced to deal with the frigid temperatures as they search through an alien structure or the icy halls of a dead habitat. Such conditions can lead to strict time limits on an expedition before materials start to brittle and fail under the relentless chill.

## Biosphere

Some worlds are highly unlikely to have a biosphere. An airless rock, a frozen wasteland, or a world of boiling tin all are unlikely to host any sort of life more sophisticated than microbes, though the universe has demonstrated the existence of a few exotic creatures even on seemingly unendurable planets.

The real question of a biosphere is whether or not it's edible. Colonists on a world without edible local life are forced to seed and grow Terran crops, which may well be outcompeted by native life specifically evolved for this world. Such colonists might well end up starving amid gardens of alien fruit, unable to digest any of it. The only benefit of such worlds is the likelihood that humans are just as poisonous to local life, though many large predators don't realize that until after they devour some luckless colonist.

## Types of Biosphere

***Biosphere remnants*** are the wreckage of a ruined ecology. Petrified trees, drifts of preserved bones, forests of dead plant life; something killed all the life on this planet in the relatively recent past. It may have been the exercise of a maltech planet-buster weapon, or a mutant microbe introduced by human colonists, or some volcanic eruption or asteroid impact that plunged the world into decades of frozen night. ^biosphere-remnants

Any local civilization not sophisticated enough to escape the planet likely died when it did. Their ruins and remains might be found throughout the desolate wastes, along with more clues as to the cause of the devastation.

***Microbial*** life is often the only thing that exists on the more inhospitable planets, yet the wide variety of environments that can accommodate life means that these little beasts show up in some of the most unlikely places. Some varieties of slime mold have even managed to evolve on corrosive-atmosphere planets, forming a mucous-like outer shell against the atmosphere and then feeding and growing off the chemical byproducts of its erosion. ^biosphere-microbial


### Table - Biosphere Types

| 2d6  | Biosphere Type             |
|:----:| -------------------------- |
|  2   | Remnant biosphere          |
|  3   | Microbial life forms exist |
| 4-5  | No native biosphere        |
| 6-8  | Human-miscible biosphere   |
| 9-10 | Immiscible biosphere       |
|  11  | Hybrid biosphere           |
|  12  | Engineered biosphere       |



Microbial life can also be dangerous. While most alien microbes are unable to infect or harm the radically different biology of humans, some show enough ingenuity to accomplish even that difficult feat. Rumors of terrible “space plagues” that leave behind only drifting ships and garbled warnings remain a steady staple at spacer bars throughout the known universe.

***No native biosphere*** is occasionally found on even the most temperate and otherwise habitable worlds. For one reason or another, life simply never evolved on these worlds, leaving them a blank slate for the agricultural and ecological efforts of humans. If the world is otherwise amenable to Terran life, such planets can be enormously fertile and agriculturally rich. ^biosphere-no-native

They can also be disasters waiting to happen. Pretech xenobiologists compiled standardized colonization packages of plants, animals, and insect life designed to expand smoothly and evenly to fill the niches of an uninhabited world. Not all colonists implemented these packages correctly, and some worlds had disasters or special circumstances that destabilized their efforts. Some empty worlds are now in a state of constant biological flux as the local ecology strives vainly to find some sort of equilibrium between the myriad imported species and their violent struggle.

More subtly, these worlds can be suddenly and drastically destabilized by the import of some offworld plant or animal. With no strong native ecology to fight off interlopers, the wrong beast or bug can lay waste to whole continents. These planets tend to be extremely paranoid about importation of foreign life forms.

***Human-miscible biospheres*** are those in which some substantial portion of the native life is biologically compatible with human nutritional needs. The local plants and animals may not be tasty or terribly nourishing, but they can support life without the serious importation of Terran crop seeds and livestock. ^biosphere-human-miscible

Even the friendlier human-miscible biospheres often lack the wide variety of edibles that evolved on Earth, and the natives often supplement their stocks of local foods with limited Terran agriculture. Exotic foods, spices, and liquors can be worth interstellar importation to feed the hunger for novelty possessed by the elites on these worlds.

Unfortunately, the fact that humans can eat some native life means that it is very likely that some native life can eat humans as well. Large predators and diseases capable of human infection are by no means uncommon on these worlds, and small colonies can be hard-pressed to survive them.

***Immiscible biospheres*** are not friendly to humans. None of the local plants or animals are edible, and anything the colony needs to eat will have to be grown from Terran stock. Worse, it is common for the pollen and other microbial life of these worlds to be highly allergenic to humans, requiring the regular use of tailored antiallergenics to prevent eventual respiratory failure or exotic immune-system reactions. ^biosphere-immiscible

These worlds are exceptionally susceptible to the temptation of human gengineering. Despite the persistent drawbacks, genetic flaws, and handicaps that human gengineering usually introduces in a subject, the desperate need to eat can drive worlds to wholesale experimentation on their progeny. The resultant altered humans are often able to digest the local food, but commonly pay for it in shortened life spans, physical disabilities, or an inability to consume Terran foodstuffs. Sometimes the consequences are worse still.

Immiscible biospheres produce some of the most exotic plants and animals in human space. Unfettered by the limits of familiar evolutionary patterns, creatures of bizarre beauty and strange configurations are found on many of these worlds. Many lack the intelligence to realize that humans are as poisonous to them as they are to humans.

***Hybrid biospheres*** are a stable intermixing of Terran flora and fauna with local life forms. Most such worlds have been colonized for centuries before the Silence, giving the local ecology time to shake out into a relatively stable configuration of Earth-born organisms and native life. The native biology may or may not be miscible with human life, but it is unlikely to be particularly hostile in any case, or else the interloping life forms would not have been able to get a foothold on the planet. ^biosphere-hybrid

Hybrid biospheres often show strange examples of symbiosis and adaptation, with plants and animals forming new alliances. Large predators from one world may find themselves subsisting on herds of herbivorous alien life, while Terran vegetation provides sustenance for large populations of small, furred, insect-like grazers. Familiar animals may show seemingly bizarre behavior patterns that have formed in response to local conditions, perhaps becoming larger or more aggressive, or having been gengineered for compatibility.

***Engineered biospheres*** are among the rarest, as they require enormous time and effort on the part of a highly advanced civilization. Whatever life exists on this planet has been extensively altered by an alien race or by advanced pretech gengineering methods. Some such worlds are paradise planets, carefully sculpted by some fabulously wealthy predecessor to suit their own tastes. Others are living forges, where foodstuffs and refined minerals are produced as byproducts from the basic organic processes of the world's biosphere. ^biosphere-engineered

Such worlds tend to be fragile. Many engineered worlds are dependent upon regular stabilizing work to prevent genetic drift and adaptations that do not serve the creator's purpose. Without regular pruning and adjustment, engineered biospheres can go badly awry. Some end up leaving nothing but genetic wreckage in their wake, while others go wrong in more subtle ways. Where once the biosphere existed to serve the inhabitants, a creaking engineered biosphere can leave the planet's population chained to constant repair and maintenance efforts just to prevent a planetary collapse.

## Population

Planetary populations hinge on a world's habitability. Worlds incapable of growing food on the planet's surface are unlikely to have more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants at best, and truly inimical worlds might be lucky to have a tenth as many. As a rule of thumb, a world ought to have some kind of human habitation on it unless the GM has a specific purpose for it in mind. A world untouched by human presence can be interesting in many ways, but without elaboration there's little to distinguish it from the next airless ball of rock.

Humans breed quickly, and will tend to push up against the limits of a world's capacity to feed and support them. Some cultures with sufficient tech might rely on contraceptives and birth licensing to ensure sufficient food for its population, while others might choose or be forced to leave matters to simple Malthusian culling. Wars and diseases may also serve as a check on population, or in some cases, cultures may find themselves so wealthy, self-absorbed and comfortable as to voluntarily choose not to reproduce.

## Population Sizes

***Failed colonies*** are occasionally found dotting the worlds of human space. Some date back to the First Wave of human colonization more than a thousand years ago, while others are more recent efforts that guttered out under the strains of a colony's birth. ^population-size-failed-colony

Pirate attacks might have wiped out a young colony, as might a hostile biosphere, alien attack, internal dissension, disease outbreaks, failure of vital colonial equipment, or any one of a hundred other disasters. The ruins of the colony might still have valuable pretech artifacts, however, or colonization deeds authorized by neighboring worlds. A few survivors might even have clung to life in the intervening centuries, maintaining some sort of society in the wreckage of their ancestors' work.

***Outposts*** are rarely composed of more than a few hundred or few thousand colonists at the most. Outposts are either very new colonies that have not have the requisite time to grow or they are uncolonized worlds that just happen to have a naval or corporate base on the surface. ^population-size-outpost

Corporate or military outposts aren't intended to be completely self-sufficient. While large outposts are often forced to raise their own food supplies, replacement personnel, spare parts, and advanced tech must all be brought in from elsewhere. Such temporary outposts are known to find themselves in sudden distress when a vital supply ship fails to make its drop or when some local threat proves more than the staff can handle.

Colonial outposts tend to be better equipped but with less outside backing. Such natives expect to live and die on the world, and are more inclined to build permanent structures and local improvements. Many are exiles, malcontents, or others incapable of tolerating the world that sent them forth, and it can make for a somewhat explosive mix in a young colony. These pioneers tend to be very friendly towards visiting starships, as they are often dependent upon free traders and tramp merchants to bring them vital supplies or news of the sector.

Some “outposts” are really just the stubborn, persistent survivors of a long-failed colonization attempt. These cultures can survive for centuries, perpetually culled by the dangers of the world until the survivors are little more than one more ragged element of the local ecology.

***Fewer than a million inhabitants*** are often found on newly-colonized worlds, or those with limited arable land. This class has the widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions. ^population-size-fewer-than-million

For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for mutual support and efficient exploitation of land. The atmosphere might be something like that of a village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support large, specialized cities. The major settlement of the planet is usually built around the spaceport.

Politics on planets with so few people tend to be very personal in nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population of a world at a single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and employees can dominate the local social life.

| 6-8  | Several million inhabitants         |
| 9-10 | Hundreds of millions of inhabitants |
|  11  | Billions of inhabitants             |
|  12  | Alien inhabitants                   |



This small population combined with limited outside contact can result in somewhat&hellip;/unusual/ societies more strongly influenced by a leader's personal quirks than a more populous planet might be. Some such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions.

Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up the population of many frontier worlds, usually ones with adequate supplies of arable land and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or filter mask. This level of population is also usually the most that a world at TL4 can support using only artificial hydroponic complexes and sealed agricultural systems, so less hospitable planets rarely have more than this many inhabitants.

At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations start to become present as towns and smaller settlements start to assert their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have much of a framework for resolving these new tensions, and it's not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions.

A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally the smallest population that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds rarely have the broad range of specialists and workers necessary to build such ships, even if they possess the necessary technical information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require the determined focus of the entire society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there enough of an industrial margin to allow for less determined construction of spike drive starships.

***Millions of inhabitants*** are found on some of the more populous frontier worlds, those planets with an excellent climate and soil for agriculture. These worlds teem with human life compared to most of their neighbors, and if they have sufficient technological expertise to build spike drives, they probably are among the significant powers of the sector. The sheer amount of labor and expertise they can put into their projects dwarfs the capabilities of less populated worlds. ^population-size-millions

Some worlds of this type fail to coalesce under a unified planetary government, however, and turn most of their attention to intra-planetary quarrels between different nations or city-states. Full-scale planetary wars have been known to break out on such worlds, with some being reduced to burnt-out cinders by some maltech weapon or by nuclear attacks against regions stripped of their nuke snuffers.

***Billions of inhabitants*** on a world is a freak occurrence in most sectors, a circumstance dependent on almost perfect planetary conditions, a First Wave date of colonization, a very large initial colonial expedition, and a strong cultural imperative for reproduction. These worlds have been colonized for almost a thousand years, and have likely gone through substantial cultural development and change since their founding. ^population-size-billions

Planets with this many inhabitants tend to come in two main varieties. The more common is that of regional hegemon, leveraging its enormous reserves of labor and scientific personnel to build hundreds or thousands of starships. Some hegemons might even have the transport weight and personnel available to colonize or conquer their less powerful neighbors outright, though most hegemons prefer the safer route of docile client states rather than outright conquest.

Not all such worlds have the necessary resources to build starships, even when the labor is cheap and abundant. These worlds tend to take a different route, becoming balkanized, conflict-torn planets not unlike a mid-20th-century Earth. Resource wars are common and local politics revolve around byzantine feuds and ancient slights. Technology on such planets tends to be very uneven; it is limited or nonexistent in fields that depend on unavailable resources, but the natives often show remarkable sophistication in making the most of what they have available.

***Alien civilizations*** are even rarer than massively human-populated planets, but they can be found in some sectors. On these worlds, any human presence is either nonexistent or simply a token contingent of traders and diplomats. The actual number of aliens may range from a few tens of thousands to teeming worlds of billions. ^population-size-alien-civilization

Alien civilizations appear to be no more immune to conflict, disaster, and decadence than that of humans, and most alien worlds are isolated planets. Some sectors were known to be dominated by alien empires before the Scream, but most inhabited worlds found by colonial surveyors consisted of indigenous, lowtech sapients who evolved on the world, or else were the decaying remnants of a former empire that had fallen apart into isolated colonial worlds.

This fate of growth, expansion, colonization, and collapse appears to be a very common event in the galaxy. Countless alien ruins and lost deep-space artifacts indicate that cycles of growth and decay have been going on for millennia, and there is little way to tell how many alien empires have swept over what is now human space before dwindling to rotting worlds and then empty ruins.

## Population Growth

Most worlds have reached an equilibrium state with their current populations. While there may be some variation, few worlds are likely to increase much without a drastic change in the local conditions.

For primitive worlds, this limit has been reached in brutally Malthusian fashion. The locals simply cannot support any substantial increase of their numbers, and additional population is restricted by widespread contraceptive use, selective infanticide, or regular bouts of mass starvation. The only way out of this trap is through advanced technology that can overcome the local resource limitations, after which such worlds might explode in population over a scant few decades.

For more advanced worlds, this limit tends to be organic to the culture. With sophisticated technology to supply abundant entertainment and sustenance, there is less importance in having offspring to labor for the family or nourish its aged members. Individuals become more interested in their own pleasures and ambitions than in the burdensome work of child-rearing, and population tends to slope downward until cultural mores reinforce a certain basic minimum of reproduction. A drastic change in cultural attitudes or an increase in societal uncertainty can alter this rapidly.

## Tech Level

The tech level of a world represents not only the level of technological progress and scientific knowledge available on it, but also the world's ability to translate that knowledge into effective production. A world might still guard texts describing elaborate principles of petrochemical manipulation, but without oil or fossil fuels on the planet they have no way to use the information. It is this kind of resource limitation that most often keeps a world caught at a low level of tech. Without bottleneck resources such as petrochemicals or radioactives, they can't develop the technology that would allow them to do without such resources.

Tech level 4 is the baseline level of development for planets capable of building fusion plants, spike-drive equipped starships, limited longevity enhancements, and basic energy weapons. A planet without this level of development is effectively cut off from interstellar news and trade without the good offices of far traders, explorers, or scavenger fleet contacts.

Tech levels are rough approximations, and every planet is going to have variance within that range. A decayed colony is unlikely to have forgotten the basics of human anatomy and practical wound care, but they may not have the local resources to fashion medical tools more sophisticated than obsidian scalpels and herbal poultices. By the same token, a primitive world might have local resources that are exceptionally useful in one or two narrow ranges of technology.

## Planetary Tech Levels

***Tech level 0*** represents a world with technologies similar to neolithic-era humanity. Very few worlds collapse this far without dying out completely, and so a world this primitive is very rare in human space. The world is so profoundly devoid of useful resources that the natives may simply not have anything better to work with than rocks and native vegetation. ^planetary-tech-level-0

Natives of a world at this tech level might retain elaborate cultural artifacts and a very sophisticated society. Existing resources tend to be exploited to the hilt, with large populations producing massive stone cities, human-powered engines for irrigation, and vast displays of foodstuffs and craft work for the ruling class. Despite this, the lack of metal, domesticated beasts of burden, and petrochemicals puts a hard stop on the technological development of most of these worlds.

Responses to far traders and other interstellar travelers will vary with the local culture. The lack of quick communications methods tends to result in large populations breaking up into numerous smaller regional cultures, and the friendly prince of one domain might neighbor an implacably hostile sage-king. Most “lostworlders” have a keen appreciation for the benefits these strangers from the sky can bring them, and will bargain accordingly.

Some worlds might retain crisply rational records of their colonization and downfall. Others might preserve tales of a starry origin in legends and story. A few might have forgotten their origins entirely, and view sky-born humans as gods or messengers of the divine. Such awe rarely lasts very long once the merchants or pirates who landed make their purposes clear.

***Tech level 1*** worlds have managed to find and exploit metal deposits and likely have imported or domesticated beasts of burden. Those worlds with easy access to fossil fuels or a similarly energy-dense substance can advance to greater things, but a culture trapped at TL1 is unlikely to have access to such helpful resources. A few worlds have enough usable plant matter or other combustibles to make steam engines feasible, but those with very much of such a resource usually make the leap to the next tech level eventually. ^planetary-tech-level-1

As a consequence, tech level 1 worlds tend to be caught at much the same general level of development as their tech level 0 cousins. They may have elaborate social structures and cultural development, but they are unable to mechanize without some energy-dense resource to serve as fuel. The scavenged hulks of their ancestors' fusion plants may stand as mute temples to the achievements of their forebears, but without the tech necessary to repair and rebuild such edifices the world is dependent on purely local fuel sources.

### Table - Tech Types

| 2d6  | Tech Type                                  |
|:----:| ------------------------------------------ |
|  2   | TL0, neolithic-level technology            |
|  3   | TL1, medieval technology                   |
| 4-5  | TL2, early Industrial Age tech             |
| 6-8  | TL4, modern postech                        |
| 9-10 | TL3, tech like that of present-day Earth   |
|  11  | TL4+, postech with specialties             |
|  12  | TL5, pretech with surviving infrastructure |


Tech level 1 worlds tend to respond to visitors in much the same way as tech level 0 planets. The ruling class of these worlds is liable to be able to muster larger cities, bigger armies, and all the other perquisites that come from being able to work the available agricultural land with fewer hands.

***Tech level 2*** worlds are blessed with the presence of fossil fuels or a feasibly abundant biofuel source. Internal combustion engines are crude things compared to the power of a fusion plant, but they can be built with primitive tools and a basic degree of education. The mechanization that results from this resource vastly increases the efficiency of local farming, the speed of travel, and the productivity of factory workers. ^planetary-tech-level-2

Most tech level 2 worlds are “knockdowns”; planets that once had a much higher degree of sophistication but were recently crippled by disease, disaster, or invasion. The natives tend to be keenly aware of the glories of former generations, and work fiercely to redevelop lost techniques and reclaim old knowledge.

Few tech level 2 worlds produce much that's worth interstellar trade. Most foodstuffs are too bulky and cheap to make it worth a captain's time. Some worlds have rare ore deposits, but the natives have no reason to dig them until a merchant makes it worth their while to set up a whole new industry for export. Some such worlds barter the relics of their ancestors in exchange for educational materials or rare resources necessary for advancing local industry. Others feel forced to trade native work contracts for dangerous, dirty labor in a bargain that's little different from slave trading.

***Tech level 3*** worlds are those that have developed to a level much like that of the more advanced nations of late twentieth-century Earth. The main difference between tech level 3 worlds and level 4 worlds is the lack of fusion power or spike drive manufacture. ^planetary-tech-level-3

These worlds come in two major varieties. The first is a “knockdown” world that formerly had tech level 4 technologies before some catastrophe or pirate attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial base. Some of the wrecked infrastructure might have been irreplaceable, and the world must struggle to regain its former level of technological production. Worlds in this condition tend to have rather small populations that are susceptible to the loss of a few concentrated groups of experts.

The second major variety is a world that suffered a severe disaster shortly after colonization and has been forced to painstakingly build up their technological base ever since. Some of these worlds date back to the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago, driven into near-neolithic conditions by some outside pressure before slowly and painfully rebuilding their technological base through purely indigenous efforts. These worlds tend to have very large populations if the world's climate permits, as they have been colonized for quite some time.

Simply providing a world with the necessary technical data for advancement doesn't mean that advancement will be quick or even. Even if a tech level 3 world has the necessary resources to build tech level 4 devices, it may take as much as a generation for a world to build the necessary infrastructure and resource extraction enterprises. The time may be longer still if the dominant cultures are uneasy with the new technology.

***Tech level 4*** worlds are the most common in human space, and their technical expertise is the baseline for modern post-Silence “postech”. These worlds can create spike drives rated up to drive-3, fusion power plants, grav vehicles, simple energy weapons, and medicines that extend human life to a hundred years of vigorous good health. They can manage sophisticated gengineering on simple life forms, and some tech level 4 worlds have even attempted to improve the genetic structures of human life itself. These attempts have yet to produce results without severe drawbacks, but some such worlds remain populated by altered humanity designed to cope with local conditions more perfectly than baseline humans. ^planetary-tech-level-4

Most worlds with regular interstellar contact and the necessary raw resources eventually gravitate towards this level of technological expertise. It may take decades, or even centuries in the case of more retrograde worlds, but this tech level is the highest that can readily be achieved by most planets.

***Tech level 4 with specialties*** is an unusual case of a normal tech level 4 world that has retained some pretech industries or has developed their own local technical expertise beyond baseline postech in certain specific fields. ^planetary-tech-level-4-specialties

Most such specialties are relatively narrow in scope; grav tech, medicine, hydroponics, force field generation, or some field of roughly similar breadth. These specialties are usually either the product of a few irreplaceable pretech manufactories or the result of some unique local resource that serves amazingly well for the purpose at hand. In both cases, the world will jealously guard the tech, and much local conflict may relate to control over these resources.

These worlds tend to have substantial amounts of interstellar trade from neighboring worlds interested in their tech. The ruling elite of the world can be ostentatious about display of this wealth.

***Tech level 5*** is the highest tech level that might merit random placement. A world with this level of technological expertise has somehow managed to hold on to the majority of the pre-Scream technology base, and can produce a wide range of goods that are unknown on less sophisticated worlds. Miniaturized fusion plants, drive-6 rated spike drives, exotic grav weaponry, and even the development of psionics-based “psitech” is possible on such a world. ^planetary-tech-level-5

Pretech manufacturing was largely dependent on specially-trained industrial psychics. With the loss of their unique disciplines in the Scream, most worlds that retain this level of tech classification were forced to substitute slower, less precise methods that sharply curtailed their production efficiency. Barring the profoundly unlikely happenstance of this world's redevelopment of the lost disciplines, their maximum industrial output is sharply limited. Even on worlds such as this, most technology is likely mass-produced postech, with only important goods produced to pretech levels of quality.

A world with this level of technology is almost certainly a regional hegemon, one of the most powerful and influential worlds in the sector. Even those worlds that have no imperial ambitions have enormous influence simply through the vast superiority of their starships and military technology.

## Additional System Points of Interest

The world you're creating is the most interesting or important place in this solar system, but it may not be the only one. If you wish, you can decorate the system with other points of interest worth PC attention. You might do this at the same time you roll up the system's primary world, or you could wait until it becomes a significant point in play.

## Adding Other Worlds

For simplicity's sake, it's often best to just stick with one inhabited world. The original colonists would have chosen the most human-habitable planet in the system, and unless they grew dramatically in the time before the Scream they wouldn't have had reason to colonize less favorable planets before the catastrophe knocked out their spaceflight capabilities. Other rocks might be floating in the system, but they're probably barren and uninhabited.

If you do decide to add additional inhabited planets to the system, you can generate them normally, but you'll want to ask yourself a few special questions. The table below offers some ideas for potential answers.

First, what is the origin of the world, and how does it relate to the primary world in the system? Knowing where this secondary planet's inhabitants came from can often give you answers to a host of other questions.

Second, how do they feel about the primary world? If you generate three or more worlds, you'll want to decide how each of them feels about the other. This feeling may not necessarily be reciprocal.

Third, what's the major point of contact between them and the primary world? If the two are on a friendly basis, this contact might be something that benefits them both, while a more hostile relationship could make it a point they're fighting over or otherwise struggling to maintain dominance in. In the case of a mutual threat, it might be something both are facing with a united front, or it could be the two are struggling to see who gets thrown to the wolves first.

With these three answers in hand you'll be able to flesh out this second planet more easily, adding in elements from the primary world as needed.

## Other Points of Interest

Aside from other inhabited planets, a system can contain a number of other settlements or stations that could draw PC attention. Most of the time these stations can simply be assumed; a TL4 world is going to have asteroid mines and refueling stations and listening posts, and most of these locations have no importance to the game until the PCs go looking for them.

Other times, however, you'll want to pre-seed the system with a few interesting locations. The adjacent table offers a number of different possibilities to roll or choose from.

Most of the points are intended to be remote outposts of the primary world. They might be deep-space research stations, refueling stations on the edge of the system, bases on isolated gas-giant moons that have valuable resources, or other farflung tendrils of a greater civilization.

Some of these points could be more independent establishments. A deep-space existence can be made largely self-sustaining with TL4 engineering, though the life there is likely primitive and tenuous. With enough cobbled-together defenses and a lack of anything particularly worth stealing, exile groups, recluses, and other antisocial sorts can make themselves a private domain that no local planet cares about enough to commit the resources required to destroy it.

Others among these remote stations become outposts for pirates and other reavers, usually operating under some deniable cover or protected by enough defensive installations to dissuade anything short of a major military assault. The calculus for these robbers is simple; the effort a planetary navy would have to make to get rid of them must be more than the cost of tolerating their depredations.

Few of these anarchic outposts last for very long. The stronger and more active they become, the more pressing it is for their victims to take steps to disperse them. Barring some pirate king both charismatic and foolhardy, most such outposts are primed for quick abandonment when a fleet shows up on the sensors.

# ADVENTURE CREATION

After developing one or more worlds, a GM ought to have a fairly substantial list of Friends, Enemies, Places, Complications, and Things appropriate to a given planet. An experienced GM may well be able to assemble an interesting adventure out of these pieces, but even the most practiced designer might be hard-pressed to come up with enough interesting setups to fill out an entire sector.

The method that follows is by no means the best or only way to devise an adventure, but it's a procedure that will do the job for a working GM. This method work best if you've already generated a world using the tools in the Sector Creation chapter, but the basic outlines can function even without such support.

# Identify Your Needs

The first step in creating an adventure is identifying what, precisely, you need the adventure to do. If you've been following the recommended pattern for running your campaign, the last session ended with you asking the players what goal they wanted to pursue next time. If this is for the first adventure to kick off a campaign, you might need something that introduces the players to the setting and gives them a short adventure to get them working together smoothly. If you're creating backup content that you can deploy rapidly when the players catch you off guard, then that might be a third sort of purpose behind your work.

Whatever it is, you need to keep this basic goal in mind as you create the adventure content. Adventures are created to be playable content at the table, so it needs to work for you.

Often, players are somewhat equivocal when they tell you what sort of effort they plan to make for the next session. Sometimes their intentions will be clear and direct, such as pursuing a nemesis who got away from them last time with a cargo hold full of alien artifacts. Other times, it will be something more nebulous, like “Find a good deal on cargo for our ship” or “Explore some of the alien ruins you mentioned were on this world”, or “Do something really unkind to the planetary duke who shot down our starship”.

When things are clear, you'll have an easy time creating an adventure. If they're chasing the nemesis, you know you need to create an adventure revolving around them pursuing this evildoer and encountering plausible challenges on the way. If the guidance you've been given is less precise, more of the details are up to you. You might create an adventure about a “bargain” cargo deal that threatens to go very bad, or draw up an alien ruin for them to explore, or introduce a plucky band of anti-ducal rebels for the PCs to encounter, along with the problems those rebels have. So long as what you're making is logically connected to what they want from you, you'll be able to deliver a fine time at the table.

Sometimes, however, the players ask for something you know is going to be impossible, or something that you know will be rapidly reconsidered by the group. Maybe the nemesis has fled into the bowels of an ultra-high-security orbital citadel, or you know that the duke is actually dying of biopsionic cancer and will be dead in a few more days. If the information is available to the PCs, you can point this out to them and let them reconsider their goals. They might give up on pursuing the nemesis, for example, or change their goal to that of finding some way to penetrate the defenses around the orbital station. It's important not to completely shut down impractical plans, but instead suggest alternate routes that might turn “impossible” into merely “very difficult”.

Be willing to follow the players' lead on alternate routes. If there's not a compelling reason to shoot down an idea or assumption about the world, run with it. If they ask if there are rebels or traitors or spy networks they might be able to contact to get the information they need to crack the defenses, then tell them yes. If the players are going to be kind enough to map out your adventure creation needs for you, let them do the work unless there's a very good reason otherwise.

Other times, however, the players don't have the information they'd need to realize that their intentions are impractical. You know they're going to get ten minutes into the next session before they realize that what they planned to do is totally impossible. You can't write them an adventure that gives them a chance of succeeding at the goal, not without violating common sense or already-established game world facts, so what do you do in such situations? There are two general ways to handle this: anticipate their next course of action, or prepare filler content.

There are times when you can tell that the players are going to hit the obstacle and immediately look for a way around it. Maybe they discover the nemesis has fled to the orbital at the start of the next adventure, but a convenient NPC suggests that there's a way to get the passcodes onto the station if the PCs are able to contact a certain information broker. You write the adventure to help you handle the PCs' attempts to find and convince the broker to help them, because you're confident that the group isn't going to just shrug and let the nemesis go.

On other occasions, however, you don't have that confidence. You really aren't sure what the PCs will decide to do when they see their initial goal is impractical. In this case, you write some filler content, designed to give the players something fun to do for the session while they figure out their next plan. This sort of filler content can often be written far in advance of its actual need, and over the course of a long campaign it's likely you'll end up with several sessions worth of this prep work kept ready in your GM folder, available for deployment whenever the PCs start doing things you're not prepared to handle yet. This section will include some specific advice on how to build this kind of filler content and how to insert it into play.

In the end, the goal at this stage is to have a clear idea of what sort of content you need to have prepped for the next session. Once you know what kind of material you need to make, you can go on to the next stage.

# Choose Ingredients

The next step in creating the adventure is to look back at your sector information and the tags and elements you've rolled up for the planet the PCs are on. You've already created some NPCs, complications, and places to work with, so now's your chance to take advantage of your preparations. If the PCs are somewhere that hasn't had that work done already, take a moment to fabricate an appropriate Friend, Enemy, Complication, Thing, and Place suitable for the setting. You'll use these ingredients to create the adventure in the next step.

While you can pull the ingredients directly from your sector file, you can also take a moment to customize them to the situation. Maybe there's a particular NPC you know is going to show up next time, given the party's ambitions, or there's a specific macguffin that's in circulation right now. You can adjust these ingredients to fit the specific circumstances and help smooth transitions between adventures. The same people can keep showing up when it's logical that they'd be involved, and the other elements can persist to help give a sense of continuity to events.

It's also useful to pull in regular callbacks from prior adventures. The things that PCs do have consequences, and sometimes those consequences persist for quite some time. Try to put at least one callback to prior events or people into each adventure, even if it's just a cameo from an NPC, or a newsflash giving up-to-date reporting on some situation the PCs were involved in. The more that the PCs feel like they're really making a difference in the campaign world, the more engaged they're going to be with the setting.

Try to make sure that the ingredients you use are logical and coherent elements of your campaign setting. Pulling antagonists or macguffins from the starry void can be convenient, but an ingredient that just comes out of nowhere, with no foreshadowing or visible connection to the rest of the campaign, is an ingredient that some groups might find jarring and difficult to interact with. In the absence of some visible connection to the rest of the campaign, it's hard for a party to get their hands around an ingredient and deduce intelligent, rational ways to interact with it. A planetary tyrant they've known about for a few sessions is much easier to deal with than an alien overlord fresh out of drillspace, because the tyrant is part of a setting and context they've had a chance to understand.

# Assemble the Outline

With the adventure ingredients in hand, it's time to put together the basic outline of the adventure. An outline isn't meant to fill in every detail and supply every fact you need to run the adventure, but merely to give you a basic idea of the adventure's premise and point out the kind of information you'll need to prepare for play.

If you're pressed for time and don't feel like assembling your own outline, flip forward in this section to a list of one hundred plot seeds. Take your Friends, Enemies, Complications, and other world elements and slot them into a seed that looks appropriate to your needs. You now have your outline and can skip to the next step in creating the adventure.

If you'd rather spend more time developing the outline, you'll want to pick three basic elements to make up its essential frame. Not every adventure involves all three elements, but usually you'll need representative examples of each. You'll need a ***Problem*** to drive the adventure, a - ***Person*** to serve as an antagonist or point of entry to the Problem, and you'll need a ***Place*** to set the events as they play out.

Your Problem is the core of your adventure, and is an unstable or untenable situation that the PCs can meaningfully affect. The players aren't going to care about problems so big or so intractable that their actions won't have any consequential effect. They're going to be engaged with problems small enough, or specific enough, that they feel that their choices can really change the outcome.

Some Problems are self-attractive to the players. If the party wants to explore an alien ruin on this world, then simply putting an unexplored alien art museum where they can get at it will be enticement enough. The Problem is that the PCs want what's inside the museum, but there are some dangers or difficulties that are preventing them from plundering its age-old secrets. Your job in that case will be to make the overcoming of those difficulties interesting enough to satisfy the players. Whenever you have a situation where the players want X, your Problem can simply consist of placing X and then making it plausibly difficult to get to.

Other times, this isn't going to be enough. Perhaps, the planet's savage water barons are locked in a bloody struggle over control of the ancient Mandate-era hydroforming installation, control of which will leave one of them the undisputed master of the arid world. Certainly, the services of a small band of recklessly courageous adventurers could be vital in penetrating the installation's automatic defenses, but why should the players care which tattooed savage gets to be master?

The Person is your way of connecting the players with the Problem, when the Problem is not one that naturally attracts their interest. The Person provides the human connection between the party and the situation, either through being a sympathetic figure who appeals to the group's desire to help, or through being a dangerous antagonist who forces a response.

Of course, an adventure can involve more than one important NPC, and the players might end up with multiple reasons to engage with the Problem. But by focusing on at least one important Person, you make sure that the players have a real reason to care about the Problem and provide yourself with a contact point through which to pass on information about the situation. Even an antagonist can serve as a useful chance to dump setting info on the players and clue them in to adventure opportunities. A blood-distilling water baron who wipes out a sand village that helped the party in an earlier adventure informs the players not only that the water barons *exist* on the world, but that this particular vampire warlord is on his way to seize the hydroforming station.

At this stage, pick one Person to be the connection between the Problem and getting the PCs directly involved. Give them a name and a sentence or so describing how they're going to pull the PCs in, but don't worry about fleshing them out further at this point. You might add additional people to the mix if you know there are certain other NPCs you want to involve in the situation, but you can delay this to the next step.

Finally, you need to choose a Place where this adventure is going to take place. Some sessions will occur in multiple Places, with the heroes gallivanting around the planet or solar system to deal with the Problem in multiple locations, but every adventure needs at least one Place to contain the action.

Sometimes the Place itself is the focus of the action. If the PCs are looting an alien art museum, then the museum itself is going to be the major element of importance in the adventure. You're going to have to make it a sufficiently interesting, complex, and engaging location to support a full session's adventure.

Other times, the Place is just a backdrop to the action. A Problem involving tribal warfare in the steaming xeno-jungles of some gas giant moon might have the terrain be a factor in things, but the jungle itself is not expected to be interesting enough to keep the players occupied with no further action. In these situations, the Place informs and shapes the Problem and gives color and flavor to events, but you don't have to build it out into playable content by itself.

For now, define the Place that contains the Problem and make sure they're connected in some way. Even if the Place is just giving flavor and style cues to the Problem, it should be clear to the players that whatever is going on here is a thing that is going on in *this particular* Place. Make the tribal warfare the kind that would occur in a jungle, with swift canoes fashioned of giant beetle shells and ambushes that take advantage of the perils of the alien jungle. The more the Place affects what is happening, the more it matters to the game.

Once you've chosen a Problem to deal with, a Person to connect the party with the situation, and a Place where all of this is going to unfold, you're ready to move on to the next step in creating your adventure.

# Fleshing It Out

You know the basic outline of the adventure, so this stage is where you add the extra information you need to actually play it out at the table. Some GMs need very little of this, and can improvise an evening's play out of nothing more than an outline and a few sketched notes. Most GMs require a little more preparation to be comfortable with running an adventure. As you go through this process, let your own comfort level be your guide on how detailed and elaborate your preparation work should be, but make sure to cover the basic, critical parts of the adventure first before you spend time detailing contingencies and what-ifs.

To start the process, ask yourself the following questions to determine what sort of preparation work you need to do.

***What maps do I need?*** If you expect the PCs to assault a location, you're going to need a map good enough to support that. You can pull something close off the web, scribble in any tweaks needed for your adventure, and use it accordingly. Maybe the abandoned missile silo plans you've downloaded are actually being used as a hidey-hole for a rebel leader, but all it takes is a few coats of GM paint and the players won't know the difference.

The more carefully and intently the PCs are going to be interacting with a site, the more you're going to need a map for it. A tense political meeting that takes place on some orbital resort station might not need a map at all if the focus is around the politics of it. If you know a terrorist group is going to bomb the talks and try to assassinate the diplomats, however, then you're going to need enough of a map to support the PCs' inevitable attempts to foil or escape the bloodshed.

***What places do I need to make interesting?*** This is a special case that you'll run into when the adventure involves exploring a site. A simple diagram of a location is all you need to run a firefight there, but when the thrust of the adventure involves plumbing the unknown mysteries of a site, there better be some halfway-decent mysteries there to plumb. There should be perilous dangers, satisfying rewards, and interesting gubbins to manipulate in the place, elements informed by the map's nature and origins. If the PCs are exploring a Chittik hive-station, they ought to be finding things that make sense in the context of a man-eating alien beetle home, while an abandoned Mandate control center should be full of the dusty relics of that lost star-spanning human empire.

The art of creating an interesting site to explore is worth a book in itself, but the tools later in this chapter can help give you some ideas. Another useful source of inspiration exists in countless old-school fantasy adventure modules; just dig through them for interesting setpieces, reskin them as super-science, and flavor them with the style of whatever place they're in. Never hesitate to plunder existing content for your game. You are but one GM, and your time and effort are finite.

***What NPCs will I need to detail?*** When you detail an NPC, you give them a hook, a motivation, a want, and a power. The hook is simply some visual or behavioral detail that will help them stick in the players' memory. Reeking cigars, chrome-plated fingers, a habit of finishing every sentence with 'you think?', or any other unique detail can help the players remember them when a name might slide off their recollections. These hooks also give you a hint for descriptive detail when you're playing out an encounter with the PCs.

A motivation is simply that; what the NPC wants from life, what immediate goal or ambition they have. Often, this is related to the Problem; the NPC wants a particular outcome from the situation. Sometimes this is a broader life goal, like the desire for vast wealth, or a particular person's love, or revenge on an enemy. A want is what they want specifically from the PCs. Usually this is something that helps them achieve their motivation, some assistance the PCs can give or action they can take that will further the NPC's motivation. A power is what they can do to help or harm the PCs, whether that consists of giving vital info, exerting their influence for or against the PCs, or simply the threat of their physical violence against the party. An NPC's power is why the PCs should care about their want.

Give the NPC combat statistics at this point if you think it likely they're going to get in a fight. Remember that most people in the galaxy are normal human beings with no unique combat prowess. Just because an NPC is the president of a megacorp doesn't necessarily mean he's got more than 1 hit die, especially if he's led a life otherwise insulated from physical danger and threats to his life.

***What default outcomes will you need to establish?*** In an unstable situation, it's assumed that events will shake out a certain way if the PCs don't get involved, or don't try to redirect events a particular way. Take a moment to decide what's going to happen in the adventure if the players don't change things. How will the situation resolve itself, and what will happen to the NPCs involved? If there's a particular timeline to the adventure, when certain things will happen at certain times, note it down.

If the adventure is especially time-sensitive, make sure the PCs are given adequate warning about it.

While the party might reasonably be expected to understand that a tribal assault on a fortified desert community isn't going to continue forever, if the town is going to collapse in three hours then they need to know that every minute counts. Let NPCs warn them of the dwindling resistance, let the enemies make visible progress toward success, and otherwise ensure that the natural warnings inherent in the situation are properly passed on to the players. They can't realize how serious a situation is if the GM won't tell them what their PCs can see.

***What are the rewards to dealing with the Problem?*** You need to figure out what exactly the PCs are supposed to be getting out of their efforts. If they're plundering an alien treasure-house, what exactly are they going to find there? If they save the desert community, what kind of help or reward do they receive? Is there some way that solving this Problem will advance a PC's personal goals? Sometimes the reward of a situation is simply avoiding some terrible outcome, but too many of these charity jobs or self-defense adventures can leave the players feeling like chumps.

Determining the rewards in experience points, cash, or plunder can be delicate, so there's a separate section in this chapter devoted to helping you do just that. Your choice will depend largely on how quickly you want the PCs to advance in personal power and how plausible it is that a given situation might offer a considerable reward.

***Lastly, how will the PCs get involved?*** You've got a Person to hook them in, or the Problem itself is attractive to the PCs, but how exactly are you going to connect the players to the adventure? Figure out the details of how you're going to introduce the adventure to the players and take note of the information, resources, and situation they'll encounter when they step into the scenario.

# Polish It Up

You're almost finished with your adventure. All you need to do now is put yourself in your party's shoes and think about how they're likely to experience the adventure. You know your players better than any author could, so you know the ways they're likely to react to NPCs, how they like to deal with problems, and what sort of things make them sympathetic or angry. Don't worry about some platonic Ideal Adventurer when you're doing a mental walkthrough of the adventure. Worry about the people you know are going to be playing this.

If you've created a sandbox-style adventure with the steps above, there won't be any written-out “path” through the adventure. You'll have a situation, some NPCs, and the resources you need to handle the players interacting with that situation. Maybe they'll resolve it to their liking, and maybe they'll end the session by booking a fast ship offplanet with a furious mob at their heels. Your only concern at this stage is making sure the adventure is logical, approachable, and engaging.

Is the adventure logical? If your adventure is contradicting facts that have already been established about the world, the players are going to want to see a good reason for it. If they break into a slum warehouse to find it full of elite special-ops combatants, they're going to want a very good explanation for such a seemingly-irrational encounter. They don't have to see every explanation or understand every dramatic deviation from reasonable expectations, but *you* should know these reasons, and the players should be confident that the reasons exist.

If you design an adventure by “story logic”, where the most important thing is maintaining a genre feel and good adventure pacing, the players are going to react in story-logical ways. When presented with an obstacle, they're going to assume that their heroes are expected to have a reasonable chance to overcome that obstacle. When faced with a dangerous combat foe, they're going to assume the enemy is at least theoretically beatable by the group, and when encountering a seemingly-invincible challenge, they're going to look around for the right story levers to pull to make it somewhat more vincible. This style of running a game is perfectly valid, and it is indeed preferable for groups that want to maintain a certain genre feel, but it's not usually how ***Stars Without Number*** adventures get made.

The default ***Stars Without Number*** assumption is that adventures operate on established setting logic.

If something should be somewhere, it is, whether or not the PCs can hope to overcome it. If an ally is locked away in the bowels of a max-security prison, the PCs might simply not have any reasonable way to get them out unless they can change the situation through supplemental adventures. When the PCs see a terrifyingly dangerous foe, that foe *really is* terrifyingly dangerous, and some PCs are almost certainly going to die if they decide to fight. The PCs have no cosmic authorial protection, and if they put themselves in no-win situations, they are going to lose.

With that in mind, look at your adventure and make sure it is not the sort of challenge or situation that would only be essayed by someone convinced that they are the first-book protagonist of a sci-fi trilogy. Don't expect the PCs to do unreasonable things or face ridiculous obstacles just because they're part of the adventure. A canny player group will make a point of avoiding unjustified perils and staying *well clear* of unbeatable difficulties. They won't bite on your adventure if it seems a fast-track journey to an unmarked grave.

Is the adventure approachable? This has to do with your hook and the overall appeal of the situation. What is it about this situation that's going to pique player interest? Knowing what you know about your players, is this the sort of thing they're going to jump into? Even if you're confident that the players will want to get involved, you need to make sure they have a clear way into the situation. If it's a roil of political intrigue, give them somebody to contact. If it's a mysterious alien ruin, give them a map to it.

It's not your job to develop a clear route through the adventure, a step-by-step sequence of events that can predictably lead to success. It is, however, your job to give the PCs a way to get involved in the situation. If you can't see an obvious “first step” to the adventure, then it's unlikely your players will be able to see one.

Is the adventure engaging? An adventure which is about something fundamentally uninteresting to the players is just not going to hold their attention. Good sports will try to get through it simply because it's what you created for them, but other players will start playing with their phones, talking about extraneous matters, or just doing something else in-game. Even if the PCs have a logical reason to care about the adventure, if the *players* are not invested, they aren't going to have a very good time.

To build engagement, use elements your players love and elements your players hate. What do your players really like? What kind of NPCs, situations, and activities do they really enjoy? Don't worry about abstract players, just think about the specific people you are playing with. Conversely, what kind of villains do they absolutely despise? What sort of evildoing gets them fired up with righteous wrath? It's important not to push things into gratuitous grimdark, but if you have some players who really hate slavers, then that's a good cue to make beating down slavers an element in an adventure.

Once you've polished up the adventure, done a mental walk-through of events, and ensured that it is logical, approachable, and engaging, then you're ready to play.

# Creating Filler Adventures

Sometimes a GM gets caught flat-footed by the players. They do something or choose a goal that the GM is totally unprepared to manage. A GM is well within their rights to call a pause and explain to the players that they're just not ready to handle that yet, and if the players want to do it, they can do it next session, after the GM has had time to prep something for it.

Other times, however, the GM will just throw in a quick *filler adventure*. These are adventures built expressly for running when the GM is caught by surprise or runs out of prepared content for the evening. Filler adventures are built much like any other adventure, but their priorities are different. Filler adventures should be insistent, short, and simple.

The adventure needs to be insistent; it needs to present a situation that the PCs absolutely must deal with right this minute. A terrorist attack, a criminal stealing a PC macguffin, a friend frantically calling for help&hellip; the adventure needs to grab the PCs and distract them from whatever it was they were trying to do.

Even so, the adventure should be short. A filler adventure shouldn't take longer to complete than it takes for you to come up with a good response to the players' initial goal. You just need to keep the players entertained long enough for you to figure out what you're going to do, so a filler adventure shouldn't eat up more than a session at most.

Lastly, the adventure should be simple. Don't burn yourself out on complex entanglements and relations to the existing adventure. If you can come up with a good tie-in quickly, great, but the ideal filler adventure is general enough to slot in almost anywhere.

Unused bits and pieces of your regular adventures can be used as filler components. Don't waste your work; if the PCs haven't seen it, save it for later use.

# Adventure Rewards

Player characters all have their own reasons for seeking adventure in the trackless void, but pragmatic rewards of wealth, power, and influence tend to be popular. When designing your adventures, how should you apportion rewards, whether in experience points, pretech artifacts, or credits?

# Rewarding Credits

The first thing to understand about the credit economy in your campaign is that “too much money” is not a significant problem to have. Unlike many types of games, there's really nothing the PCs can do with large amounts of money that will allow them to drastically improve their own personal power. They can hire minions, they can buy starships, they can get cyberware, and they can use their wealth as a bludgeon of influence, but at the end of the day they still basically have the same character sheet as before.

In the same vein, in a sandbox campaign there is no storyline to disrupt. If the PCs suddenly luck into a stellar tyrant's ransom, then the campaign is about what they do with the money. Maybe it lets them casually crush the problems they used to have, but now they've got an entirely new set of concerns befitting their newfound wealth. Unless the PCs simply decide to stop adventuring after a lucky strike, their future campaign sessions will simply be flavored with great wealth and the problems and possibilities that come along with it.

So don't worry about “keeping the PCs hungry”. Just let them acquire the logical amount of money that their deeds and situation would earn them. If they do a significant favor for a megacorp CEO, they should be earning a lot more than they'd get from the heartfelt gratitude of a lostworlder peasant whose life they saved.

With that in mind, here's an adjacent list of reasonable credit amounts that can be applied to adventures. If the PCs do work for someone, they'll get paid to the extent that they earned it and the patron can afford it. If they come across lost loot or valuable cargo, you can use these numbers to gauge what a “big haul” would be to most people in the setting.

# Rewarding Ships and Major Items

Most groups are going to want to get their own starship relatively early on in the campaign. You might even have the acquisition of a beaten-up merchant ship be the result of the introductory adventure. While it's certainly possible for a scifi campaign to spend most of its time on a single world or for PCs to hitch rides with allies and existing transport ships, most players are going to want to get their own set of thrusters.

The basic guideline for rewarding a ship or any other major piece of hardware is that it's going to take at least one session of adventure to get it, assuming you think it's reasonable to allow it in the first place. The PCs are going to have to come up with a plan or look for an opportunity to grab the thing they want if they don't have the money to buy it outright.

You can use this principle when the PCs want anything, whether it's a ship, a particular ally, a base of operations, or anything else that can't reasonably buy. Make them adventure for it. You can give them suggestions and ideas, but it's up to them to come up with a plan for getting their hands on what they want.

Once they've done that, all you need to do is make up an adventure revolving around their efforts, and you've got your evening's entertainment. As always, you should be watchful for opportunities to make PC ambitions into easy adventure outlines.

### Table - Reward Types

| Reward Type                               |    Amount |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------:|
| A lot of money to a slum dweller          |        50 |
| Slum dweller's maximum funds              |       100 |
| A lot of money to an ordinary worker      |       500 |
| Ordinary worker's maximum funds           |     1,000 |
| A lot of money to an affluent person      |     2,500 |
| Affluent person's maximum funds           |     5,000 |
| A lot of money to a wealthy person        |    25,000 |
| Wealthy person's maximum funds            |   100,000 |
| A lot of money to an oligarch             | 1 million |
| Oligarch's available liquid funds         | 5 million |
| Moderately-skilled short contract work    |  20 / day |
| An illegal but not serious crime job      |       500 |
| Serious but non-capital criminal job      |     1,000 |
| Kill someone who isn't very important     |     5,000 |
| Kill a significant or well-guarded target |    50,000 |
| Kill a major government official          |   250,000 |


# Rewarding Experience Points

There are several different methods to award experience points. The one you choose will depend largely on the kind of campaign you want to run and the speed of advancement you want for the PCs.

The basic experience award for each member of a party is three points. This assumes a fairly fast rate of advancement, with PCs reaching second level after their first award. If you want a slower one, drop it to two points, or even one. All members of the group should get the same basic award unless you want PCs of different levels in your group.

When do you hand out this basic award? You have several different choices.

***Use a session-based system.*** Hand out the award at the end of every gaming session, assuming the PCs were trying to accomplish something worthy of their skills. Parties that coast along without facing any real challenges might not receive the award.

***Use a personal goal-based system.*** Have every PC list at least one long-term goal and one short-term goal. If they achieve a short-term goal during the session, give them a basic award. If they manage to succeed at a long-term goal, give them triple that amount of experience. Different characters can share the same goals if they wish, and it's up to the GM to decide whether or not a particular goal is challenging enough to deserve a reward. PCs can pick new goals or change old ones at the end of each session.

Note that if you use this method different PCs will advance at different rates, depending on how often they reach their goals. This isn't a problem if the group is fine with it, and if PCs work to make sure the party isn't focusing too much on the goals of only a few members. If you want to help encourage spreading the focus around, you can rule that no PC can get goal XP again until someone else in the group has achieved a goal.

***Use a mission-based system.*** Have the group agree on a mission or goal at the end of each session or at the start of the campaign. When the group reaches that goal, they all get an experience award. They can choose to change their goal at the end of every session, or pick a new one if they've attained their original purpose. If they choose a particularly hard mission they might get an extra bonus, at the cost of a greater risk of failure.

***Use a loot-based system.*** This sort of campaign doesn't use experience points. Instead, it uses cash. Every PC needs to earn 5,000 credits of liquid funds in rewards or loot before reaching second level. Then they need to earn 10,000 more to reach third, 20,000 more to reach fourth, and so on, with the new amount needed doubling at each level. Only wealth they've earned adventuring and converted into spendable credits counts toward this amount.

Once a PC gains a level, their running “score” is reset to zero, and even huge hauls can't boost them more than one level at a time.

This experience method strongly incentivizes ruthless plundering, and might result in uneven advancement if the party doesn't split their earnings evenly. It does make for a laser-focused game of freebooting avarice, however.

***Use a spending-based system.*** This works the same way as the loot-based system, but the credits they earn only count if the PC *spends* them. Credits spent on personal equipment, cyberware, vehicles, or other directly useful items don't count. Only credits “wasted” in revelry, charity, supporting some NPC cause, building a power base, or otherwise interacting with the game world count toward the PC's advancement.

This, too, can result in a party with PCs of varying character level over time, as some choose to buy hardware and others elect to “waste” the money. It does encourage a great deal of engagement, however.

# Creating Problems

Every Problem boils down to a fundamental conflict. A person wants something and they can't have it, or they don't want something and are being forced to accept it, or they have something and it's being threatened, or they want something and someone else wants it too. At the bottom of every Problem there's a conflict the PCs can engage. These tables on the following pages provide some cues for generating Problems for your adventures.

First, roll 1d8, 1d10, and 1d10 on the Conflict Type table. The first roll gives you an idea of the general type of conflict at the bottom of the adventure. It might be a matter of money, old grudges, a natural catastrophe, ethnic struggles, or one of several other root causes. You can stop at this point if the cue is sufficiently inspirational.

Otherwise, the next roll gives you the overall situation of the conflict. This is the backdrop to the adventure, and while the PCs may not be able to resolve the entire conflict, they should be able to make a difference in this particular skirmish. You can take this general context and decide on a specific event or situation that's causing the conflict at the heart of the Problem.

If further inspiration is needed, the third roll gives you a specific focus for the Problem. Something is happening, and there are at least two sides involved; one that is in favor of what is happening, and one that is opposed. Just put forces on both sides of the focus and you'll have your starting Problem.

Some Problems have the PCs on one of the sides. If “Money was stolen from someone” and “The PCs are owed it”, then the PCs themselves will have a powerful incentive to involve themselves in the conflict. Other Problems only have people on one side; if there's a catastrophic natural disaster, the disaster itself is unlikely to have motivations or goals, while the hapless victims doubtless are struggling to survive.

To add further decoration to the circumstances, you can roll on the tables below. The Restraint table gives you a reason why the conflict hasn't boiled over yet, and why the PCs might be a wildcard that can resolve the problem at hand. Some Problems can keep a long time with a sufficiently stern Restraint, which makes them convenient when you need to make filler adventures that can stay in storage until you need them.

The Twist table gives you a turn you can add to the Problem, something to complicate the situation and shake up easy assumptions about how it will play out.

At all times, you should be looking for chances to insert elements you've already created for this world. Use Enemies for antagonists, Friends for allies, and slip in Complications when you need additional twists. GMing is tough enough without making extra work.

# Creating People

You'll need People to help the PCs get involved in your adventure and to flesh out the personalities and important figures in the Problem. Not every NPC needs to be worked up fully, but it can be convenient to have a few spare People around to drop in when the players suddenly take an interest in a bit-player NPC you never expected they'd focus on.

To generate a Person, start with their motivation. This is what the Person wants out of life, their major focus and drive. The deals they offer and the actions they take should revolve around this motivation. Different people will go to different extremes to follow this motivation, so you shouldn't feel obligated to make it a monomania for them, but it's the basic driver of their actions.

Next, pick a want. This is the immediate thing the NPC thinks will most effectively advance their motivation. If the latter is “Promote a friend or offspring's career” and the want is “Burn down or destroy a particular structure”, then you simply have to figure out how burning down that place is going to advance the NPC's daughter's career. The want is what the NPC is most likely to desire the PCs to help them achieve.

Now determine their power. This is what the NPC can use to pay off the PCs or threaten them into compliance. If a Person hasn't got any power to help or harm the party, the PCs aren't going to have much motivation to care about their wants. Not every NPC will have *much* power, but they should all be able to do something to help or hinder the PCs.

Then you determine a hook, a visual or character quirk that will help you describe them during play and help the players remember who they are.

Lastly, if you want to make life a little easier for yourself, you can roll or pick an initial manner of approach and a default deal outcome for the Person. These additional tables help smooth out the handling of PC deals and negotiations with the NPC.

The initial manner is simply how the NPC will deal with the PCs during their initial meeting. Maybe they'll be effusively appreciative of the party's capabilities, or maybe they'll be full of thin-lipped disapproval, but their manner can give you some cues for playing out the NPC's interactions with the party.

The default deal outcome can give you a cue as to how or if the NPC will keep any deal they make with the PCs. In some cases, you'll already know whether or not the NPC will play fair with the party, either because you know they're essentially trustworthy people or you know they're double-dipped bastards. The table is convenient when you're not quite sure if an NPC is as good as their word.

# Creating Places

Places can be very simple to create or very complex. If a Place is only needed as a backdrop for events and you don't expect the PCs to spend much time exploring it, you really don't need anything more than a name and a few sentences of description for the table. If it's to be an alien ruin, enemy base, or some other structure that the PCs are going to carefully interact with, you'll need something more interesting.

For the former type of place, just pull an appropriate Place from the world generation data you've already created. You can then give it some background activity from the table below. If it's an urban, civilized sort of location, you can roll for a Civilized Ongoing to indicate what's happening there right now. If it's a lost ruin, wilderness glade, or other wild place, roll or pick from the Wilderness Ongoings list.

If the PCs plan to investigate the place, you'll want a Reward to determine what worthwhile thing the PCs might find there. In some cases, you'll already know what the Reward should be; if the PCs are going into an alien ruin to dig out a lost macguffin, then the macguffin itself will be the reward. You can still use the Reward table to create some secondary loot prospects in the place if you wish, the better to reward careful exploration and creative overcoming of the area's inevitable hazards.

Those hazards can be derived from the opposite table. The first roll gives a general type of hazard that the PCs will have to face in an area or sub-area of the Place, while the specific examples and possible dangers provide more concrete suggestions.

You can apply these hazards to specific parts of the Place, or if the area is too small to sustain much mayhem, you might roll once and apply it generally to the entire location.

One of the easiest ways to quickly produce an interesting area to explore is to go online and loot the web for old-school-style fantasy adventure modules. In many cases, the maps and floor plans can be stolen outright, while the room contents can be reskinned with suitably sci-fi flavor. Most of these old adventures use game mechanics that are similar to those used by ***Stars Without Number***, such as hit points, Armor Classes, damage rolls, and gold piece values that can easily be converted to credits. If you mix and match these components, using pieces from multiple adventures to stitch together what you need, even those players who might have experienced the original adventure won't be able to recognize your handiwork.

This principle of constructive looting is important to any sandbox GM. Save creative energy for where it counts. Everywhere else, plunder without shame.

# ADVENTURE SEEDS

The hundred ideas that follow are basic outlines for various adventures. Just take the components you've rolled for a given planet, slot them in the spaces noted in the adventure seeds, and build out from there to create an evening's entertainment. If you want something more complicated than these basic seeds provide, you can string several of them together, gluing them into a single perilous circumstance to occupy the heroes.

As a general rule of thumb, a single seed should occupy the group for a single session's worth of adventure. If you need to create more content than that, you can scale events by adding additional complications or breaking the adventure up into several additional tasks or obstacles that must be overcome before the PCs can successfully resolve it.

1. An Enemy seeks to rob a Friend of some precious Thing that he has desired for some time.

2. A Thing has been discovered on property owned by a Friend, but a Complication risks its destruction.

3. A Complication suddenly hits the party while they're out doing some innocuous activity.

4. The players unwittingly offend or injure an Enemy, incurring his or her wrath. A Friend offers help in escaping the consequences.

5. Rumor speaks of the discovery of a precious Thing in a distant Place. The players must get to it before an Enemy does.

6. An Enemy has connections with offworld pirates or slavers, and a Friend has been captured by them.

7. A Place has been seized by violent revolutionaries or rebels, and a Friend is being held hostage by them.

8. A Friend is in love with someone forbidden by social convention, and the two of them need help eloping.

9. An Enemy wields tyrannical power over a Friend, relying on the bribery of corrupt local officials to escape consequences.

10. A Friend has been lost in hostile wilderness, and the party must reach a Place to rescue them in the teeth of a dangerous Complication.

11. An Enemy has committed a grave offense against a PC or their family sometime in the past. A Friend shows the party a weakness in the Enemy's defenses.

12. The party is suddenly caught in a conflict between two warring families or political parties.

13. The party is framed for a crime by an Enemy, and must reach the sanctuary of a Place before they can regroup and find the Thing that will prove their innocence and their Enemy's perfidy.

14. A Friend is threatened by a tragedy of sickness, legal calamity, or public humiliation, and the only one that seems able to save them is an Enemy.

15. A natural disaster or similar Complication strikes a Place while the party is present, causing great loss of life and property unless the party is able to immediately respond to the injured and trapped.

16. A Friend with a young business has struck a cache of pretech, valuable minerals, or precious salvage. He needs the party to help him reach the Place where the valuables are.

17. An oppressed segment of society starts a sudden revolt in the Place the party is occupying. An Enemy simply lumps the party in with the rebels and tries to put the revolt down with force. A Friend offers them a way to either help the rebels or clear their names.

18. A vulnerable Friend has been targeted for abduction, and has need of guards. A sudden Complication makes guarding them from the Enemy seeking their kidnapping much more difficult. If the Friend is snatched, they must rescue them from a Place.

19. A mysterious Place offers the promise of some precious Thing, but access is very dangerous due to wildlife, hostile locals, or a dangerous environment.

20. An Enemy and a Friend both have legal claim on a Thing, and seek to undermine each other's case. The Enemy is willing to do murder if he thinks he can get away with it.

21. An Enemy seeks the death of his brother, a Friend, by arranging the failure of his grav flyer or shuttlecraft in dangerous terrain while the party is coincidentally aboard. The party must survive the environment and bring proof of the crime out with them.

22. A Friend seeks to slip word to a lover, one who is also being courted by the Friend's brother, who is an Enemy. A Complication threatens to cause death or disgrace to the lover unless they either accept the Enemy's suit or are helped by the party.

23. An Enemy is convinced that one of the party has committed adultery with their flirtatious spouse. He means to lure them to a Place, trap them, and have them killed by the dangers there.

24. An Enemy has been driven insane by exotic recreational drugs or excessive psionic torching. He fixes on a PC as being his mortal nemesis, and plots elaborate deaths, attempting to conceal his involvement amid Complications.

25. A Friend has stolen a precious Thing from an Enemy and fled into a dangerous, inaccessible Place. The party must rescue them, and decide what to do with the Thing and the outraged Enemy.

26. An Enemy has realized that their brother or sister has engaged in a socially unacceptable affair with a Friend, and means to kill both of them unless stopped by the party.

27. A Friend has accidentally caused the death of a family member, and wants the party to help him hide the body or fake an accidental death before his family realizes what has happened. A Complication suddenly makes the task more difficult.

28. A Friend is a follower of a zealous ideologue who plans to make a violent demonstration of the righteousness of his cause, causing a social Complication. The Friend will surely be killed in the aftermath if not rescued or protected by the party.

29. A Friend's sibling is to be placed in a dangerous situation they've got no chance of surviving. The Friend takes their place at the last moment, and will almost certainly die unless the party aids them.

30. Suicide bombers detonate an explosive, chemical, or biological weapon in a Place occupied by the party where a precious Thing is stored The PCs must escape before the Place collapses on top of them, navigating throngs of terrified people in the process and saving the Thing if possible.

31. An Enemy who controls landing permits, oxygen rations, or some other important resource has a prejudice against one or more of the party members. He demands that they bring him a Thing from a dangerous Place before he'll give them the goods.

32. A Friend in a loveless marriage to an Enemy seeks escape to be with their beloved, and contacts the party to snatch them from their spouse's guards at a prearranged Place.

33. A Friend seeks to elope with their lover, and contacts the party to help them meet their paramour at a remote, dangerous Place. On arrival, they find that the lover is secretly an Enemy desirous of their removal and merely lured them to the place to meet their doom.

34. The party receives or finds a Thing which proves the crimes of an Enemy- yet a Friend was complicit in the crimes, and will be punished as well if the authorities are involved. And the Enemy will stop at nothing to get the item back.

35. A Friend needs to get to a Place on time in order to complete a business contract, but an Enemy means to delay and hinder them until it's too late, inducing Complications to the trip.

36. A locked pretech stasis pod has been discovered by a Friend, along with directions to the hidden keycode that will open it. The Place where the keycode is hidden is now owned by an Enemy.

37. A fierce schism has broken out in the local majority religion, and an Enemy is making a play to take control of the local hierarchy. A Friend is on the side that will lose badly if the Enemy succeeds, and needs a Thing to prove the other group's error.

38. A former Enemy has been given reason to repent his treatment of a Friend, and secretly commissions them to help the Friend overcome a Complication. A different Enemy discovers the connection, and tries to paint the PCs as double agents.

39. An alien or a human with extremely peculiar spiritual beliefs seeks to visit a Place for their own reasons. An Enemy of their own kind attempts to stop them before they can reach the Place, and reveal the Thing that was hidden there long ago.

40. A Friend's sibling is an untrained psychic, and has been secretly using his or her powers to protect the Friend from an Enemy. The neural damage has finally overwhelmed their sanity, and they've now kidnapped the Friend to keep them safe. The Enemy is taking this opportunity to make sure the Friend “dies at the hands of their maddened sibling”.

41. A Friend who is a skilled precognitive has just received a flash of an impending atrocity to be committed by an Enemy. He or she needs the party to help them steal the Thing that will prove the Enemy's plans while dodging the assassins sent to eliminate the precog.

42. A Friend who is an exotic dancer is sought by an Enemy who won't take no for an answer. The dancer is secretly a Perimeter agent attempting to infiltrate a Place to destroy maltech research, and plots to use the party to help get him or her into the facility under the pretext of striking at the Enemy.

43. A young woman on an interplanetary tour needs the hire of local bodyguards. She turns out to be a trained and powerful combat psychic, but touchingly naive about local dangers, causing a social Complication that threatens to get the whole group arrested.

44. A librarian Friend has discovered an antique databank with the coordinates of a long-lost pretech cache hidden in a Place sacred to a long-vanished religion. The librarian is totally unsuited for danger, but necessary to decipher the obscure religious iconography needed to unlock the cache. The cache is not the anticipated Thing, but something more dangerous to the finder.

45. A fragment of orbital debris clips a shuttle on the way in, and the spaceport is seriously damaged in the crash. The player's ship or the only vessel capable of getting them off-planet will be destroyed unless the players can organize a response to the dangerous chemical fires and radioactives contaminating the port. A Friend is trapped somewhere in the control tower wreckage.

46. A Friend is allied with a reformist religious group that seeks to break the grip of the current, oppressive hierarchy. The current hierarchs have a great deal of political support with the authorities, but the commoners resent them bitterly. The Friend seeks to secure a remote Place as a meeting-place for the theological rebels.

47. A microscopic black hole punctures an orbital station or starship above the world. Its interaction with the station's artificial grav generators has thrown everything out of whack, and the station's become a minefield of dangerously high or zero grav zones. It's tearing itself apart, and it's going to collapse soon. An Enemy seeks to escape aboard the last lifeboat and to Hell with everyone else. Meanwhile, a Friend is trying to save his engineer daughter from the radioactive, grav-unstable engine rooms.

48. The planet has a sealed alien ruin, and an Enemy-led cult who worships the vanished builders. They're convinced that they have the secret to opening and controlling the power inside the ruins, but they're only halfright. A Friend has found evidence that shows that they'll only devastate the planet if they meddle with the alien power planet. The party has to get inside the ruins and shut down the engines before it's too late. Little do they realize that a few aliens survive inside, in a stasis field that will be broken by the ruin's opening.

49. An Enemy and the group are suddenly trapped in a Place during an accident or Complication. They must work together to escape in time.

50. A telepathic Friend has discovered that an Enemy was responsible for a recent atrocity. Telepathic evidence is useless on this world, however, and if she's discovered to have scanned his mind she'll be lobotomized as a 'rogue psychic'. A Thing might be enough to prove his guilt, if the party can figure out how to get to it without revealing their Friend's meddling.

51. A Friend is responsible for safeguarding a Thing- yet the Thing is suddenly proven to be a fake. The party must find the real object and the Enemy who stole it or else their Friend will be punished as the thief.

52. A Friend is bitten by a poisonous local animal while in a remote Place. The only antidote is back at civilization, yet a Complication threatens to delay the group until it is too late.

53. A lethal plague has started among the residents of the town, but a Complication is keeping aid from reaching them. An Enemy is taking advantage of the panic to hawk a fake cure at ruinous prices, and a Friend is taken in by him. The Complication must be overcome before help can reach the town.

54. A radical political party has started to institute pogroms against “groups hostile to the people”. A Friend is among those groups, and needs to get out of town before an Enemy uses the riot as cover to settle old scores.

55. An Enemy has sold the party an expensive but worthlessly flawed piece of equipment before lighting out for the back country. He and his plunder are holed up at a remote Place.

56. A concert of offworld music is being held in town, and a Friend is slated to be the star performer. Reactionary elements led by an Enemy plot to ruin the “corrupting noise” with sabotage that risks getting performers killed. Meanwhile, a crowd of ignorant offworlder fans have landed and are infuriating the locals.

57. An Enemy is wanted on a neighboring world for some heinous act, and a Friend turns up as a bounty hunter ready to bring him in alive. This world refuses to extradite him, so the capture and retrieval has to evade local law enforcement.
 58. An unanticipated solar storm blocks communications and grounds the poorly-shielded grav vehicle that brought the group to this remote Place. Then people start turning up dead; the storm has awoken a dangerous Enemy beast.

59. A Friend has discovered a partially-complete schematic for an ancient pretech refinery unit that produces vast amounts of something precious on this world- water, oxygen, edible compounds, or the like. Several remote Places on the planet are indicated as having the necessary pretech spare parts required to build the device. When finally assembled, embedded self-modification software in the Thing modifies itself into a pretech combat bot. The salvage from it remains very valuable.

60. A Complication ensnares the party where they are in an annoying but seemingly ordinary event. In actuality, an Enemy is using it as cover to strike at a Friend or Thing that happens to be where the PCs are.

61. A Friend has a cranky, temperamental artificial heart installed, and the doctor who put it in is the only one who really understands how it works. The heart has recently started to stutter, but the doctor has vanished. An Enemy has snatched him to fit his elite assassins with very unsafe combat mods.

62. A local clinic is doing wonders in providing free health care to the poor. In truth, it's a front for an offworld eugenics cult, with useful “specimens” kidnapped and shipped offworld while 'cremated remains' are given to the family. A Friend is snatched by them, but the party knows they'd have never consented to cremation as the clinic staff claim.

63. Space pirates have cut a deal with an isolated backwoods settlement, off loading their plunder to merchants who meet them there. A Friend goes home to family after a long absence, but is kidnapped or killed before they can bring back word of the dealings. Meanwhile, the party is entrusted with a valuable Thing that must be brought to the Friend quickly.

64. A reclusive psychiatrist is offering treatment for violent mentally ill patients at a remote Place. His treatments seem to work, calming the subjects and returning them to rationality, though major memory loss is involved and some severe social clumsiness ensues. In actuality, he's removed large portions of their brains to fit them with remote-control units slaved to an AI in his laboratory. He intends to use them as drones to acquire more “subjects”, and eventual control of the town.

65. Vital medical supplies against an impending plague have been shipped in from offworld, but the spike drive craft that was due to deliver them misjumped, and has arrived in-system as a lifeless wreck transmitting a blind distress signal. Whoever gets there first can hold the whole planet hostage, and an Enemy means to do just that.

66. A Friend has spent a substantial portion of their wealth on an ultra-modern new domicile, and invites the party to enjoy a weekend there. An Enemy has hacked the house's computer system to trap the inhabitants inside and use the automated fittings to kill them.

67. A mud slide, hurricane, earthquake, or other form of disaster strikes a remote settlement. The party is the closest group of responders, and must rescue the locals while dealing with the unearthed, malfunctioning pretech Thing that threatens to cause an even greater calamity if not safely defused.

68. A Friend has found a lost pretech installation, and needs help to loot it. By planetary law, the contents belong to the government.

69. An Enemy mistakes the party for the kind of offworlders who will murder innocents for pay- assuming they aren't that kind, at least. He's sloppy with the contact and unwittingly identifies himself, letting the players know that a Friend will shortly die unless the Enemy is stopped.

70. A party member is identified as a prophesied savior for an oppressed faith or ethnicity. The believers obstinately refuse to believe any protestations to the contrary, and a cynical Enemy in government decides the PC must die simply to prevent the risk of uprising. An equally cynical Friend is determined to push the PC forward as a savior, because that's what's needed.

71. Alien beasts escape from a zoo and run wild through the spectators. The panicked owner offers large rewards for recapturing them live, but some of the beasts are quite dangerous

72. A trained psychic is accused of going feral by an Enemy. The psychic had already suffered severe neural damage before being found for training, so brain scans cannot establish physical signs of madness. The psychic seems unstable, but not violent- at least, on short acquaintance. The psychic offers a psychic PC the secrets of a unique psychic technique if they help him flee.

73. A Thing is the token of rulership on this world, and it's gone missing. If it's not found rapidly, the existing ruler will be deposed. Evidence left at a Place suggests that an Enemy has it, but extralegal means are necessary to investigate fully.

74. Psychics are vanishing, including a Friend. They're being kidnapped by an ostensibly-rogue government researcher who is using them to research the lost psychic disciplines that helped enable pretech manufacturing, and they are being held at a remote Place. The snatcher is a small-time local Enemy with unnaturally ample resources.

75. A Friend desperately seeks to hide evidence of some past crime that will ruin his life should it come to light. An Enemy holds the Thing that proves his involvement, and blackmails him ruthlessly.

76. A courier mistakes the party for the wrong set of offworlders, and wordlessly deposits a Thing with them that implies something awful- med-frozen, child-sized human organs, for example, or a private catalog of gengineered human slaves. The courier's boss shortly realizes the error, and this Enemy tries to silence the PCs while preserving the Place where his evil is enacted.

77. A slowboat system freighter is taken over by Enemy separatist terrorists at the same time as the planet's space defenses are taken offline by internal terrorist attacks. The freighter is aimed straight at the starport, and will crash into it in hours if not stopped.

78. Alien artifacts on the planet's surface start beaming signals into the system's asteroid belt. The signals provoke a social Complication in panicked response, and an Enemy seeks to use the confusion to take over. The actual effect of the signals might be harmless, or might summon a long-lost alien AI warship to scourge life from the world.

79. An alien ambassador Friend is targeted by xenophobe Enemy assassins. Relations are so fragile that if the ambassador even realizes that humans are making a serious effort to kill him, the result may be war.

80. A new religion is being preached by a Friend on this planet. Existing faiths are not amused, and an Enemy among the hierarchy is provoking the people to persecute the new believers, hoping for things to get out of hand.

81. An Enemy was once the patron of a Friend until the latter was betrayed. Now the Friend wants revenge, and they think they have the information necessary to get past the Enemy's defenses.

82. Vital life support or medical equipment has been sabotaged by offworlders or zealots, and must be repaired before time runs out. The only possible source of parts is at a Place, and the saboteurs can be expected to be working hard to get there and destroy them, too.

83. A Friend is importing offworld tech that threatens to completely replace the offerings of an Enemy businessman. The Enemy seeks to sabotage the friend's stock, and thus 'prove' its inferiority.

84. An Exchange diplomat is negotiating for the opening of a branch of the interstellar bank on this world. An Enemy among the local banks wants to show the world as being ungovernably unstable, so provokes Complications and riots around the diplomat.

85. An Enemy is infuriated by the uppity presumption of an ambitious Friend of a lower social caste, and tries to pin a local Complication on the results of his unnatural rejection of his proper place.

86. A Friend is working for an offworld corporation to open a manufactory, and is ignoring local traditions that privilege certain social or ethnic groups, giving jobs to the most qualified workers instead. An angry Enemy seeks to sabotage the factory.

87. An offworld musician who was revered as little less than a god on his homeworld requires bodyguards. He immediately acquires Enemies on this world with his riotous ways, and his guards must keep him from getting arrested if they are to be paid.

88. Atmospheric disturbances, dust storms, or other particulate clouds suddenly blow into town, leaving the settlement blind. An Enemy commits a murder during the darkness, and attempts to frame the players as convenient scapegoats.

89. An Enemy spikes the oxygen supply of an orbital station or unbreathable-atmosphere hab dome with hallucinogens as cover for a theft. Most victims are merely confused and disoriented, but some become violent in their delusions. By chance, the party's air supply was not contaminated.

90. By coincidence, one of the party members is wearing clothing indicative of membership in a violent political group, and thus the party is treated in friendly fashion by a local Enemy for no obvious reason. The Enemy assumes that the party will go along with some vicious crime without complaint, and the group isn't informed of what's in the offing until they're in deep.

91. A local ruler wishes outworlders to advise him of the quality of his execrable poetry- and is the sort to react very poorly to anything less that evidently sincere and fulsome praise. Failure to amuse the ruler results in the party being dumped in a dangerous Place to “experience truly poetic solitude”.

92. A Friend among the locals is unreasonably convinced that offworlder tech can repair anything, and has blithely promised a powerful local Enemy that the party can easily fix a damaged pretech Thing. The Enemy has invested in many expensive spare parts, but the truly necessary pieces are kept in a still-dangerous pretech installation in a remote Place.

93. The party's offworld comm gear picks up a chance transmission from the local government and automatically descrambles the primitive encryption key. The document is proof that an Enemy in government intends to commit an atrocity against a local village with a group of “deniable” renegades in order to steal a Thing kept in the village.

94. A Friend belongs to a persecuted faith, ethnicity, or social class, and appeals for the PCs to help a cell of rebels get offworld before the Enemy law enforcement finds them.

95. A part on the party's ship or the only other transport out has failed, and needs immediate replacement. The only available part is held by an Enemy, who will only willingly relinquish it in exchange for a Thing held by an innocent Friend who will refuse to sell at any price.

96. Eugenics cultists are making gengineered slaves out of genetic material gathered at a local brothel. Some of the unnaturally tempting slaves are being slipped among the prostitutes as bait to infatuate powerful officials, while others are being sold under the table to less scrupulous elites.

97. Evidence has been unearthed at a Place that substantial portions of the planet are actually owned by members of an oppressed and persecuted group. The local courts have no intention of recognizing the rights, but the codes with the ownership evidence would allow someone to bypass a number of antique pretech defenses around the planetary governor's palace. A Friend wants the codes to pass to his friends among the group's rebels.

98. A crop smut threatens the planet's agriculture, promising large-scale famine. A Friend finds evidence that a secret government research station in the system's asteroid belt was conducting experiments in disease-resistant crop strains for the planet before the Silence struck and cut off communication with the station. The existing government considers it a wild goose chase, but the party might choose to help. The station has stasis-frozen samples of the crop sufficient to avert the famine, but it also has less pleasant relics&hellip;.

99. A grasping Enemy in local government seizes the party's ship for some trifling offense. The Enemy wants to end offworld trade, and is trying to scare other traders away. The starship is held within a military cordon, and the Enemy is confident that by the time other elements of the government countermand the order, the free traders will have been spooked off.

100. A seemingly useless trinket purchased by a PC turns out to be the security key to a lost pretech facility. It was sold by accident by a bungling and now-dead minion of a local Enemy, who is hot after the party to “reclaim” his property&hellip; preferably after the party defeats whatever automatic defenses and bots the facility might still support.


# AN EXAMPLE OF ADVENTURE CREATION

> The GM has just started a new campaign, and he needs to brew up an initial adventure to pull the party together and get them accustomed to the sector he's just created. He knows what planet the PCs are going to begin on and he knows he wants them to end up owning a battered free merchant starship by the end of the session, but the rest is still up in the air.
>
> He starts by deciding whether or not to use an adventure seed. While he sees a few that might work, he decides instead to roll up this adventure from scratch.
>
> The world he's created is a planet known to its natives as Delaine, with the world tags “Alien Ruins” and “Xenophobes”. The Delainers have numerous unexplored alien ruins on their world, but fear them as potential sources of catastrophe. They hate outsiders because the offworlders are constantly prodding at the ruins and trying to loot them, and care nothing for the disasters they might unleash on the locals.
>
> The GM knows that his first batch of PCs are very unlikely to all be Delainers, so he decides that they were all passengers on a smuggler ship that tried to land on Delaine and loot one of the ruins. The Delainer defense grid spotted the ship and knocked it down, however, and the PCs were among the few survivors. Maybe the PCs were initially part of the smuggler crew, or maybe they were just oblivious passengers. The GM will let each player decide what their PC's role was during character creation.
>
> The first step is to pick a Problem for the PCs to get involved in. On the face of it, the obvious Problem for the PCs is that they're marooned on a hostile world and need to get off before the natives find them and either kill or imprison them.
>
> The GM wants something a little more specific than this, however. He rolls some dice on the Conflict table, and comes up with “Ethnicity” for the Conflict, with “Two groups that hate each other” and “Official ethnic ghettos”. Given Delaine's history, the GM decides that any non-native Delainers present when the world shut down its contact with other planets were separated out into remote ethnic reservations, far away from the ruins. These “offworlders” have been here for generations but are despised by the native Delainers.
>
> With that established, the GM decides that the PC's ship was shot down near one of these reservations, and the bitter offworlders are interested in helping people whom the Delainers hate. But who will the initial Person the PCs contact be?
>
> The dice paint the picture of an offworlder motivated to redeem themselves from a prior failure, who wants to find proof of a rival NPC's malfeasance, who knows where significant wealth is to be found, and wears a particularly odd style of dress. From this, the GM creates “the Captain”, a former ruin smuggler whose crew was gunned down while trying to loot an alien ruin. Only he survived, and his guilt is intense. He still wears a nautical captain's hat, and is hiding out among the offworlders. He knows where he's hidden his ship and can guide the PCs to it if they can make the dangerous overland journey.
>
> The GM isn't so certain about the Captain's want, however. While something like that would make a good sideline for a longer adventure, he wants this initial adventuring session to be relatively short and straightforward. He replaces the want with the Captain's desire for the PCs to get him and his young offworlder wife off the planet, bringing them to just about any place that isn't on Delaine. He's willing to give the PCs his ship if they just help him get away.
>
> Why hasn't the Captain snuck off with his young bride yet? To answer that question, the GM turns to the Places section and rolls up a hazard. The result is “Sentient”, which means that there's an intelligent enemy between the Captain and the ship. The GM mulls over the possibilities for a while, and decides the Captain wasn't the only survivor. His first mate made it out too, and blames the Captain. He's gathered together a small band of offworlder rebels and is seeking to loot ruins and harm Delainers, because he can't operate the ship without the Captain's security codes and he's not sufficiently talented to hack the locks himself.
>
> At this point, the GM looks at the adventure and identifies the bits he needs to flesh out. He needs to detail the Captain, the first mate, the offworlder rebels, and the Delainer security chief who will seek to apprehend the PCs if they're not sufficiently stealthy. All of these people will need combat stats. The Captain's wife, the offworlder reservation locals, and other bit NPCs are unlikely to get into a fight, and don't need stats.
>
> The GM decides he doesn't need a map for the offworlder reservation settlement, but he does need a map of the terrain between the settlement and the hidden ship. He downloads a suitable terrain map from the web for that. On the map, he plants a few Wilderness Ongoings from the Places table that the PCs may or may not encounter depending on how they chart their course.
>
> The last detail to flesh out is the first mate's rebel camp, and how the PCs might get at the starship they're guarding. The GM decides that it's not reasonable for the first mate to have accumulated a vast number of minions, but there are too many for the PCs to comfortably engage. The PCs will have to think of some way to distract them, or possibly sic the Delainer security chief on them before they can get to the ship. It's not the GM's job to hand them a solution, so they'll have to puzzle it out on their own.
>
> With that done, the starting adventure is ready. The GM might add some more details and fluff, but what he has is a playable start to a campaign.

# XENOBESTIARY

A band of interstellar adventurers can expect to encounter a wide range of creatures in the course of their travels. Whether the hungry fauna of an uncharted planet or the trigger-happy gunmen of an alien organ smuggler, a GM needs to have the relevant statistics at hand to manage probable hostilities.

# Handling Potential Combat

Before picking foes from this chapter, however, a GM should make sure that the enemies chosen and the perils generated are appropriate for the situation. This does *not* mean that the enemies have to be an “appropriate” combat challenge for the PC group, one that they have a reasonable chance of defeating. It means that they should be appropriate to the location and role they fill in the setting.

If there's a stretch of wilderness adjacent to a human community, a party-eating hellbeast should not be lairing there without some notice by the locals. If such an unstoppable horror does exist secretly in the wilderness, the fact that it is hidden should be somehow explained or meaningful. NPCs notice hazards next door, and PCs who pay attention should hear about that danger before they end up walking into its cave.

In the same vein, if the PCs run into a bunch of street thugs, the hooligans should not be exhibiting Spartan discipline and crack military expertise unless the PCs have gone slumming on a planet of genetic super-soldiers. The goons might actually not be much of a combat threat at all, and dangerous only for the potential grudges the PCs could earn in executing them.

Lastly, don't add combat encounters that are unavoidable. There are very few realistic situations where the only possible result is a gun battle. A group of trigger-happy mercs might happen to be sitting directly on top of the party's objective, but if there's no way to lure them away or sneak past them&ndash; or worse, if you're not prepared to allow the PCs to *try* to lure them away or sneak past them&ndash; then the players will learn not to try to solve problems with anything but a hot gun barrel.

Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** is dangerous. Every squeeze of a trigger risks killing a novice adventurer, and even a veteran of countless heroic deeds can get mowed down in a hurry by a half-dozen goons with mag rifles. If your adventures funnel the PCs into near-unavoidable firefights or saber-toothed alien monsters, the PCs are going to suffer casualties. A certain degree of death can add spice and excitement to a game and help make player choices feel more meaningful, but inevitable gory disembowelment in the third inescapable pirate brawl of the day is just tedious.

# The Reaction Roll

One of the GM's most important tools for managing encounters with NPCs is the ***reaction roll***. Whenever the PCs first meet with a creature or NPC, the GM should roll 2d6 and consult the following table.


### Table - Reactions

| 2d6  | Reaction | Result                                 |
|:----:| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
|  2   | Hostile  | reacting as negatively as is plausible |
| 3-5  | Negative | unfriendly and unhelpful               |
| 6-8  | Neutral  | reacting predictably or warily         |
| 9-11 | Positive | potentially cooperative with PCs       |
|  12  | Friendly | helpful as is plausible to be          |



The result should be taken in context. If the PCs just happen to run into a pack of hab-complex gangers, a positive result might simply mean the gangers think it's a bad idea to interfere with the PCs. That same result when meeting a bored starport bureaucrat might mean she's feeling magnanimous, and is willing to help the PCs accomplish their purpose. In general, low results make the situation more hostile than the predictable baseline, while high results make the NPC more friendly or cooperative than they might normally be under the circumstances.

Reaction rolls are important because they help a GM adjudicate a situation in a potentially surprising or interesting way. If the PCs are crossing a radioactive badland crawling with violent scavenger tribes, the GM might just reflexively assume that every scavenger band they encounter is immediately going to reach for their scrap-guns. A reaction roll is a cue for the GM to pause and think, and a friendly result can open up a situation with far more potential novelty than the sixth consecutive gun battle. Conversely, even if everything seems to suggest an NPC should be helpful and friendly toward the PCs, a negative result can get the GM thinking about potential reasons *why* the NPC is so hostile towards supposedly allied PCs.

An NPC or a group's initial reaction is not the last word, of course. A silver-tongued PC might be able to talk them out of hostility or induce them to do the party a favor, and more pragmatic offers of money, favors, or incipient violence might also sway their attitudes. Such manipulation happens after the initial attitude is determined, however, and what exactly the PCs offer or threaten will usually depend on how the NPC is initially reacting to them.

# HUMANITY

Humans are likely to form the great majority of the NPCs that the heroes encounter, whether as patrons, companions, or the targets of their guns. In many cases a GM won't need to bother with combat statistics for an NPC. They might be so unmartial that they can present no serious threat to a party of hardened freebooters, or so distant that there's no real chance that they'll become engaged in combat.

In others, however, it's necessary to decide how much a particular NPC is worth in a fight.

The example human opponents here assume normal baseline humanity. Those who have received extensive cyberware, gengineering, psychic augmentation, or other exotic treatments may have abilities far in excess of their normal brethren, including unique powers and special abilities.

# Degrees of Danger

Most human NPCs on advanced, civilized planets are of almost no use in combat. By societal training and personal inclination, they are almost incapable of responding to lethal threats with a quick, decisive reaction. Citizens of less peaceful societies, where violence is a commonplace, will have more useful reactions to such hostilities. Men and women who have been hardened to combat by experience or training will also respond more effectively.

The combat statistics provided here cover the usual range of human martial talent. At the bottom are those soft citizens of peaceful worlds and at the top are those engines of mortal ruin who are the most dangerous men and women in the sector. Even more heroic appetites for slaughter can be found in those who have been altered by genetic engineering or advanced technical modifications, but such paragons of pain are special cases to be judged by the GM accordingly.

When assigning combat statistics to NPC, it's important not to be influenced by the personal prowess of the PCs. If country estate is protected by ordinary security guards, then the guards should *be* ordinary security guards, whether or not the party could reasonably hope to defeat a dozen such protectors in open combat. The universe does not scale to the PCs. If a party of untested novices finds themselves facing a squad of elite killers, they should *run*. If those famously lethal killers encounter the PCs six levels later, their fame might get abbreviated in a hurry by the PCs' grim new expertise.

This even-handedness is important in creating a plausible, functional world for the players to operate in. If they know that challenges will be scaled up or down to give them a “fair fight” then it hardly matters what challenges they choose to face. Planning to carefully avoid excess dangers and betting on overcoming more reasonable threats makes their choices meaningful in your game world, and encourages the players to engage carefully with the setting.

# Using the Table

The table provided in this section gives you benchmarks for some basic NPC types and then a selection of specific examples. When you're creating your own NPCs, you can use the benchmarks to get an idea of where they should be, and the specific examples can be pulled during play when you're in need of quick opponents to stock your adventures.

The table provides simplified combat statistics. NPCs don't normally have foci, specific skill levels, attribute scores, or any of the other details that add complexity to PCs. Nor do they have classes or class abilities. Instead, simpler totals and summaries are used to account for these other factors. You can give NPCs class powers and foci if you wish, or even create an NPC as if they were a full-fledged PC, but that kind of detail and work is more than most NPCs are worth.

***HD*** is the NPC's ***hit dice***. The overwhelming majority of NPCs have only one hit die. Only men and women with a history of surviving violence and dealing with mortal peril should have more than one hit die. Just because an NPC is “important” doesn't mean they have more hit dice. The CEO of an interstellar megacorp probably has one hit die, as does the president of the planetary government. Conversely, the grizzled warrior-king of a lostworlder monarchy or a poison-wary bishop of a church where promotion is through mortality might have half a dozen hit dice. The most danger-hardened legends of a sector should have about ten hit dice, or more if they've been somehow altered by gengineering or advanced technology. An NPC's [hit points](#^character-hit-points) are rolled at 1d8 for each hit die. ^npc-hit-dice

***AC*** is the NPC's usual Armor Class. This will vary with the armor they're wearing, and some NPCs might have an included +1 or +2 bonus if they're especially dexterous, but the listed score reflects the armor they usually have on. By default, this is street armor that is not obvious to casual inspection. Some entries are marked “primitive”, meaning that their armor is ignored by advanced weapons, while others are marked “combat”, meaning that they wear very obviously protective armor. Such NPCs might need to wear less obvious gear in some social situations. A few of them are marked “powered”, meaning that the NPC normally has access to some kind of advanced power armor that renders them immune to primitive weapons. When creating your own NPCs, give them the armor that is appropriate to their role and situation. ^npc-armor-class

***Atk*** is the NPC's attack bonus. For the sake of simplicity, this includes any attribute modifiers, skill bonus, or other extra lethality that the NPC might have earned. For most NPCs, their attack bonus is equal to their hit dice. Martial NPCs might have an additional bonus on top of that, or even attack twice with each Main Action. ^npc-attack-bonus

***Dmg*** is the damage the NPC inflicts in combat. For human combatants, this depends on the weapon they're using, with most ordinary men and women carrying no real weapon. Very capable warriors might do additional damage on top of the weapon's roll, from +1 to +4 points. ^npc-damage

### Table - Common NPCs

| General NPC Type     | HD  |       AC       |   Atk   |     Dmg      | Move | ML  | Skills | Saves |
| -------------------- |:---:|:--------------:|:-------:|:------------:| ----:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|

***Move*** is the distance the NPC travels when they take a Move action in combat. For humans, this is ten meters, though gengineered or other boosted subjects might be able to move faster than this. ^npc-move

***ML*** is the NPC's Morale score, their likelihood of retreating when in danger. When an NPC faces unusual peril, they need to make a Morale check on 2d6. If they roll equal or less than their Morale score, they withstand the danger and continue fighting. If they roll more than their Morale, they break. Poorly-trained combatants will simply run for their lives or beg for mercy, while more hardened ones will make a fighting withdrawal to a place of safety. PCs never need to make Morale checks. ^npc-morale

Most groups will need to make a Morale check the first time one of their members is killed or disabled, and the first time it looks like they're losing the fight. If they succeed in both checks, they'll continue fighting as long as it doesn't seem hopeless. NPCs with no martial aptitude at all must also make a Morale check when lethal combat begins; on a failure, they're too shocked, frightened, or disbelieving to do anything useful, and will stand frozen, run in terror, or try to ignore what's obviously happening around them.

***Skills*** summarizes the NPC's general aptitude at skill checks related to their profession or role. When the NPC needs to make a skill check or compete in an opposed skill check, they may add this skill bonus to their roll if the test relates to role. If the activity has nothing especially to do with what the NPC would be good at, they cannot add this bonus, and just roll the skill check unmodified. Most NPCs will have this at +1, while skilled professionals will have it at +2, and exceptionally gifted and expert NPCs will have it at +3 or +4. Sector-wide legends will have it at +5. ^npc-skills

***Saves*** are the single saving throw score that all NPCs use whenever they need to make a saving throw. Whether Mental Physical, or Evasion, the NPC rolls against this single target. Most NPCs have a save score of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down. ^npc-saves

# Psychics and Special Traits

> When building NPCs with psychic powers or other special abilities, it's usually not worth the effort of rolling them up like PCs. Just assign them a few abilities you think will matter during the game and give them a third of their hit dice in maximum Effort, rounded up.
>
> In the same vein, gengineered humans or rare virtuosos might have abilities akin to Foci or unique powers. Just assign them as fits the situation, and don't worry about making them like PCs.

# Robots and VIs

The prevalence of robots varies between sectors. Some positively teem with sentient VIs programmed for various purposes, while others have hardly any robotics at all beyond industrial automation. The creation of particularly sophisticated bots, especially sentient-seeming VIs, is critically influenced by the local metadimensional energy environment. With an unfriendly higher-order energy shadow, the intricate quantum flux of VI “brains” cannot function properly. True AIs are immune to such vagaries, but True AIs are almost impossible to create in bulk, even for the lost industries of the Terran Mandate.

# Expert Systems and VIs

In the vast majority of sectors, robots are operated by expert systems programmed to carry out a specific kind of work. These expert systems may feign human intelligence, but they are non-sentient and incapable of dealing with environments and situations outside their normal operational scope. The more sophisticated and expensive the expert system, the more flexible it is about handling events within its purview.

In some sectors, however, the local environment is suitable for the creation of extremely sophisticated expert systems bolstered by quantum neural nets. It is a constant point of debate over whether the resultant “Virtual Intelligences” are truly self-aware or simply give a perfect impression of such. Some sectors hold the former, and grant VI full human rights, forbidding their makers from implanting behavioral imperatives. Most sectors believe the latter, using VIs as a labor force programmed to deeply enjoy their utilitarian function. VIs in such sectors can be bought, sold, and mistreated much as any other piece of property.

While VIs have or can mimic human-level intelligence, they can also be programmed with behavioral imperatives or curbs, giving them a deep urge to perform a certain kind of work or an unbreakable inability to carry out certain kinds of acts. Most service VIs are programmed with imperatives to love their work and be thoroughly happy in carrying it out, as well as with curbs against harming human beings or allowing themselves to be damaged. These impulses are overwhelming, but not especially nuanced; the more specific and complex the programmed psychological limit, the more prone it is to failure or misguidance.

VIs are not True AIs. They do not have a quantum identity core and they are inexorably tied into the specific hardware and chassis they were created to operate. While mods and adjustments can be made to this “birth body”, the VI cannot be transplanted into a new chassis, nor can they survive the destruction of their body.

VIs are much more difficult to produce than non-sentient expert systems. The quantum growth process is much more reliable and tractable than that used to create a True AI, but it still fails annoyingly often. As a consequence, even sectors where the environment allows the creation of VIs often prefer to use simple, cheap, reliably-replicable “dumb” expert systems for mundane tasks.

# Expert System Bots

The robots listed in the adjacent table are standard-issue expert system bots, each one equipped with a level 1 expert system. Each expert system is programmed to handle a particular role: security, tour guidance, industrial labor, household cleaning, personal companionship, child care, or some other general field. The most basic programming and cognitive hardware counts as a “level 1” system. More sophisticated work allows for level 2 programming, up to level 4 as the maximum for most TL4 sectors.

Each level of expert system beyond the first comes with upgrades to the robot's durability, danger management, and exception handling skills. They also add to the robot's base cost; a level 2 expert system doubles a robot's base cost, for example. The table below gives the various expert system levels, the hit die and saving throw bonus granted by each, the attack bonus a given level adds, and the skill check modifier to be applied to checks related to the bot's intended function.

### Table - Expert System Upgrades

| Level |   HD | Atk. | Skill |    Save | Cost |
|:-----:| ----:| ----:| -----:| -------:| ----:|
|   1   | Base | Base |  Base |    Base | Base |
|   2   |   +1 |   +1 |    +1 | 1 lower |   x2 |
|   3   |   +2 |   +2 |    +1 | 1 lower |   x4 |
|   4   |   +4 |   +4 |    +2 | 2 lower |   x8 |


Whenever the bot is put in a position not covered by its programming, it needs to make a confusion check. The GM rolls 2d6, adding its skill bonus, against a difficulty based on the strangeness of the situation. A situation partly within its usual compass might be difficulty 7, while a completely uncovered event would be difficulty 9, and a situation that is both completely uncovered and clearly dangerous would be 11. On a success, the expert system does something reasonable and in line with its function. On a failure, the expert system does what it's normally meant to do in an inappropriate way or direction.

Damaged bots can be repaired by someone with at least Fix-0 skill and a postech toolkit. One unit of spare parts and fifteen minutes of work can repair a number of lost [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points) equal to the bot's expert system level. Expert system bots reduced to zero [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points) are destroyed and cannot be salvaged.

Expert system bots do have “morale” of a kind; when destruction seems imminent, most are programmed to retreat. This can be overridden by owners.

# Virtual Intelligences

In sectors where VIs can still be manufactured, the price is equivalent to ten times the cost of an equivalent expert system bot. Thus, a stock companion bot upgraded with VI programming would cost 25,000 credits. To give a top-of-theline heavy warbot with a level 4 expert system VI wiring would leave the bot costing a tremendous four million credits.

VI wiring does not integrate well with conventional expert system programming. The same static procedures and protocols that can make a level 4 expert system so good at its specific task are difficult for a human-like VI intellect to process, and it requires intensive and expensive cognitive reinforcement to allow the VI to take advantage of these resources. As a consequence, it is very rare for VIs to be implanted in high-end expert system bots.

Most VIs do not develop additional skills or competencies, nor do they exhibit personal growth or changes in personality. They are the way they have been programmed, even if inhibitor curbs and behavioral imperatives are absent.

Some VIs, however, are different. For whatever inexplicable reason, these VIs are capable of learning and growing as human beings are. They lack the potential for godlike intelligence possessed by True AIs and they cannot make effective use of supplementary cognitive resources as True AIs can, but over time and with experience, these VIs can become as skilled and capable as any human.

Such “clever” VIs are an annoyance in sectors where VI bots are common. Buyers don't want their receptionist bots to suddenly decide they'd rather be poets, and while behavioral imperatives and inhibitor curbs still have an effect on clever VIs, some of these bots can “out-think” their limits and sidestep these blocks. Some worlds allow clever VIs to exist as free citizens, while others consider them public nuisances to be scrapped if they wander off from their owners.

VI bots are more durable than their ordinary cousins. If reduced to zero [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points) by trauma less than a hit with a Heavy weapon or similar complete ruin, they can be repaired with 24 hours of work by one tech with Fix-0. Jury-rigging a downed VI back into operation is much faster, allowing them to “heal” with spare parts as if they were an ordinary bot. If reduced to zero HP again before a 24-hour overhaul, however, they perish.

### Types of Bots

While a wide range of bots are available on the market in most sectors, the selection given here cover most of the robots likely to be encountered by PCs. Most civilian bots are programmed to avoid harming humans, but such programming can be overridden by sufficiently determined owners.

***Janitor bots*** are ubiquitous, cheap and reliable droids that can clean up detritus and keep an office, street, or private home tidy. Their small size and limited array of tools make them useless in a fight save as targets or convenient explosives carriers. ^robot-types-janitor-bots

***Civilian security bots*** are sometimes found guarding locations. They're not smart enough to handle complex human interactions, but their tireless determination is convenient when guarding a place that few humans are expected to enter. Most models use a stunning touch that non-lethally disables targets, while less gentle bots are equipped with guns or melee weapons. ^robot-types-civilian-security-bots
 ***Repair bots*** and ***industrial work bots*** are found at work sites and in starships or other complex technical edifices. Expert system repair bots are extremely efficient about dealing with standard failures and damage, but they can “panic” when faced with crises beyond their usual operating parameters. Industrial work bots are slow, tough, heavy machines most often used for lifting and manipulating heavy objects in need of laser welding or other shaping. ^robot-types-repair-bots

***Companion bots*** range from nannybots and petbots to specially-designed “companions” for other purposes. The latter are strictly regulated on many worlds, either to encourage reproduction, to quash their use for reprehensible urges, or out of perceived fears of societal decay and decadence. ^robot-types-companion-bots

***Soldier bots*** are designed on humanoid lines so as to easily use standard human vehicles and equipment. The chaotic and confusing nature of warfare leaves most soldier bots of somewhat limited utility without a human bot wrangler to direct them, but when a wave attack is needed, a simple self-preservation toggle can be flipped off and the iron horde can be aimed at a foe. ^robot-types-soldier-bots

***Heavy warbots*** are ogreish engines of war with integral plasma guns and the ability to attack twice with each Main Action. In addition, most are capable of mounting a Heavy weapon which may be fired in lieu of the plasma guns. They're most often used as mobile heavy weapons platforms for squads in the field. ^robot-types-heavy-warbots

### Robots In Your Campaign

A GM is not obligated to include VIs or ubiquitous robotics in her campaign. Adding these elements can have a significant effect on a setting, and sometimes they can prove to be a distraction from the sort of play that the group wants to have. A GM is always well within her rights to simply decide that the sector lacks the necessary metadimensional environment for VI production and is short on many of the critical minerals for producing expert system bots. Outside of industrial assembly lines and mindless extraction work, labor is performed by humans.

Sometimes, however, a GM will want to include VIs in her sector, either because she's emulating a genre where intelligent robots are a commonplace, or because a particular player wants to play a PC VI, or because she simply likes them.

If a GM does decide to add VIs to her setting, she'll need to decide how common they are and how most of the worlds in the sector treat them. The simplest way to do this is to gently gloss over the economic and social impact of VIs. The world operates much as it does today, with humans doing most of the work and VIs serving only occasional functions as showpieces of the wealthy or off-stage laborers in industry. They are programmed to love their work, they're “happy” in a robotic sense, and the various worlds of the sector give little consideration to wider issues of VI rights or the morality of programmed VI behavioral imperatives.

Other GMs will want to increase the impact of VIs on particular worlds. Perhaps some of them have largely replaced their low-skilled members with VI laborers, and the replaced humans are either frustrated and angry or kept pacified by robotic dole payments. Other worlds might dispute the lack of rights that most VIs have, insisting that a VI ought not to be programmed with behavioral imperatives at “birth”, but be allowed to choose its own functionality. Of course, it might be that almost no one would bother to build them in that case, but such crusaders might believe it better that a VI never be “born” than that it be created in servitude. In brief, the GM can pick some aspect of VI existence and use the conflicts inherent in it to spice up the sector.

Expert system bots are less disruptive to a campaign because they come with less moral baggage that a society has to deal with. It's easy for a GM to simply decide that most expert system bots are only smart enough for simple industrial tasks or menial labor, and that the impact they have on the local economy doesn't necessarily force it into some strange futuristic pattern. There are still poor janitors, grouchy middle-aged security guards, and cynical street-corner prostitutes in an age of robotic labor.

Some PC groups will be very keen to buy robots of their own, the better to help in their adventures. So long as you keep an expert system's limitations in mind, this shouldn't be disruptive, and it would make an excellent sink for a party's excess money.

### VI Player Characters

In campaigns where the GM allows it, a player can choose to make a VI as a player character. They do this by spending their free focus pick on one of the origins listed below. These origin foci have only one level, and normally can only be taken during character creation. In exceptional cases, a human PC transformed into a full-conversion cyborg might be allowed to take it later.

### Special VI Rules

All VI PCs have the same attributes, [hit points](#^character-hit-points), abilities, and character classes as humans do, but normal VIs cannot be Psychics nor take the Partial Psychic class option for Adventurers. They are created the same way as any other human PC and start out at first level. While they may have been built to be a particular type of bot, they use their own statistics, and not those for their type here. VIs that are not wearing armor normally have Armor Class 10, just as humans do.

VIs need neither sleep, eat, nor drink, requiring one Type B cell per week of operation away from readily-available current. They are immune to vacuum but suffer degradation from radiation as humans do. They cannot be poisoned or diseased by normal forms of toxin. They can be reprogrammed, altering or erasing their personality and behavioral limits, but such mental remodeling takes at least an undisturbed month to execute by someone with at least Program-1 skill. Most VIs will fight to their destruction to avoid such a fate.

VIs can be healed with spare parts and the work of someone with Fix-0 skill. VIs can always repair themselves, even without the requisite skill. Each unit of spare parts heals lost [hit points](#^character-hit-points) equal to the VI's character level and takes fifteen minutes to apply. VIs cannot normally be affected by biopsionic healing effects.

VIs reduced to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) but not entirely smashed are incapacitated and Badly Damaged. Removing this quality requires 24 hours of work by a technician and at least one unit of spare parts, after which damage can be repaired as normal. As a field expedient, a tech can jury-rig a Badly Damaged VI in the field, healing it with spare parts at the normal rate and speed. If such a bot is reduced to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points) again while Badly Damaged, however, it must make a Physical save or be permanently destroyed.

VIs are intimately connected to their specific hardware, and cannot be transplanted into new forms. Cosmetic alterations can be made, however, and equipment can be grafted into the VI's chassis. Such built-in equipment costs twice as much as a standalone component and takes a week to properly integrate into the VI's system. A VI can have a total number of encumbrance points worth of additional gear grafted onto it equal to half its Constitution score, rounded down. Such gear may require its own separate power source or ammunition supply. VIs cannot make use of cyberware.

### Android

You were built as an android, a robot indistinguishable from a human without a medical-grade inspection. Most androids are “companion” bots, though other VIs with roles that involve significant human interaction may also be built as androids. Minor scuffs and cuts don't reveal your robotic nature, but if reduced to zero [hit points](#^character-hit-points), your unnatural innards are obvious.

***Level 1:*** Gain a bonus skill related to your intended function. You have all the usual traits and abilities of a VI robot.

### VI Worker Bot

You were built for industrial or technical labor, where a human face was an unnecessary luxury. Most such VI bots are humanoid, if only to more conveniently manipulate human-scale devices, but their inhuman nature is obvious.

***Level 1:*** Gain a bonus skill related to your intended function. Choose an attribute associated with your work and gain a +1 bonus to its modifier, up to a maximum of +2. You have all the usual traits and abilities of a VI robot.

### VI Vehicle Bot

Some VIs were instantiated in actual vehicles rather than conventional humanoid bodies. Most were purely synthetic in origins, but some sectors retain the techniques for brain transplants into non-human bodies. Some polities have been known to conduct full-body cyberneticization of soldiers into tanks, warships, attack helicopters, and other military vehicles. As a vehicle, you are usually equipped with manipulator arms that can be used on adjacent objects. You may operate the individual elements of your vehicle as if they were your own limbs, attacking once per round with a mounted weapon of your choice.

***Level 1:*** Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. Pick a vehicle acceptable to the GM, usually a drone, hoverbike or gravcar. You become that vehicle. You retain your usual attributes but gain the vehicle's Armor score. You are Armor Class 10, modified by your Dexterity score. A tech can improve your Armor Class by aftermarket modifications, adding up to three times their Fix skill to your Armor Class at a cost of 1,000 credits per point of improvement.

You use the vehicle's [hit points](#^vehicle-hit-points) until your own normally-rolled hit point score exceeds that number. Many VI vehicles purchase a drone or humanoid robot body to carry on board and employ for remote operation in areas unsuitable for a vehicle; you can pilot a single surrogate body in lieu of your own Main Action, provided there's no ECM to jam the control transmissions.

# Beasts

Most alien beasts are simply flavor for a world, odd creatures to decorate the background and provide some light interest for the players. Sometimes, however, a GM needs a genuinely dangerous beast, either to occupy some perilous wilderness or to threaten the PCs and their allies.

When creating a beast, work from your needs. Build the creature with the statistics and role that you need for your adventure, and then decorate those basic statistics with the creature's appearance, special hazards, and behavior.

### Creating Beasts

To build an alien beast, it's easiest to start with some Terran referent. A completely alien and exotic creature with no relation to any earthly life form tends to be very difficult to explain to players and it can be awkward for the GM to guess its normal behavior.

The tables on the opposite page provide some basic suggestions for styling the essential animal features of the beast. Start with the “Basic Animal Features” to get the creature's general theme, and then move on to identify its body plan. You might then add on some novelty to its limbs or skin, decide the main weapon it uses to hunt prey or defend itself, and choose a general size for the animal.

The basic animal features serve only as a starting point for your creativity. The creature might have a mammalian general plan, but you could then decide that its “fur” is a stiff, glassy mineral exudate that slashes anything that bites or strikes it. It can be helpful to stick to one basic animal type for a given alien world, with all the creatures the PCs encounter sharing similar broad features or common traits.

While a fully-developed ecosphere might include countless different evolutionary strategies, sticking to just one or two in play helps characterize a world and give a sense of consistency to its fauna. If all the dangerous creatures of Scutum have thick moss-colored armor plating, then the PCs will be able to guess that a strange creature with thick moss-colored armor plating is probably an import from Scutum.

### Swarms

Sometimes a beast is only meaningfully dangerous in vast packs, like a swarm of ants or a squealing tide of ravenous rats. Other times beasts are found most often in huge herds rather than as lone individuals.

To create such a swarm, take the basic animal type and quadruple its hit dice. For tiny creatures that have only 1 hit point, give the swarm 4 hit dice. The swarm gets its usual attack against anyone in contact with it, but on a miss, it still does the minimum possible damage to the target unless the victim is immune to its attacks. Thus, a rat swarm that has a +1 attack bonus and does 1d2 damage on a hit would roll that attack against every PC caught in the swarm. On a hit, they would do 1d2 damage, and a miss would still do 1 point.

Any attack against the swarm automatically hits, assuming the weapon is useful. Firing a pistol into a creeping carpet of ants is singularly useless, but waving a flaming torch in front of rats or throwing a grenade into the swarm might help dispatch the pack.

### Beast Behavior

Many alien creatures will have no inherited aversion to humans, and will not fear them. Predators will hunt them if they look like food and prey will ignore them if they don't look like predators.

In combat, predators will only fight to the death if maddened or cornered. Sane predators cannot afford to get hurt while hunting. In addition to the usual times for Morale checks, beasts must make an additional check the first time their “prey” harms the predator.

### Importing Creatures

Aside from the beasts you can create with these charts, an endless supply of fantasy monsters and exotic creatures await lifting from other old-school games. Almost any of the “monsters” found in traditional old-school role-playing games can be imported almost unchanged into ***Stars Without Number***, requiring little more than an attack bonus and Armor Class conversion. Reskin them to fit your needs, and voila; you have your beast.

### Styling the Beast

You can use these tables to assemble a general look for your beast. First, roll on the basic animal features table to get a general “theme” for the creature. If you ever need inspiration for particular details about the creature, just refer back to its basic theme.

Next, roll on the tables below to get additional inspiration. Note that you don't have to roll on any particular one. Instead, just use them to fill in the blanks and spark your own creativity, editing things when necessary to fit the creature's intended role.

|  8  | Mindlessly attacks humans         | Breeds at tremendous rates         | Steals prey from weaker predator   |


### Table - Harmful Discharges

| d8  | Harmful Discharges                         |
|:---:| ------------------------------------------ |
|  1  | Acidic spew doing its damage on a hit      |
|  2  | Toxic spittle or cloud, use adjacent chart |
|  3  | Super-heated or super-chilled spew         |
|  4  | Sonic drill or other disabling noise       |
|  5  | Natural laser or plasma discharge          |
|  6  | Nauseating stench or disabling chemical    |
|  7  | Equipment-melting corrosive                |
|  8  | Explosive pellets or chemical catalysts    |


Harmful discharges usually use a normal attack roll and inflict the typical damage on a hit. At your discretion, some discharges may have additional effects, such as poison, gear destruction, ongoing acidic damage, or an explosive area of effect. Appropriate Physical or Evasion saving throws might be called for to avoid the worst of such perils.

### Table - Poisons

| d6  | Poison                     | Onset       | Duration   |
|:---:| -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
|  1  | Death                      | Instant     | 1d6 rounds |
|  2  | Paralysis                  | 1 round     | 1 minute   |
|  3  | 1d4 dmg per onset interval | 1d6 rounds  | 10 minutes |
|  4  | Convulsions                | 1 minute    | 1 hour     |
|  5  | Blindness                  | 1d6 minutes | 1d6 hours  |
|  6  | Hallucinations             | 1 hour      | 1d6 days   |


You can roll three times on the table above to generate a poison for a creature, or pick to suit your needs. Most effects incapacitate a victim, though blindness or ongoing damage may not wholly disable a PC.

PCs can usually attempt a Physical save to resist a poison. Toxins can be treated with a medkit or antidote stim. If the medic lacks the specific antidote to a poison, they can make an Int/Heal skill check to try to halt it. The difficulty is usually 9, with one check allowed.

# Aliens

Exotic alien races are a staple of science fiction, and most GMs running ***Stars Without Number*** are going to want a few types of sapients to round out a sector. Some GMs might prefer to run a strictly human game, leaving humanity alone in this particular corner of the cosmos, but other GMs will want to have the details of a few alien races in hand, if only to help envision the kind of artifacts and ruins that they might have left behind. This section will discuss the role of aliens in a game and a process for creating your own alien races.

### The Use of Aliens in the Game

When adding an alien race to your sector, it's necessary to keep in mind the ultimate purpose you have for including them. A given species might be fascinating to you, but if they don't actually help to accomplish something for your game it's likely that the players will simply gloss over their existence. By having a concrete purpose in mind for a race you can ensure that the players have a useful reason to interact with them.

Aliens are useful as antagonists. The classic “bugeyed monster” trope has survived for a reason; unthinkingly hostile and uncommunicative beings make great fodder for brute physical struggle. Making these monsters part of a sapient, tool-using species allows them to scale upward in threat the way no beast can, and continue to imperil even an experienced, well-equipped band of adventurers.

Antagonism can take more forms than simple combativeness. Aliens can want things, and want them for reasons that would make no sense at all to a human. Biological imperatives, exotic religions, alien philosophies, and customs born on completely un-Earth-like worlds can all justify goals and purposes that would be entirely irrational for a human being. Humans might find themselves at cross purposes with these aliens without ever fully understanding why the beings are pursuing a given goal.

From a GM's perspective, this is a wonderful trait for building adventures. If you need aliens to pursue some goal, however bizarre, you can simply add a trait to them that makes that goal important. For example, if you need aliens to be obsessed with wiping out the humans on a given planet, you can simply decide that the planet is their ancestral homeworld, to which they must return every thousand years in order to perform a great spawning rite. The presence of the humans there defiles the world, and the aliens grow increasingly frantic as the time for the rite approaches.

Aliens also make excellent patrons for many of the same reasons that they make good antagonists. You can give them a good reason to want almost anything, and players are unlikely to balk at it as unlikely or implausible. If you need to give the players a reason to go somewhere, do something, or find something, you can use aliens to drive the process. The matter might be so important to the aliens that they find themselves willing to employ human agents to accomplish their ends, or it may be that only humans have the numbers and strength to help them.

Aliens are occasions for exploration and discovery. While this may not have the immediate adventure utility of an antagonist or a patron, one of the things about sandbox gaming that appeals to many players is the opportunity to go out and discover new things. The universe is full of bizarre and exotic beings, and there can be a lot of enjoyment in learning about their cultures and traits. Most players aren't interested in a full-dress anthropological study of an alien race, but there is an excitement in visiting uncharted worlds and meeting strange and wondrous beings.

In some cases, this exploration doesn't even need live aliens. The universe is laden with numerous ancient alien ruins, and players can get a good conception of a long-lost race simply from examining what they've left behind. A GM with a firm grasp on a species' psychology and physiology has much of what he needs to create their abandoned cities and outposts and to stock them with art, artifacts, and remnants for the enticement of exploring PCs.

Humanoid species make the most widely useful aliens, and most of the species you create should probably be of that variety. Aliens that are too hard to understand tend to be more animate plot devices, operating by utterly incomprehensible rules and motivations. Human-like races allow more scope for diplomacy and response to an alien culture, because their societies are fundamentally comprehensible by humans.

### The Like and the Others

Most alien races in the universe of ***Stars Without Number*** can be divided up into two different classes &ndash; the Like and the Others. The Like are those species with intellects and societies that are at least somewhat comprehensible to humankind. They may have exotic biologies and strange customs, but humans can understand their motivations and deal with them within a more-or-less comprehensible framework.

The Others are those species that are simply too alien for human communication. Entities of sentient lithic structures, congeries of crystal, even intelligent waveform interactions created by the interplay of energies through alien rock formations&hellip; the Others are simply too different for humans to understand. Their goals are incomprehensible, their technology is often hard to even recognize, let alone use, and it's possible that they don't even realize that humanity is a sentient species. The Others are generally avoided if at all possible, though at times “wars” break out when an Other species vents anger on humanity for reasons unknown.

Other races are rare, but some xenologists have suggested that they may be much more common than humanity imagines. Places that would never support Like life might be teeming with the bizarre offspring of Other organisms, unnoticed because human scouts haven't bothered to look in such unpromising places. Many Other species might not even be recognized as life by humanity.

### Alien Biology

As a rule of thumb, it's easiest to make Like aliens some flavor of humanoid. They may have a few extra limbs or somewhat different body geometry, but humanoid aliens tend to be easier to build and run than those with drastically different body types. There's less need to adjust human assumptions about architecture, technology, and clothing than there would be for a species of six-legged centauroid mothmen. Of course, if you enjoy the prospect of working out the ramifications of having four gripping hands and organic wheels, you shouldn't feel shackled to the humanoid shape.

Aliens of the Other type can come in any shape or size, largely because they aren't intended to be comprehensible. Their technology and architecture doesn't need to have any link with human conceptions of such; some Others may not even use technology as humans understand it, but instead manipulate their environment with inborn abilities or subtype-creatures of their own species. Most Other species function as plot devices in a game, and it's not necessary to put the same effort into detailing their “biology” if the species aren't intended to make human sense in the first place.

Humanlike aliens are just that; extremely close to humans in outward appearance. They might have unusual skin or hair coloration, different hair growth distributions, an odd number of fingers, cranial ridges, a novel skin texture, variant ear shapes, or different average body builds or sizes, but they largely appear like humans. Xenobiologists postulate that the human shape is simply a very successful evolutionary route on Earth-like planets, and other worlds with similar conditions are likely to produce similar sapients. Crank scientists tend to favor theories of pan-galactic Creators that spread humanlike shapes throughout space; these theories conspicuously fail to take into account the dramatically different DNA and internal organ makeup of many humanlike aliens.

In general, it's easiest to pick a particular real-world type of organism as a basic template for an alien race. The reality of their biology might be totally different, but using a terrestrial animal as a basic pattern can help you fill in details of structure and appearance that can otherwise be difficult to extemporize.

Avian aliens favor birdlike features. Feathered tails, wings, beaks, drastic coloring differences between males and females, skin either partially or fully covered in feathers, hollow bones, and clawed feet and hands are all traits that might be present in an avian-flavored alien. Such avians might have remarkably good vision or show unusual talent as pilots thanks to an evolutionary predilection for thinking in three dimensions.

Reptilian aliens can range from the classic “lizard man” look to a more subtle combination of pebble-scaled skin, membrane frills, broad bodies, cold-bloodedness, nictitating membranes, an exceptional sense of smell, thick claws, powerful builds, sharp teeth, and fine scales. Bodies may be broad and thick like that of a lizard, or perhaps sinuous like that of a snake. Reptilian aliens might be found especially on damp, watery worlds, and might be outright amphibious over all or part of their life spans.

Insectile aliens are usually possessed of chitinous “skin” and one or more pairs of compound eyes. Membranous wings aren't unknown, but are probably vestigial and useless on all but the smallest or lightest aliens. Insectile aliens might have sucking mouthparts if their primary food source is plant sap- or blood- or might use chewing mandibles instead for a more solid diet. Insectile aliens that function as a hive collective are something of a classic trope, but there's no reason that a species can't instead take after more solitary hunting insects such as beetles or spiders.

Mammalian aliens might have very human-like appearances, or they might have fur, muzzles, claws, or quadrupedal modes of locomotion. Mammalian aliens are easy to conceptualize and describe, but if you want to play up the alienness of them, you'll likely need to make sure they have some dramatic social or cultural difference, or some unique element of physiognomy.

Exotic aliens are built out of parts and materials that aren't normally found in Terran life forms. A humanoid might be composed out of a kind of organic plastic that makes up much of their home planet's biochemistry, or be composed of an intricate array of interlocking crystals and woody organic elements. You should pick one or more materials that aren't normally part of an animal's body and have them play a major role in the alien's biology. As a consequence, this kind of alien is probably highly dependent upon their home world for food and other biological necessities. If not, they likely spend a lot of effort synthesizing vital materials out of local supplies.

Hybrid aliens combine aspects of two or more of the types described here, and you can mix and match their components to create some blend that suits your purposes. Such hybrids might exist in multiple environments, or be in a transitional evolutionary state.

### Alien Psychology and Lenses

There are many different ways to fabricate a useful and interesting alien race, ranging from careful development based on unique biologies or environments to more abstract methods of defining interesting traits. The method this section offers is intended to provide a GM with a few tools for producing alien races that feel sufficiently strange in play without leaving the GM groping to figure out how a given alien would react to a situation.

The first step is to understand that a Like alien race is fundamentally human. They may be shaped differently, they may dwell in a radically different environment, but they think, feel, and desire largely as humans do. Human vices and virtues almost certainly exist in their society and they are susceptible to the same sort of temptations and provocations that move humans. If you want to know what an alien is like, the first thing to do is to think of what a human is like.

The difference for aliens, however, is that they are very strongly influenced by one or two emotional or social traits, called ***Lenses***. Everything about them, from the way their society is structured to the way they deal with strangers to the dreams they have for their own future revolves around these Lenses. The result is an alien culture that may not be deeply nuanced, but it is a culture that is very easily remembered by players and easily played by GMs. If you know that the two Lenses for the alien race of Churq are Collectivity and Fear, you know that a given Churq is going to be cowardly and intensely social. Courageous individuality will be noxious or incomprehensible to it and its social roles will revolve around the safety of the collective against the dreadful perils of the outside world.

Lenses should not be taken as the last word about a species. GMs who want to spend more time on the species' psychology can elaborate as they wish, and all of the guidelines given for a Lens can be easily adjusted to whatever flavor the GM wishes to use. GMs can pick or roll one or more Lenses from among the following list, or generate their own as desired.


### Table - Lenses

| d20 | Lens         | d20 | Lens       |
|:---:| ------------ |:---:| ---------- |
|  1  | Collectivity | 11  | Journeying |
|  2  | Curiosity    | 12  | Joy        |
|  3  | Despair      | 13  | Pacifism   |
|  4  | Domination   | 14  | Pride      |
|  5  | Faith        | 15  | Sagacity   |
|  6  | Fear         | 16  | Subtlety   |
|  7  | Gluttony     | 17  | Tradition  |
|  8  | Greed        | 18  | Treachery  |
|  9  | Hate         | 19  | Tribalism  |
| 10  | Honor        | 20  | Wrath      |


### Collectivity

These aliens might be hive-like in their social structure, natural communists, or simply very closely attached to the customs and interests of their social group. The importance of the individual is thought to be minimal, and members will cheerfully and readily sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. To willfully refuse to accept the consensus of the whole is an unspeakable sin, and to be separated permanently from one's social group is a fate worse than death.

### Curiosity

This species is insatiably curious, constantly prying into the affairs of those around them. Spying for this race carries no opprobrium whatsoever, and while they may attempt to maintain privacy for certain doings, all assume it a given that matters will be discovered in the end. They love to explore new places and meet new sapients, and while they may be brutally indifferent to the fates or treatment of these beings, they're always eager to observe them. Their societies tend to operate in a profoundly transparent manner, and some view the keeping of secrets as an automatic indication of malicious intent.

### Despair

These aliens have fallen prey to a pervasive sense of failure and loss. Perhaps they are the remnants of a once-glorious empire or the survivors of some cataclysmic disaster for their people. What they once loved has been destroyed, and their sources of comfort and courage have failed them. Superficially, they might resemble those species that crave pleasure and indulgence, but their disports only serve to numb them to the existential gloom that taints the species. Their leadership is desultory at best, and sophisticated social structures tend to degrade into loose, diffident associations as their members no longer have the hope necessary to perpetuate them.

### Domination

These aliens are consumed by a desire to conquer and rule, both each other and any other species unfortunate enough to share the stellar neighborhood. Some among them can be fair and thoughtful rulers, but others are nothing more than vainglorious tyrants. Among themselves, society tends to be organized in intricate and clearly-marked hierarchies, with advancement progressing along both official and illicit routes. These aliens constantly test their leaders, forcing them to maintain their position through strength and cunning.

### Faith

Such a species is driven by religious concerns, organizing their society around their faith and its clergy. Most such species have a single faith. Others make do with a number of different religions, all followed with a fierce devotion. Challenges to this faith are not met with outrage so much as blank incomprehension; for these beings, the truth of their religions is so self-evident that it seems irrational to ever question it. Those who most perfectly embody the teachings of their creeds tend to become rulers, their lives and will taken as an example for others.

### Fear

These aliens live in constant fear. They may be natives of some lethal death-world, survivors of a species-annihilating cataclysm, or simply evolved from weak and easily-devoured prey animals. The world is terrifying to them, and their societies are based around hiding or protecting themselves from these dreads. The most revered members are those who are best hidden or best protected, and who can give protection and concealment to their fellows. Most of these races are quite cowardly by human measure, but occasionally they can be driven into a frenzy of terror in which they fight with the courage of the doomed.

### Gluttony

These aliens devour. They are rapacious consumers, whether it is of food, living space, energy, or some other resource. They will do almost anything to increase access to this resource and are deeply indifferent to the needs of other species, and often of their own fellows as well. To consume greatly is glorious for this species, with the greatest and most respected members being those who have the greatest stockpiles of the resource to consume, or who provide the most to their followers. The purpose of existence is to eat, and all good things are understood as different modes of devouring.

### Greed

These aliens are enormously greedy. Status depends almost entirely upon personal wealth, and their lives are spent in accumulating the greatest stores of value possible. Some focus on production, creating the wealth for their own benefit, while others seek to make a profit on trade. Some such greedy species have intricate property laws to safeguard what is accumulated, while others are little more than bandits among their own kind, too avaricious to let law interfere with their greed.

### Hate

There is something these aliens hate, and it defines their culture completely by their opposition to it. It may be these aliens are rampant xenophobes, loathing all who are not of their own kind. There may be acrid religious or political divisions among them, with individuals identifying completely with their sect and despising all the others. It could be an ancient enemy among the stars, a rival race that has wounded them so greatly as to be unforgivable. These aliens may spar and maneuver for power among their own kind, but all goals and individuals are to some degree subordinated to the needs of their immortal hate.

### Honor

Whatever sort of society the race has, it is one obsessed with honorable behavior. Members will obey the social mores and expectations of their roles at all costs. Personal sacrifice for the sake of upholding these principles earns a member glory and esteem. Gaining advantage by means of inappropriate behavior or failing in one's duty is shameful, and an entity that has compromised its honor too greatly may prefer death to continued existence.

### Journeying

This species has an incurable wanderlust. Perhaps they roam the stars in fleets of massive spike drive ships, or they may make steady circuits of the nearby stars to connect their worlds and exchange people among them. More technologically primitive species might sail the waves of alien seas or make nomadic journeys across the continents of their world. Few of these aliens can ever be happy in remaining in one place for long, and they are forever scouting new worlds and new lands simply for the pleasure of being there a little while.

### Joy

These aliens are relentless bon vivants, constantly in pursuit of pleasure and enjoyable excitement. Beauty, grace, and the inspiration of passion are their highest virtues. Those who produce the most exquisite art or inspire the most extravagant delight have effective rule over their fellows, though such species tend to be loosely-organized at best. The brute necessities of life are acknowledged as a necessity, but their societies are willing to sacrifice a great deal of efficiency and practicality for the sake of immediate satisfaction.

### Pacifism

The race is remarkably peaceful and nonviolent in nature. Few species survive while being totally averse to violent self-defense, but this race will never choose violence against living creatures as a means of gaining advantage or retaliating to wrongs. Among their own kind, violence is abhorrent and unnatural, and it is probable that the species is either herbivorous or subsists by photosynthesis. A pacifist race may be peaceful, but there are more ways to do injury than through personal violence; the cession of trade, the destruction of property, and the incitement of divisions and confusion among their enemies are all tools this race knows well. Pacifist species can also be quite oppressive at times, with an underclass constitutionally incapable of defending their possessions or privileges with force.

### Pride

These aliens are suffused with an enormous pride in their own culture and species, and instinctively consider themselves to be superior to the lesser beings they may encounter. A prideful species is not necessarily a hostile one; some such races have a certain sense of *noblesse oblige* toward their “lessers”, and some species' pride shows in a resolute refusal to lower themselves to deceit, cruelty, or avarice. More often, however, this pride manifests in a casual contempt for the interests of their inferiors, and a single-minded focus on personal advancement and glory among their own kind.

### Sagacity

These aliens love intellectual pursuits above all others. Logic, wisdom, and erudition are all prized as the best and most glorious expressions of their nature, and their rulers are invariably sage-kings of remarkable depth and breadth of understanding. Such understanding does not necessarily stand in well for good judgment, and sagacious alien civilizations are notorious for overreaching in their ambitions. Stupidity and ignorance are moral failings to this race, and some of them treat very harshly those species that they do not feel to be their intellectual peers.

### Subtlety

Such a species is enormously cunning and patient in character, willing to endure years of suffering calmly in order to bring about some intricate plan. They shun open display of emotions or opinions, masking such things behind protocols of bland correctness. To reveal one's true opinion about some contentious matter is a mark either of profound trust or a sign of obvious incipient treachery. The true ruler of such a species is almost never who it seems to be.

### Tradition

This species devoutly reveres the past and the ways of their ancestors. Social interactions are stiffly ritualized, and society is ornate with the customs, traditions, and habits of their forebears. Innovations of any kind are viewed with deep suspicion, and the most favored solutions to problems are those which have been employed before. Members of this species are intensely uncomfortable when forced to exercise their own judgment, and doing so in contravention to the past is almost impossible for them. Only when faced with a completely novel situation is any degree of personal initiative likely to be shown, and even in that case, the alien will try to reconcile it to some existing tradition.

### Treachery

This species is uniformly treacherous and untrustworthy. Bargains and agreements are kept only so long as they are useful to both participants, and truthfulness is simply a tool to be placed next to deceit. There is no sense of acrimony or anger among these aliens at the inevitable betrayals that make up their societies; they consider it good and laudable that an individual should seek its own best interests, and those who can most perfectly manipulate each other are naturally those most worthy to rule, for the health of the society directly influences the power of its head.

### Tribalism

The aliens are fiercely tribal, divided up into myriad small groups that are as often at war with each other as they are cooperating. Such tribes tend to be built along familial lines, though some tribes are volitional in nature, representing different political or philosophical groups. A given alien's loyalty is to its tribe before its species, and it is not uncommon for their enemies to use one group against another.

### Wrath

The race is hot-tempered, prone to fits of personal violence. Disputes are settled by force, though rarely to the point of death among their own kind. Outsiders can expect swift and bloody retaliation for any insult or slight, and the prospect of death rarely intimidates these beings. Their chief mode of emotional expression is anger; wrath at obstacles, fury at enemies, and a slow smoldering burn when neither are available.

## Alien Social Structure

Once the Lenses for a species are chosen, you'll need to establish a few important facts about the aliens. You need to make some decisions about their social structure, the goals of their leadership, their relationship with humanity, and the sort of examples that the PCs are likely to encounter.

Determining the social structure for the aliens can be done by answering a few basic questions and elaborating outward from the answers to whatever degree of detail you find useful or enjoyable. In most cases, whatever social structure you hit on will apply only to those aliens in a specific sector. Far-flung races might have wildly different modes of rule among their different fragments, assuming that biological necessity doesn't push them to certain kinds of societies.

First, decide how the species is ruled. You can roll randomly on the table below, or simply pick something that seems appropriate.


### Table - Social Structures

| d8  | Social Structure       |
|:---:| ---------------------- |
|  1  | Democratic             |
|  2  | Monarchic              |
|  3  | Tribal                 |
|  4  | Oligarchic             |
| 5-6 | Multipolar Competitive |
| 7-8 | Multipolar Cooperative |

- ***Democratic:*** The species has a broadly democratic organization, with individual members having a formal say in the choice of leadership. This voting need not necessarily be based on numbers; it might be a vote with money, military power, religious influence, possession of certain biological traits, or any other metric that makes sense to the aliens. Whatever the specific currency, politics for this race tends to revolve around persuasion and diplomacy rather than use of military force to determine species-wide policies. ^social-structure-democratic

- ***Monarchic:*** The species is ruled by a single being, with such rule justified by custom, biological imperative, divine mandate, personal influence, or familial ties. Such monarchic societies almost invariably have a “noble” caste of some kind to act as administrators and officials for the monarch, and they usually make up the pool from which new monarchs are chosen. The specific title for a monarch will usually depend on the justification for their rule: Chieftain, Emperor, Broodmother, High Priest, Dictator, Chief Elder, or so forth. ^social-structure-monarchic

- ***Tribal:*** The species is organized into multiple tribes based on lineage, philosophy, or geographical location. Tribes set their own laws and policies, and are prone to intense internal struggles over resources and status. There may exist a “paramount tribe” that inflicts its will upon the others through brute strength or traditional esteem. Tribal leaders tend to be personally distinguished, and usually have earned their position through personal accomplishments and the broad support of their tribemates. ^social-structure-tribal

- ***Oligarchic:*** The species is led by a number of powerful or revered figures who work in nominal harmony. Individual oligarchs might have their own goals, but no single member has the strength to enforce its will upon the whole. These oligarchs might be the product of hereditary inheritance, or individual members of the species might one day aspire to join their numbers. ^social-structure-oligarchic

- ***Multipolar:*** The species has more than one leadership organization. Roll 1d6; on a 1-2 it has two, 3-4 indicates three, and 5-6 indicates four. Roll on this table the requisite number of times to determine the nature of these organizations. Some such multipolar institutions operate in parallel; a tribal organization headed by one gender, for example, that determines the division of goods while a monarchic head of a different gender makes decisions about the race's relations with other species. Others are directly in conflict, such as a monarchy struggling against a democratic neighbor. ^social-structure-multipolar

Once you've determined the type of leadership the species favors, you can sort out any important details about their social structures. By default, you should assume that the aliens have some sort of analog for any job or role that humans find necessary. The Churq might be cowardly collectivists, but even they need plumbers, soldiers, and tax collectors. You can take whatever human society suits you as the base template and then interpret the relevant roles through the Lenses you've picked for the species.

For example, if the Churq have the Lenses of Fear and Collectivism, their tax collectors might be honored exemplars of communal redistribution, judiciously taking from those who have excess in order to give to those who have less. The Churq gladly offer resources to the tax collector, because the offering proves that they producing excess resources, which proves to them that they are secure and safe in their plenty. A Churq who fails to produce for the collective suffers gnawing terror at the idea of dangerous scarcity and will redouble its effort to contribute to the group.

Conversely, Churq soldiers might invariably be found in small groups, as an individual Churq is incapable of fighting effectively without the encouragement and safety of their brethren around them. They might specialize in terror attacks against enemy civilians, their intimate acquaintance with fear encouraging them to use it as a weapon against their enemies&hellip; their unarmed, noncombatant enemies, preferably. A war between Churq collectives might never have a single open battle, but instead a sequence of ambushes and terror attacks until one collective loses its nerve and submits.

### Alien Technology

Alien races tend to come in two different technological flavors. Some are quite technologically primitive, either through being too new to sapience to have had time to develop scientific arts, or because they are unfortunate enough to inhabit a very resource-poor world. Such aliens might demonstrate remarkable ingenuity in making the most of their surroundings, but some worlds make advancement prohibitively difficult for a species.

Other aliens possess spike drives, advanced weaponry, fusion power, and all the other ornaments of a sophisticated star-faring civilization. These aliens are usually the remnants of a more expansionistic period, colonies and outposts that have evolved into homeworlds for the survivors of the civilization. This golden age is normally terminated by some kind of species-wide disaster, whether natural in nature or the result of savage internal warfare. These worlds are usually too absorbed in their own affairs or ennui to have much interest in expansion.

Most advanced aliens have tech roughly equivalent to human TL4, though they're often slightly superior in some areas while being somewhat worse in others. A few old, sophisticated races have the equivalent of TL5, though these species often produce devices and artifacts that are difficult for humans to use effectively. A handful of alien worlds show technology that is simply impossible for humanity to replicate at any known tech level, with artifices and creations that seem more magic than mundane science.

### Aliens in the Sector

What role do these aliens play in the sector? Do they have their own sector homeworld, dominated by them and their kind, or do they instead live in enclaves on a human-ruled world? Do they live in orbital habitats, or convoys of massive spike drive ships? You should place the species according to your needs, preferably in a location that the players can be expected to eventually experience.

You should also make a few quick decisions about how these aliens are generally treated by humans, and how they treat humans in turn. Some dangerous or obnoxious species might be unable to function in human societies, while others might be normal citizens on a sophisticated pan-racial planet. Some beings might be horrific or repellent to humans through no fault of their own, and subject to persecution by those who live around their “alien ghettos”. Such aliens are likely to respond to the misuse much as humans might, albeit in ways strongly influenced by their Lenses. A Wrathful species might respond with brutal violence toward persecutors, while Joyful ones might try to win their tormentors over by demonstrating the beauty and delight they can bring to their friends.

### Alien Motivation

Individual aliens are likely to have as wide and varying a set of motivations as any human. Alien governments and ruling institutions, however, are liable to have more specific goals. Acquiring a new homeworld, ensuring the suppression of would-be pogromchiks, vengeance against a hated world or species, or any other such long-term goal would be suitable for an alien government.

The broad goals of an alien government are usually obvious, but the subtle plans and maneuvers they use to accomplish these purposes can be less clear. PC groups can be commissioned by alien officials to perform acts or retrieve objects that have no immediate relevance, only to discover later that they played a crucial role in some enigmatic gambit. By the same token, they might stumble across some alien operation that has no obvious purpose, earning bitter enmity for their disruption of plans they never knew existed.

In either case, there should usually be some way for the PCs to discover alien motivations, in the case that they actually care. It can be prohibitively difficult to negotiate with such beings without understanding their desires, and parties with little appetite for combat may be frustrated if they find their would-be counter-parties acting in an impenetrably obscure way. Some adventures might revolve heavily around the challenge of understanding an alien power's true goals and the steps they're willing to take to achieve them.

### Alien Player Characters

If a GM decides to allow players to play members of an alien race, she's going to need to do a little extra work. Each alien race is represented by a focus; to become a member of that race, the player spends their initial focus pick on choosing that origin. They then get the natural benefits of belonging to that alien species.

As a general rule, the GM should pick two of the following benefits to make up an alien's origin focus, or three if a couple of them are relatively minor perks. If the Vree-Tak are a Proud Warrior Race of aliens, they might have both an *Aptitude for Violence*, for example, and an *Origin Skill* related to combat.

It's also possible to apply particular weaknesses to an alien species as compared to a human baseline. Such weaknesses are rarely a significant game-balance consideration for PCs, however, as it's common for players to choose such alien races and then select classes and roles that are unhindered by the species' flaws. If you want to use a flaw as a game-balance tool in a species, make sure it's broad enough to hinder a wide range of concepts, and not just disqualify a few roles.

### Aptitude for Violence

All members of this species are good at hurting things. They gain a +1 bonus to their normal attack bonus. Thus, a 1st level alien Expert would have an attack bonus of +1 instead of +0, and a 1st level Warrior would begin with a +2 bonus.

### Environmental Native

As a minor perk, the alien is able to survive in a relatively common hostile environment, such as underwater, in hard vacuum, amid lethal radiation, or so forth. If the alien *requires* this environment, it's no net benefit at all.

### Innate Ability

All members of this species have one or more natural abilities beyond those possessed by humans. Perfect vision in the dark, tracking by scent, wireless tech interfacing, a lack of need for food and water, or some other talent might apply. As a quick inspiration, you can look at the equipment or cyberware list and give them the natural use of 2-3 items. Optionally, you might give them an ability equivalent to a single psionic technique, plus one point of Effort to fuel it if needed.

### Natural Defenses

The creature has a hard shell or sharp talons. The alien has a base Armor Class of 15 plus half their character level, rounded up. If you give them body weaponry such as claws or fangs, have it equivalent to a medium advanced weapon. Weaponry alone is a very small advantage, since it's so easy to acquire otherwise, so you might not count this as a benefit if all you give a creature is a sharp set of teeth.

### Origin Skill

All members of the species are particularly good at something. They might all be capable warriors, have unique technical aptitude, be persuasive speakers, or otherwise have a shared knack. Receive an appropriate skill as a bonus. Warrior-type races might be allowed to pick from either Punch, Shoot, or Stab.

### Psychic Aptitude

These aliens are all psychically gifted. The PC must either be a Psychic or take the Partial Psychic class option from the Adventurer class. Their maximum Effort score is increased by one point.

### Shapeshifting

The alien is either an amoeboid blob that can manipulate objects with extruded pseudopods and flow through small spaces, or it can actually mimic other species or objects. The former trait is a minor benefit at best, but the latter one might be sufficient to mimic biopsionic shapeshifting, or might have a more restricted range of possible shapes.

### Strong Attribute

All members of the species are strong, fast, tough, clever, perceptive, or charming by human standards. Pick an attribute appropriate to the alien; that attribute gains a +1 bonus to its modifier, up to a maximum of +3. Thus, an alien from an exceptionally strong species with a Strength score of 10 would have a Strength modifier of +1 instead of +0.

### Tough

The alien is big, or hardy, or made of unusually durable biological components. Whenever they roll their hit dice to determine their maximum [hit points](#^character-hit-points), the first die they roll always counts as the maximum. Thus, a first level Warrior alien would always start with 8 [hit points](#^character-hit-points). When rolling [hit points](#^character-hit-points) at second level, they'd count their first die as 8 and roll on from there. Further hit dice that roll a 1 are rerolled.

### Unusual Movement Mode

The alien can fly under normal gravity conditions, or make short-range teleportation hops, or can climb sheer walls as if they were flat. Whatever the details, they can use their Move action to travel unusually.

### Useful Immunity

The alien is impervious to some threat that's relatively common. A significant or common immunity, such as against bullets, lasers, edged melee weapons or the like would be a major benefit, while immunity to minor threats such as toxins, diseases, radiation, or falling damage might only qualify as a minor perk.

# FACTIONS

Interstellar merchant combines, tyrannical planetary empires, sinister cults of eugenic perfection&hellip; groups such as these all have a role to play in ***Stars Without Number***. Such organized, motivated groups are known as ***factions***, and this chapter describes ways in which a GM can use them to further events in a sector. Player characters that attain sufficient power and fame might even establish their own factions, and the rules below give ways to handle inter-faction fighting and the advancement of each group's goals.

## Using Factions in Your Game

The faction system in ***Stars Without Number*** is intended to provide a GM with a constant stream of background activity, adventure hooks, and visible setting reactions to PC actions. It is an optional system, one that a GM can take or leave as their own campaign suggests, but it can provide an interested GM with tools to simplify the business of running the campaign's background.

The faction system is not meant to be a stand-alone game that doesn't require GM involvement. It's not balanced for equivalence between sides, isn't designed to incentivize optimal play choices, and some situations will certainly require a GM to referee them. The system is, however, built to produce the kind of output that a working GM is likely to find most useful.

Some GMs will have no use for a formalized faction system. These people feel most comfortable simply dictating the outcome of conflicts and ambitions among the assorted groups and organizations in their campaign. When two groups clash, the results will be determined by what the GM thinks is most reasonable.

This is a perfectly valid way of doing things, and indeed, when a GM decides how some off-stage organization interacts with a fully-statted faction they're going to have to make calls like that anyway. Yet the disadvantages of such a method are twofold.

First, it lacks surprise for the GM. By definition, the reasonable thing always happens, and even the occasional randomizer tossed in produces results that are to some degree predictable to the GM. History and current affairs are full of wildly unlikely-seeming outcomes, however, and sometimes the GM can benefit by seeing a genuinely shocking result percolate out of some conflict. Even in the absence of the adventure hooks such surprises create, not knowing exactly how her campaign is going to shake out helps keep a GM interested in events.

Second, an unstructured system has few prompts to goad a GM into thinking of unexpected interactions between factions. A GM simply provided with a list of NPC groups to write events for will tend to reach for the interactions and outcomes that are foremost in their mind, implicitly going along with assumptions about how things should play out. If instead they're handed a slow-burn struggle between a militant terrorist group with fanatical zealots for an asset and a eugenics-loving religion with a crack team of lawyers, they're going to think somewhat harder about how these two factions might play out their conflict, and will get results that don't automatically feed their assumptions.

One of the easiest ways to use the faction system is as a news chyron for your campaign. After each faction turn, you can boil down events to a few sentences apiece and hand them to your players at the start of the next gaming session, letting them know what's on the news channels and underground gossip boards of your campaign. If your players get excited about one of the events, you can dedicate the next downtime between sessions to brewing up an adventure related to their efforts at involvement.

Another use of the system is as a way to formalize the setting reaction to PC actions. If the last adventure involved the PCs utterly discrediting the leader of a political party you're using as a faction, you might scratch off the Demagogue asset that the party had that represented that leader. A quick scribble gives you the news crawl next session telling the PCs that the leader had decided to step down to spend more time with her family.

The factions you write up are not the only organizations and groups in your world, but they are the ones the PCs are most likely to care about or the ones most pertinent to their current activities. You don't need to keep the same factions active all the time; if the campaign shifts focus halfway across the sector, you can simply freeze the local factions until the PCs get back in their zone of relevance. If you have the spare time and effort, you might even keep them running, letting the PCs discover how things shook out when and if they ever get back to that region of space.

In time, the PCs themselves can start creating their own factions to contend with rivals and seek influence on a scale impractical for a lone wanderer. While PC factions use all the same rules and faction turn actions as NPC ones, they have the tremendous advantage of being the focus of a veteran adventuring party's helpful interest. Almost anything that can be accomplished by faction turn actions can be done more quickly by the appropriate PC adventures.

This, of course, is an easy way for a GM to let the players write their own adventure content. So long as the PCs care about their pet factions or allied groups, their own ambitions and desire to help will practically create whole sessions worth of adventure outlines for you. Important NPCs in rival groups will become hated nemeses, hostile assets will become the targets of their bad intent, and the players will constantly be on the lookout for ways to augment their allies. For the sake of your own time and effort, you should let them.

## Factions, Assets, and Turns

A faction is any group that you intend to use as an important actor in the sector. In theory, any organization could qualify as a faction; every planetary government, business, religion, or club could be described with the rules given here. Still, that kind of exhaustive cataloging is neither practical nor profitable. Faction status should be reserved for those organizations that will do things important to the PCs or the background world. You should not bother creating more factions for your game than you are actually using at that moment. Save your effort for the groups that count.

It may be necessary to turn an organization into a faction in the course of play. If the PCs suddenly take a deep interest in a eugenic cult they recently faced on the jungle moon of Perihelion, it might be useful for the GM to turn the group into a formal faction, the better to understand how the PCs might injure it and what resources the cult might have to fight back. Or it might be that the PC group's interstellar trading cartel faction tries to topple a world's tyrannical government, thus making it worthwhile to define the tyrant's resources.

As a general rule, you shouldn't have more than five or six factions at the start of your campaign, and fewer is quite possible. Fewer than three tend to make for too much stability, however, and might not generate enough activity to make for interesting news reports and adventure hooks. Possible factions in a campaign might include criminal groups, local religions, planetary governments, political movements, terrorist organizations, noble houses, or any other band that might conceivably be someone the players care about or some group that might possibly hire or oppose the PCs.

## Defining a Faction

Factions have attributes consisting of six statistics, a homeworld, and one or more tags.

- ***Hit points*** measure a faction's cohesion, morale, and group unity. The higher a faction's hit points, the harder it is to break it up. A faction that loses hit points has lost cohesion somehow, either through the death of leadership, the demoralization of members, or the rise of fractious power blocs inside its structure. A faction needs time to recover from hit point damage. A faction's maximum hit points are based on its Force, Cunning, and Wealth, as given later in the chapter. ^faction-hit-point

- ***Force rating*** is the faction's general aptitude at applying physical violence, measured on a scale ranging from 1 to 8. A rating of 1 implies an organization with little or no aptitude for physical coercion, while a rating of 8 might be appropriate for a regional hegemon with a powerful, expansionist military. A high Force rating doesn't necessarily mean that the faction has much in the way of a standing army, but it does mean that the faction can think clearly about the use of force and is accustomed to military reasoning. Governments tend to have high Force ratings to represent police forces and military structures. Terrorist groups, mercenary bands, and other organizations that rely on brute violence also tend to have high Force ratings. ^faction-force-rating

- ***Cunning rating*** reflects the faction's skills at espionage, infiltration, internal security, and covert manipulation of other groups. A rating of 1 implies a completely visible faction with no resources for resisting infiltration, while a rating of 8 implies a faction of Illuminati unknown to all but a handful of paranoid conspiracy-mongers with tendrils of influence reaching to the farthest star in the sector. Eugenics cults, terrorist groups, spy agencies, and some religious groups tend to favor a good Cunning score. ^faction-cunning-rating

- ***Wealth rating*** indicates the faction's commercial, scientific, and industrial resources. A Wealth score of 1 means that the faction has little in the way of income or investments, no dedicated manufacturing facilities, and no laboratories or researchers available. A Wealth score of 8 is appropriate for some system-spanning merchant empire or the combine that runs the pretech manufactories of an untouched factory world. ^faction-wealth-rating

- ***FacCreds*** are a measure of the faction's general wealth and resources, spent to purchase and maintain assets or carry out faction operations. A FacCred doesn't necessarily represent a certain sum of credits so much as it represents logistics capability, available resources, and managerial focus. A faction on a primitive world may not have a single credit to its name, but its command of a legion of laborers and the food supplies necessary to feed them are a vast store of FacCreds all the same. All the credits in a sector do no good if they can't be effectively translated into a useful asset. ^faction-faccreds

Factions also accumulate ***experience points***. They gain these points from accomplishing goals, with the larger goals earning them correspondingly more experience points. Once enough experience is accumulated the faction can spend it to improve a rating. The higher the rating, the more experience is necessary to raise it. It's vastly more difficult to go from Force 7 to 8 than from Force 1 to 2. ^faction-xps

The faction's ***homeworld*** represents the location of its core leadership and support. Factions can always purchase assets and take actions on their homeworld, even if they lack any other assets there. By the same token, an enemy can always launch attacks against the faction on their homeworld if the enemy is able to move in its own assets. ^faction-homeworld

- ***Tags*** are special traits that relate to the faction's nature or special aptitudes. A cabal of rebel conspirators might have the *Secretive* tag, which gives a bonus to resisting certain attacks, or *Deep Roots*, which gives them a bonus to operations on their homeworld. Most factions have one or two tags. ^faction-tags

## Faction Assets

Aside from the six statistics, faction also possess ***assets***. Assets are facilities, contacts, trained units of specialists, or other specific objects, places, or groups of value. A regiment of postech infantry is an asset, as is a pretech manufactory, a master assassin, or an interstellar shipping company. ^faction-asset

Assets require certain ratings to support. A fleet of capital warships isn't going to be useful to a faction with Force 3 no matter how much wealth the faction has. It just doesn't have the infrastructure and institutional mindset to use such an asset effectively.

Assets have ***hit points*** much like factions do. An asset reduced to zero hit points by an attack is destroyed; either physically ruined, hopelessly scattered, totally demoralized, or lost to a rival buyer. Asset hit points can be regained with time for repair, reorganization, or culling members suborned by other powers. ^faction-asset-hit-points

Assets have a ***purchase cost*** and sometimes a maintenance cost, paid in FacCreds. The first turn that a faction fails to pay the maintenance cost of an asset, it becomes unavailable for use. If the maintenance cost isn't paid the next turn, the asset is lost. ^faction-asset-purchase-cost

Assets often have an ***Attack***. When an asset is used to strike at another faction, the attack entry is used to determine what rating is attacked and the amount of hit point damage that is done by a successful hit. An asset without an Attack entry can't be used to initiate a strike at an enemy faction. ^faction-asset-attack

A ***Counterattack*** line indicates the damage an asset does to an unsuccessful attacker. If an attacking asset misses its strike against the target, the target's Counterattack entry damage is done. An asset without a Counterattack entry does no damage to a failed attacker. It's quite possible to have an asset with no Attack but a powerful Counterattack, making it useless at offense but very dangerous to assault. ^faction-asset-counterattack

Assets have a ***type***, such as “Special Forces”, “Military Unit”, “Facility”, “Starship” or the like. This type is mostly relevant when factions wish to upgrade an asset, or some special tag applies only to assets of a certain type. ^faction-asset-type

Assets have a ***location***, usually the planet on which they were purchased, though it might also be a deepspace habitat, a particular moon, or some other general geographical location. Assets cannot be used against different locations unless they are first transported there, usually by means of a logistical asset. ^faction-asset-location

Most assets also require a particular ***tech level*** to purchase. They can be transported to worlds with lower tech levels, but they must be purchased on a planet with a sufficient level of technology. ^faction-asset-tech-level

A faction may own no more assets of a particular type than they have points in the relevant rating. Thus, a faction with Force 3 can own three Force assets. In a pinch, a faction can exceed this total, but each asset over the maximum costs an additional FacCred in maintenance each turn.

## The Faction Turn

Faction actions are divided up by ***turns***. As a rule of thumb, a faction turn happens once per month, or once after each adventure. Turns might happen more or less often depending on the GM's preferred pace of events. Each faction can usually take one action per turn. ^faction-action-turns

At the beginning of each turn, roll a die that's no smaller than the number of factions you have. Thus, if you've got six factions in the sector, roll a d6. If you've got nine, roll a d10, and so forth. Whatever number comes up is the faction that acts first; thus, if you roll a 4, the fourth faction on your list acts first. Then the one after it, and the one after that, and so forth, rolling over the top of the list when necessary.

At the beginning of each turn, a faction gains FacCreds equal to half their Wealth rating rounded up plus one-quarter of their total Force and Cunning ratings, rounded down. Any maintenance costs must be paid at the beginning of each turn. Assets that cannot be maintained are unusable; an asset that goes without maintenance for two consecutive rounds is lost. A faction cannot voluntarily choose not to pay maintenance.

If a faction has no goal at the start of a turn, they may pick a new one. If they wish to abandon a prior goal, they may do so, but the demoralization and confusion costs them that turn's FacCred income and they may perform no other action that turn.

At the end of each faction turn, the GM should translate the turn's events into a few lines of rumor or news that can be related to the PCs. A successful attack by the Lawyers of the Bright Dawn Guild on the Perihelion government's Union Toughs might be reported as “Neohuman rights activists on Perihelion applaud the election of Parminder Smith to the leadership of the government-sponsored Transit Workers Union. Miss Smith is a strong supporter of neohuman research and legal emancipation.”

## Acting During A Turn

Factions can take several different types of actions, though generally only one action per turn. The list provided consists of the usual actions a faction might find useful; you should feel free to allow variations on the list depending on the particular situation. PC adventures always exist outside of the faction turn economy. If you run an adventure involving the PC group's destruction of the Sorority of the Golden Flame's secret laboratories on a volcanic planetoid, then the faction's asset is simply destroyed, with no chance of resisting.

A faction can only take one type of action per round, but they can perform that action on as many worlds as they wish. A faction that selects the *Attack* action, for example, can launch attacks on multiple worlds, while one that selects the *Use Asset Ability* action can use the special abilities of any or all assets they possess. This limit on the type of action allowed in a round tends to slow down events, allowing for the more gradual development of situations in play.

## Faction Actions

The following list of actions includes the most common activities a faction might choose to perform. The GM should feel free to add new action types, or allow alternate choices if a faction wishes to do something that doesn't quite fit the list below. As a rule, a faction should only be able to do one thing per turn, but should be able to do that same thing with any or all assets.

***Attack:*** Attacking is the chief way by which a faction assaults a rival's assets and organizational structure. A successful attack can damage or destroy an enemy asset, or even damage the leadership and cohesion of an enemy faction. It's up to the GM or players to describe an attack and its methods. ^faction-action-attack

Attacks can only be launched against known assets. If a rival has stealthed assets on a world, they cannot be targeted for an attack until they've been discovered by a faction's intelligence agents. Attacks can only be launched against assets on the same world as the attacker.

To launch an attack, the attacker selects one or more of their own assets and targets a rival faction with assets on the same world. One at a time, each attacking asset is matched against a defending asset chosen by the defender. Each attacking asset can attack only once per turn, though a defending asset can defend as many times as the defender wishes, assuming it can survive multiple conflicts.

Once matched, the attacker rolls 1d10 and adds the relevant attribute for the asset. For example, a military unit's Attack might add the faction's Force rating to the attack roll, while a cyberninja unit might add the faction's Cunning to the attack roll. The defender then rolls 1d10 and adds the attribute that the attack targets. In the instance of the military unit, this might be an attack against Force, causing the defender to add their Force rating to the roll, while defending against the cyberninjas might require adding the defender's Cunning rating. The Attack line of the attacking asset indicates which attribute to add to the attack roll and which to add to the defense roll.

If the attacker's roll exceeds the defender's roll, the attack is a success. The defending asset suffers damage as given on the Attack line of the attacking asset. If the defender has a Base of Influence on the world, the defender may opt to let the damage bypass the asset and hit the Base of Influence instead, causing damage to it and the faction [hit points](#^faction-hit-point). If the asset or Base of Influence is reduced to zero [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points), it is lost.

If the attacker's roll is less than the defender's roll, the attack fails. The defending asset can apply whatever damage their Counterattack line indicates to the attacking asset. If the defending asset has no Counterattack line, the attacker suffers no consequences for the failed attack.

A tie on the roll results in both Attack and Counterattack succeeding. Both attacker and defender take damage as indicated.

***Buy Asset:*** The faction buys one asset on their homeworld or another planet on which they have a Base of Influence. These assets take time to assemble, and can neither attack, defend, nor grant their special benefits until the beginning of the faction's next turn. The faction must have a sufficient rating to buy an asset, and the planet must have a tech level sufficient to support the asset's creation. Only one asset can be purchased by a faction per turn. ^faction-action-buy-asset

***Change Homeworld:*** A faction can move to a different homeworld, if they have a Base of Influence on the destination planet. This action takes one turn, plus one more for each hex of distance between the old homeworld and the new. During this time the faction can initiate no actions. ^faction-action-change-homeworld

***Expand Influence:*** The faction buys a Base of Influence asset on a planet on which they have at least one other asset. The faction then rolls 1d10+Cunning rating against similar rolls by every other faction on the planet. Any of the others that equal or beat the faction's roll may make a free immediate Attack action against the Base of Influence if they wish. Other assets present on the planet may defend against the attack as normal. The Base of Influence cannot be used until the beginning of the faction's next turn. ^faction-action-expand-influence

To buy a Base of Influence, the purchaser pays one FacCred for every hit point the base has, up to a maximum equal to the faction's maximum [hit points](#^faction-hit-point). Bases with few [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) are relatively peripheral outposts, easy to dislodge but cheap to erect. Bases with many [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) are significant strongholds that would hurt the faction badly to lose but are much harder to eliminate.

Factions may use this action to buy additional [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) for a Base of Influence, paying one additional FacCred up to the maximum HP allowed. It is possible to decrease a base's [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) with the action as well, albeit without refunds. The base on a faction's homeworld cannot be shrunk this way.

***Refit Asset*** Change one asset to any other asset of the same type. If the new asset is of a more expensive type, pay the difference. The asset must be on a planet that allows the purchase of the new asset. Turning a militia squad into elite skirmishers requires a tech level 4 world and governmental permission, for example. A refitted asset is unable to attack or defend until the beginning of the faction's next turn. ^faction-action-refit-asset

***Repair Asset/Faction:*** Heal damage to an asset or faction. For one FacCred, an asset heals points of damage equal to the faction's score in its ruling attribute. More damage can be healed in this single action, but the cost of repair increases by one FacCred for each further amount repaired- two FacCreds for the second amount healed, three FacCreds for the third amount healed, et cetera. If used to heal a faction, the faction regains [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) equal to the rounded average of its highest and lowest attribute ratings. This healing cannot be hurried by additional spending. Use of this action allows the faction to heal as many different assets as it wishes. ^faction-action-repair-asset-faction

***Sell Asset:*** Gain half the FacCred cost of the asset, rounded down. ^faction-action-sell-asset

***Seize Planet:*** The faction seeks to become the ruling body of a world. The faction must destroy all unstealthed assets on the planet belonging to factions who oppose their attempt before they can successfully take control. If all the assets cannot be destroyed in one turn, the faction must continue the attempt next turn until either successful or all of their own assets on that planet have been destroyed or have left the planet. No other actions can be taken in the meanwhile. Once all resistance has been crushed, the attacker must maintain at least one unstealthed asset on the world for three turns. If successful, they gain the *Planetary Government* tag for the world. ^faction-action-seize-planet

***Use Asset Ability:*** Use the special abilities of one or more assets, such as the transport ability of logistics assets, or the intelligence-gathering abilities of spy assets. ^faction-action-use-asset-ability

## Handling Special Cases

When in doubt, a GM should simply make a judgment based on their own best sense of the situation. Despite this general case, there are a few more particular situations that come up often enough to bear some specific guidance in handling them.

Sometimes, a ground unit will choose to attack a starship unit, or some other unit that seems to be beyond their reach. As a general rule, you should allow this, and simply decide how it was that the ground unit was able to cause problems for the starships. Maybe they subverted officers, or sabotaged support facilities, or drove logistical suppliers out of business.

Some assets require the permission of the planetary government to raise them on a particular world or move them into that world's system. The necessity of this will depend on how advanced the planetary government is and how direct the contact. A TL2 planetary government probably wouldn't even notice the arrival of a capital fleet in their star system, let alone be able to do anything to prevent it. Even so, native lawyers, bribed offworlder officials, and hired mercenaries might still be able to harass a force the locals couldn't bar from entering their territory.

Locations are considered general to a specific star system rather than a particular world. The faction's marketers might be operating out of the planetary capital, but for purposes of location, they're as much in the system as a Scavenger Fleet floating around the rim. Getting shuttles to and from wherever they need to go inside the system is not a problem for most factions.

Sometimes two factions will want to merge for some reason. The efficiency of this will depend on how much the factions like each other and how close they are in function; give this propinquity a rating from 1, for two factions that hate each other and don't do similar things at all, to 9, for two factions that are in perfect synchrony. Use 6 for two factions of average similarity. Whenever you need to see how well the merger went, roll a compatibility check; 1d10 versus this number. If the roll is equal or less, it worked, and if it's higher, the merger didn't work so well in that regard.

Now determine the Force, Wealth, and Cunning ratings for the new faction. For each one, roll a compatibility check; on a success, use the higher of the two factions' scores, while on a failure, use the lower one.

For each asset, roll a compatibility check; on a success, the asset belongs to the new faction, on a failure, it's forcibly sold. FacCreds are totaled between the two factions, and the merged faction gets all the Bases of Influence each originally had. Pick a new goal as well. If the faction has assets its new ratings can't support, it keeps them, but can't use *Repair Asset* on them.

PC adventures always overrule faction die rolls. If the PCs undertake an adventure which results in the crippling or destruction of a hostile faction's asset, that asset is destroyed without any need for dice. In the same vein, if they swoop in to rescue some asset that the dice declared was ruined and undertake an adventure that plausibly salvages the situation, that asset comes back into existence. The faction system is built to help create adventure hooks, not shut them down.

By the same token, if a PC adventure seems to plausibly *create* an asset for a faction, then that should be credited to the group. It is entirely in your interest as a GM to let the players plot out adventure goals and find motivation in helping a faction. Every adventure they spend helping or harming a faction is one more hook of engagement with the campaign world and one less adventure idea you need to come up with.

If your factions are too quiet with a lack of interesting conflict among them, don't hesitate to create that conflict. A sector full of turtling factions that hide out and painstakingly build their resources doesn't make for much engagement, so insert a personal grudge or add a gold-rush opportunity.

When a faction buys an asset, they are not necessarily creating something *ex nihilo*. They might have always had that particular resource, but are only now mobilizing it effectively. A planetary government with no military assets doesn't necessarily lack an army, it just lacks an army that is useful to its current goals. buying and using assets

Assets can be normally purchased on any world that has a Base of Influence and sufficient tech level to support their creation. In a few cases, however, acquiring an asset requires more than just FacCreds and a planet.

Starship-type assets cannot be purchased on a world with less than several hundred thousand inhabitants unless they can explain how the ships are being provided or supported by another power. Planets with very small populations lack such major infrastructure.

Some assets require the permission of a planetary government in order to purchase them or move them onto the planet. This is not a formality; the standing government's forces can physically disrupt any attempt to recruit the asset on their world, or shoot it down in its vulnerable entry phase. Whether or not this permission will be extended will usually depend on the faction's relationship with a planet's government, though bribes of 1d4 FacCreds can occasionally suffice. Under no conditions will a government willingly permit the entry of assets powerful enough to overthrow them.

Planetary governments cannot prevent the landing of assets without the permission-needed quality. Such assets are too unthreatening and nondescript to alert them until after they've already been formed or have landed. Of course, there is nothing stopping them from attacking these assets either directly or indirectly should they feel threatened.

Only one asset can be purchased per turn by a given faction, and assembling it takes time. The asset can neither attack, defend, nor give any special benefits until the beginning of the buyer's next turn.

## Using Faction Assets

As its action for the turn, a faction can choose to use the special actions of one or more assets. They can trigger these special abilities in any order, but each form of asset must be used all at the same time; you cannot trigger Heavy Drop Assets to move a Monopoly asset onto a world, activate the Monopoly ability to siphon cash, and then use another Heavy Drop Asset to move the Monopoly back offworld. All Heavy Drop Assets must be finished before Monopolies can be triggered, and so forth. Unless specified otherwise, all asset targets must be in the same stellar system with the acting assets.

In some cases, assets are called to make a test against another faction, such as a Cunning vs. Wealth test. For these tests, the acting asset's faction rolls 1d10 and adds their score in the acting attribute, while the target faction rolls 1d10 and adds their score in the defending attribute. If the actor rolls higher than the defender, the action is successful. Certain tags may grant a faction extra dice for these rolls, in which case the highest d10 out of those rolled is used. These tests do not count as attacks, and no damage or counterattacks are triggered.

## Bases of Influence

Bases of Influence are special assets, and use certain special rules. A faction cannot buy assets on a world without a Base of Influence, though it can move assets purchased elsewhere onto the planet, and it can always buy assets on its homeworld even if its Base of Influence there is destroyed. Of course, that assumes it still has a Base of Influence somewhere else.

First, a faction can only ever have one Base of Influence on a world at a time. Bases of Influence cannot be moved once in place. Bases of Influence cannot be purchased with a *Buy Asset* action. They can only be put in place with an *Expand Influence* action. Bases of Influence have a sale value of zero FacCreds.

The cost of a Base of Influence is equal to its maximum [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points), which can be up to the owning faction's maximum [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points). Bases of Influence do not count against a faction's maximum assets.

Damage done to a Base of Influence is also done directly to a faction's [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points). If a Base of Influence is brought below zero [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points), the overflow damage is not counted against the owning faction's [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points).

As a consequence, a faction must decide how heavily to invest in a particular Base of Influence. A minor foothold on a world consisting of a base with few [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points) is cheap and risks limited harm to the faction should it be destroyed, but it's also more vulnerable to being wiped out by a rival group.

It's quite possible for a faction to be effectively destroyed by smashing enough heavily-invested Bases of Influence on other worlds. While the homeworld's Base might be in perfect condition, the faction has so badly overextended itself in failed expansion that it can no longer sustain itself as a going concern. The resources and personnel that the homeworld needed to import are no longer available, and the credits and effort spent on the now-destroyed Bases are wasted. The backlash from this can be ruinous to any faction.

Every faction also has a homeworld. A homeworld is always automatically equipped with a Base of Influence with maximum [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points). If a faction moves its homeworld to a planet that already has a Base of Influence, the base on the new homeworld has its [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points) set to the maximum possible and the homeworld's Base of Influence swaps in the hit point value that the destination world's base originally had.

## Faction Goals

Factions usually have motivations and goals beyond simple existence. To grow, a faction needs to accomplish goals that are in line with their leadership's purposes. Successful achievement of these goals helps the faction grow in strength and influence.

A faction can pursue one goal at a time. Once a goal is successfully attained, the faction may select a new one at the beginning of their next turn or delay until a good opportunity arises. If a faction chooses to abandon a goal, the demoralizing effect of it and the waste of preparations costs them that turn's FacCred income, and they cannot perform any other action that turn.

A faction that successfully accomplishes a goal gains experience points equal to the goal's difficulty. This experience may be saved, or spent at the beginning of any turn to increase the Force, Cunning, or Wealth ratings of a faction. Optionally, the GM might allow a faction to buy a new tag if their deeds justify it.

It's the GM's choice as to what might constitute an appropriate goal for a faction, but below are some potential goals and the difficulties attached to each.

- ***Military Conquest:*** Destroy a number of Force assets of rival factions equal to your faction's Force rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed. ^faction-goals-military-conquest

- ***Commercial Expansion:*** Destroy a number of Wealth assets of rival factions equal to your faction's Wealth rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed. ^faction-goals-commercial-expansion

- ***Intelligence Coup:*** Destroy a number of Cunning assets of rival factions equal to your faction's Cunning rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed. ^faction-goals-intelligence-coup

- ***Planetary Seizure:*** Take control of a planet, becoming the legitimate planetary government. Difficulty equal to half the average of the current ruling faction's Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings. If the planet somehow lacks any opposing faction to resist the seizure, it counts as Difficulty 1. ^faction-goals-planetary-seizure

- ***Expand Influence:*** Plant a Base of Influence on a new planet. Difficulty 1, +1 if the attempt is contested by a rival faction. ^faction-goals-expand-influence

- ***Blood the Enemy:*** Inflict a number of [hit points](#^faction-asset-hit-points) of damage on enemy faction assets or bases equal to your faction's total Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings. Difficulty 2. ^faction-goals-blood-the-enemy

- ***Peaceable Kingdom:*** Don't take an Attack action for four turns. Difficulty 1. ^faction-goals-peaceable-kingdom

- ***Destroy the Foe:*** Destroy a rival faction. Difficulty equal to 1 plus the average of the faction's Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings. ^faction-goals-destroy-the-foe

- ***Inside Enemy Territory:*** Have a number of stealthed assets on worlds with other planetary governments equal to your Cunning score. Units that are already stealthed on worlds when this goal is adopted don't count. Difficulty 2. ^faction-goals-inside-enemy-territory

- ***Invincible Valor:*** Destroy a Force asset with a minimum purchase rating higher than your faction's Force rating. Thus, if your Force is 3, you need to destroy a unit that requires Force 4 or higher to purchase. Difficulty 2. ^faction-goals-invincible-valor

- ***World of Worlds:*** Spend FacCreds equal to four times your faction's Wealth rating on bribes and influence. This money is effectively lost, but the goal is then considered accomplished. The faction's Wealth rating must increase before this goal can be selected again. Difficulty 2. ^faction-goals-world-of-worlds

## Raising Faction Stats

Faction attributes can be raised at the beginning of each turn, if enough experience points are available. The cost of raising a faction attribute rises as the rating rises. As a faction's ratings improve, it becomes harder to destroy, and gains additional maximum [hit points](#^faction-hit-point).

The maximum [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) of a faction are equal to 4 plus the experience point cost of the highest attributes in Force, Cunning, and Wealth they have attained. For example, a faction with Force 3, Cunning 2, and Wealth 2 has a maximum hit point total of 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 12 [hit points](#^faction-hit-point). A brand-new faction with Force 1, Cunning 2, and Wealth 1 has a maximum [hit point](#^faction-hit-point) total of 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8 [hit points](#^faction-hit-point).

Experience points spent by factions differ from those gained by PCs in that they are lost when they increase an attribute. Once a faction spends 4 XP to raise Force from 2 to 3, for example, those points are lost, and 6 more must be spent to raise Force from 3 to 4.

### Table - Faction Experience Points

| Rating | XP Cost | Hit Point Value |
|:------:|:-------:|:---------------:|
|   1    |    -    |        1        |
|   2    |    2    |        2        |
|   3    |    4    |        4        |
|   4    |    6    |        6        |
|   5    |    9    |        9        |
|   6    |   12    |       12        |
|   7    |   16    |       16        |
|   8    |   20    |       20        |



## Cunning Assets

- ***Base of Influence:*** This asset is special, and is required for purchasing or upgrading units on a particular world. Any damage done to a Base of Influence is also done to a faction's [hit points](#^faction-hit-point). The cost of a Base of Influence equals its maximum [hit points](#^faction-hit-point), which can be any number up to the total maximum [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) of its owning faction. A faction's bases of influence don't count against their maximum assets. A Base of Influence can only be purchased with the *Expand Influence* action. ^cunning-assets-base-of-influence

- ***Blackmail:*** Selectively degrade the effectiveness of an asset. Any attempt to attack or defend against Blackmail loses any bonus dice earned by tags. ^cunning-assets-blackmail

- ***Boltholes:*** Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make cleaning them out a costly and dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the same planet as the Boltholes suffers damage sufficient to destroy it, it is instead set at 0 HP and rendered untouchable and unusable until it is repaired to full strength. If the Boltholes are destroyed before this happens, the asset is destroyed with them. ^cunning-assets-boltholes

- ***Book of Secrets:*** Exhaustively cataloged psychometric records on important and influential local figures, allowing uncanny accuracy in predicting their actions. Once per turn, a Book of Secrets allows the faction to reroll one die for an action taken on that world or force an enemy faction to reroll one die. This reroll can only be forced once per turn, no matter how many Books of Secrets are owned. ^cunning-assets-book-of-secrets

- ***Covert Shipping:*** Quiet interstellar asset transport. Any one Special Forces unit can be moved between any worlds within three hexes of the Covert Shipping at the cost of one FacCred. ^cunning-assets-covert-shipping

- ***Covert Transit Net:*** Facilities web an area of space with a network of smugglers and gray-market freighter captains. As an action, any Special Forces assets can be moved between any worlds within three hexes of the Covert Transit Net. ^cunning-assets-covert-transit-net

- ***Cracked Comms:*** A cryptographic asset for the interception and deciphering of enemy communications. Friendly fire can be induced with the right interference. If the Cracked Comms succeeds in defending against an attack, it can immediately cause the attacking asset to make an attack against itself for normal damage or counterattack results. ^cunning-assets-cracked-comms

- ***Cyberninjas:*** Outfitted with the latest in personal stealth cyberware, cyberninjas are designed to avoid all but the most careful scans. ^cunning-assets-cyberninjas

- ***Demagogues:*** Popular leaders of a particular faith or ideology that can be relied upon to point their followers in the direction of maximum utility. ^cunning-assets-demagogues

- ***False Front:*** This asset allows a faction to preserve more valuable resources. If another asset on the planet suffers enough damage to destroy it, the faction can sacrifice the false front instead to nullify the killing blow. ^cunning-assets-false-front

- ***Informers:*** Minions that lace a planet's underworld, watchful for intruders. They can choose to Attack a faction without specifying a target asset. On a successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack, all Stealthed assets on the planet belonging to that faction are revealed. Informers can target a faction even if none of their assets are visible on a world; at worst, they simply learn that there are no stealthed assets. ^cunning-assets-informers

- ***Lobbyists:*** Usable to block the governmental permission that is sometimes required to buy an asset or transport it into a system. When a rival faction gains permission to do so, the Lobbyists can make an immediate Cunning vs. Cunning test against the faction; if successful, the permission is withdrawn and cannot be re-attempted until next turn. ^cunning-assets-lobbyists

- ***Organization Moles:*** These can subvert and confuse enemy assets, striking to damage their cohesion. ^cunning-assets-organization-moles

- ***Panopticon Matrix:*** These facilities weave braked AI intelligence analysts into a web of observation capable of detecting the slightest evidence of intruders on a world. Every rival Stealthed asset on the planet must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning test at the beginning of every turn or lose their Stealth. The owner also gains an additional die on all Cunning attacks and defenses on that planet. ^cunning-assets-panopticon-matrix

- ***Party Machines:*** Political blocks control particular cities or regions&hellip; blocks that are firmly in control of the faction. Each turn, a Party Machine provides 1 FacCred to its owning faction. ^cunning-assets-party-machines

- ***Popular Movements:*** A planet-wide surge of enthusiasm for a cause controlled by the faction. This support pervades all levels of government, and the government always grants any asset purchase or movement requests made by the faction. ^cunning-assets-popular-movements

- ***Saboteurs:*** Minions rained in launching strikes against enemy operations. An asset attacked by saboteurs cannot apply any *Use Asset Ability* action until the start of the attacking faction's next turn. This applies whether or not the attack was successful. ^cunning-assets-saboteurs

- ***Seditionists:*** These asset sap a target's loyalty and will to obey. For a cost of 1d4 FacCreds, the Seditionists can attach themselves to an enemy asset. Until they attach to a different asset or no longer share the same planet, the affected asset cannot attack. If the asset is destroyed, the Seditionists survive. ^cunning-assets-seditionists

- ***Seductresses:*** They and their male equivalents subvert the leadership of enemy assets. As an action, a Seductress can travel to any world within one hex. As an attack, a Seductress does no damage, but an asset that has been successfully attacked immediately reveals any other Stealthed assets of that faction on the planet. Only Special Forces units can attack a Seductress. ^cunning-assets-seductresses

- ***Smugglers:*** Men and women skilled in extracting personnel. For one FacCred, the smugglers asset can transport itself and/or any one Special Forces unit to a planet up to two hexes away. ^cunning-assets-smugglers

- ***Stealth:*** Not an asset, per se, but a special quality that can be purchased for another Special Forces asset on the planet. An asset that has been Stealthed cannot be detected or attacked by other factions. If the unit normally requires the permission of a planetary government to be moved onto a planet, that permission may be foregone. An asset loses its Stealth if it is used to attack or defend. ^cunning-assets-stealth

- ***Transport Lockdown:*** These techniques involve selective pressure on local routing and shipping companies. On a successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack against a rival faction, the rival faction cannot transport assets onto that planet without spending 1d4 FacCreds and waiting one turn. ^cunning-assets-transport-lockdown

- ***Treachery:*** Traitors can attack an enemy asset. On a successful attack, the Treachery asset is lost, 5 FacCreds are gained, and the targeted asset switches sides to join the traitor's faction, even if the faction does not otherwise have the attributes necessary. ^cunning-assets-treachery

- ***Tripwire Cells:*** These observers are alert to the arrival of stealthed units. Whenever a stealthed asset lands or is purchased on a planet with tripwire cells, the Cells make an immediate Cunning vs. Cunning attack against the owning faction. If successful, the asset loses its stealth. ^cunning-assets-tripwire-cells

- ***Vanguard Cadres:*** Followers of the movement are inspired sufficiently to take up arms and fight on behalf of their leadership. ^cunning-assets-vanguard-cadres

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.


## Force Assets

 - ***Base of Influence:*** These follow the standard rules for Bases of Influence. ^force-assets-base-of-influence

- ***Beachhead Landers:*** A collection of short-range, high-capacity spike drive ships capable of moving large numbers of troops. As an action, the asset may move any number of assets on the planet, including itself, to any world within one hex at a cost of one FacCred per asset moved. ^force-assets-beachhead-landers

- ***Blockade Fleets:*** A ragtag lot of corsairs, pirates, privateers, and other deniable assets. When they successfully *Attack* an enemy faction asset, they steal 1d4 FacCreds from the target faction as well. This theft can occur to a faction only once per turn, no matter how many blockade fleets attack. As an action, this asset may also move itself to a world within one hex. ^force-assets-blockage-fleets

- ***Capital Fleets:*** The pride of an empire, this is a collection of massive capital warships without peer in most sectors. Capital fleets are expensive to keep flying, and cost an additional 2 FacCreds of maintenance each turn. As an action, they may move to any world within three hexes of their current location. Planetary government permission is required to raise a capital fleet, but not to move one into a system. ^force-assets-capital-fleets

- ***Counterintel Units:*** These security units specialize in code breaking, internal security, and monitoring duties. They can crack open enemy plots long before they have time to come to fruition. ^force-assets-counterintel-units

- ***Cunning Traps:*** This asset covers all the myriad stratagems of war, from induced landslides to spreading local diseases. ^force-assets-cunning-traps

- ***Deep Strike Landers:*** These advanced transport ships are capable of moving an asset long distances. As an action, any one non-Starship asset, including itself, can be moved between any two worlds within three hexes of the deep strike landers, at a cost of 2 FacCreds. This movement can be done even if the local planetary government objects, albeit doing so is usually an act of open war. ^force-assets-deep-strike-landers

- ***Elite Skirmishers:*** These lightly-equipped troops are trained for guerrilla warfare and quick raids. ^force-assets-elite-skirmishers

- ***Extended Theater:*** These facilities allow for transporting assets long distances. As an action, any one non-Starship asset, including itself, can be moved between any two worlds within two hexes of the extended theater, at a cost of 1 FacCred. ^force-assets-extended-theater

- ***Gravtank Formations:*** These tank formations are composed of advanced postech gravtank units that are capable of covering almost any terrain and cracking even the toughest defensive positions. ^force-assets-gravtank-formations

- ***Guerrilla Populace:*** Such assets reflect popular support among the locals and a cadre of men and women willing to fight as partisans. ^force-assets-guerrilla-populace

- ***Integral Protocols:*** A complex web of braked-AI supported sensors and redundant security checks used to defeat attempts to infiltrate an area. They can defend only against attacks versus Cunning, but they add an additional die to the defender's roll. ^force-assets-integral-protocols

- ***Militia Units:*** Groups of lightly-equipped irregular troops with rudimentary military training but no heavy support. ^force-assets-militia-units

- ***Pretech Infantry::*** The cream of the stellar ground forces, elite troops kitted out in the best pretech weaponry and armor available, with sophisticated heavy support weaponry integral to the unit. ^force-assets-pretech-infantry

- ***Pretech Logistics:*** These assets represent caches, smugglers, or internal research and salvage programs. As an action, a pretech logistics asset allows the owner to buy one Force asset on that world that requires up to tech level 5 to purchase. This asset costs half again as many FacCreds as usual, rounded up. Only one asset can be purchased per turn. ^force-assets-pretech-logistics

- ***Zealots:*** Members of the faction so utterly dedicated that they are willing to launch suicide attacks or hold positions to the death. Zealots take 1d4 damage every time they launch a successful attack or perform a counterattack. ^force-assets-zealots

## Eliminating Force Assets

> It's important to remember that a disabled or damaged Force asset hasn't necessarily been blown to pieces on a battlefield. When thinking of ways that a conflict might have harmed such an asset, remember that demoralization, confusion, subversion, and simple lack of upkeep might all cripple the effectiveness of an asset, or even destroy it as an effective force without rebuilding as expensive as buying a fresh asset. A navy with spacemanship skills so neglected as to constantly run ships into each other is just as worthless to its owning faction as a fleet of smoking wrecks, and the only damage done there was to the organization's focus.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.

### Wealth Assets

- ***Bank Assets:*** Once per turn, the faction can ignore one cost or FacCred loss imposed by another faction. This does not require an action. Multiple bank assets allow multiple losses to be ignored. ^wealth-assets-bank-assets

- ***Base of Influence:*** These follow the standard rules for Bases of Influence. ^wealth-assets-base-of-influence

- ***Blockade Runners:*** These starship captains excel at transporting goods through unfriendly lines. As an action, a blockade runner can transfer itself or any one Military Unit or Special Forces to a world within three hexes for a cost of two FacCreds. They can even move units that would otherwise require planetary government permission to enter. ^wealth-assets-blockade-runners

- ***Commodities Brokers:*** They substantially lessen the cost of large-scale investments by timing materials purchases properly. As an action, the owner of a commodities broker can roll 1d8; that many FacCreds are subtracted from the cost of their next asset purchase, down to a minimum of half normal price, rounded down. ^wealth-assets-commodities-brokers

- ***Franchise:*** This asset reflects a deniable connection with a local licensee for the faction's goods and services. When a Franchise successfully attacks a enemy asset, the enemy faction loses one FacCred (if available), which is gained by the Franchise's owner. This loss can happen only once a turn, no matter how many Franchises attack. ^wealth-assets-franchise

- ***Freighter Contract:*** A special link with heavy shipping spacers. As an action, the faction may move any one non-Force asset, including this one, to any world within two hexes at a cost of one FacCred. ^wealth-assets-freighter-contract

- ***Harvesters:*** These gather the natural resources of a world, whether ore, biologicals, or other unprocessed goods. As an action, the Harvesters' owning faction may roll 1d6. On 3+, gain one FacCred. ^wealth-assets-harvesters

- ***Hostile Takeover:*** This asset can seize control of damaged and poorly-controlled assets. If a Hostile Takeover does enough damage to destroy an asset, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point and acquired by the Hostile Takeover's owning faction. ^wealth-assets-hostile-takeover

- ***Laboratory:*** The lab allows a world to make hesitant progress in tech. The presence of a Laboratory allows assets to be purchased on that world as if it had Tech Level 4. ^wealth-assets-laboratory

- ***Lawyers:*** Sophists in immaculate suits or charismatic tribal skalds, lawyers have the ability to tie an enemy up in the coils of their own internal rules, damaging assets with confusion and red tape. Lawyers cannot attack or counterattack Force assets. ^wealth-assets-lawyers

- ***Local Investments:*** These give the faction substantial influence over the commerce on a world. Any other faction that tries to buy an asset on that planet must pay one extra FacCred. This money is not given to the investments' owner, but is lost. This penalty is only applied once. ^wealth-assets-local-investments

- ***Marketers:*** Deployed to confuse enemy factions into untimely investments. As an action, the marketers may test Cunning vs. Wealth against a rival faction's asset. If successful, the target faction must immediately pay half the asset's purchase cost, rounded down, or have it become disabled and useless until this price is paid. ^wealth-assets-marketers

- ***Medical Center:*** Salvage and repair damaged assets. Once between turns, if a Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the world is destroyed, the faction may immediately pay half its purchase cost to restore it with one hit point. Any *Repair Asset* action taken on that world costs one less FacCred for Special Forces and Military Units. ^wealth-assets-medical-center

- ***Mercenaries:*** Groups of well-equipped, highly-trained soldiers willing to serve the highest bidder. Mercenaries have a maintenance cost of one FacCred per turn. As an action, Mercenaries can move to any world within one hex of their current location. To purchase or move a Mercenary asset to a planet requires government permission. ^wealth-assets-mercenaries

- ***Monopoly:*** An open or tacit stranglehold on certain vital businesses or resources on a world. As an action, owners of a monopoly may force one other faction with unstealthed assets on that world to pay them one FacCred. If the target faction can't pay, they lose one asset of their choice on the world. ^wealth-assets-monopoly

- ***Postech Industry:*** As an action, the owning faction can roll 1d6 for a Postech Industry asset. On a 1, one FacCred is lost, on a 2-4 one FacCred is earned, and a 5-6 returns two FacCreds. If money is lost and no resources are available to pay it, the Postech Industry is destroyed. ^wealth-assets-postech-industry

 - ***Pretech Manufactories:*** Rare, precious examples of functioning pretech industrial facilities, retrofitted to work without the benefit of specialized psychic disciplines. As an action, the owning faction can roll 1d8 for a Pretech Manufactory, and gain half that many FacCreds, rounded up. ^wealth-assets-pretech-manufactories

- ***Pretech Researchers:*** A highly versatile team of research and design specialists capable of supporting limited pretech&hellip; as long as they're adequately funded. Any world with Pretech Researchers on it is treated as tech level 5 for the purpose of buying Cunning and Wealth assets. Pretech researchers have a maintenance cost of 1 FacCred per turn. ^wealth-assets-pretech-researchers

- ***R&D Departments:*** These allow the smooth extension of wealth-creation and industrial principles to the farthest reaches of the faction's operations. A faction with an R&D department may treat all planets as having tech level 4 for purposes of buying Wealth assets. ^wealth-assets-randd-departments

- ***Scavenger Fleets:*** These rag-tag armadas bring enormous technical and mercantile resources to their patrons, along with a facility with heavy guns. As an action, a Scavenger Fleet can be moved to any world within three hexes. Scavenger Fleets cost 2 FacCreds a turn in maintenance. ^wealth-assets-scavenger-fleets

- ***Shipping Combine:*** Transport large amounts of equipment and personnel between worlds. As an action, the combine may move any number of non-Force assets, including itself, to any world within two hexes at a cost of one FacCred per asset. ^wealth-assets-shipping-combine

- ***Surveyors:*** Explore potential resource and investment options on worlds. The presence of a Surveyor crew allows one additional die to be rolled on *Expand Influence* actions. As an action, a surveyor crew can be moved to any world within two hexes. ^wealth-assets-surveyors

- ***Transit Web:*** These facilities allow almost effortless relocation of all assets. For one FacCred, any number of non-starship Cunning or Wealth assets may be moved between any two worlds within three hexes of the Transit Web. This may be done freely on the owner's turn so long as the fee can be paid, and using the ability doesn't require an action. ^wealth-assets-transit-web

- ***Union Toughs:*** These bruisers don't much like scabs and management, and they're willing to take the faction's word on which people are which. They're lightly armed and poorly trained, but they can infiltrate to perform sabotage. ^wealth-assets-union-toughs

- ***Venture Capital:*** This asset grows resources out of seemingly nowhere, harvesting the best of entrepreneurship for the faction's benefit. As an action, venture capital can be tapped. 1d8 is rolled; on a 1, the asset is destroyed, while on a 2-3 one FacCred is gained, 4-7 yields two FacCreds and 8 grants three FacCreds. ^wealth-assets-venture-capital

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.

### Faction Tags

Most factions have some unique quality about them, some trait that distinguishes them from other factions of similar resources. Whether a particularly fanatical band of ideological crusaders or an ancient order of pacifistic scientists, faction tags allow a GM to give a group a few special tricks of their own.

A faction should generally be given one tag, or two at the most for particularly versatile organizations. The exception is the *Planetary Government* tag, which can be acquired&ndash; and lost&ndash; multiple times to reflect the faction's seizure of new worlds. Factions tags do not normally change without some drastic and organization-shaping event.

### Colonists

This faction is a fresh colony on an otherwise largely untouched planet. It is this brave band of pioneers that will tame the world's wild forces and bring forth a better life for those who come after.

- ***Effect:*** This faction has all the benefits of the *Planetary Government* tag for its homeworld, as no other government exists on a fresh colony. The faction's homeworld is also treated as if it had at least tech level 4. Colonies with fewer than 100,000 citizens lack the necessary industrial infrastructure to build Spaceship-type assets.

### Deep Rooted

This faction has been part of a world's life for time out of mind. Most natives can hardly imagine the world without this faction's presence, and the traditional prerogatives and dignities of the group are instinctively respected.

- ***Effect:*** This faction can roll one additional d10 when defending against attacks on assets on their homeworld. If the faction ever changes homeworlds, this tag is lost.

### Eugenics Cult

The forbidden maltech secrets of advanced human genetic manipulation are known to this faction, and they use them with gusto. Slave-engineered humanoids and “deathless” leadership are just two of the more common alterations these unstable scientists undertake.

- ***Effect:*** Eugenics Cultists can buy the Gengineered Slaves asset; it's an asset requiring Force 1 with the statistics of 6 HP, 2 FacCred cost, tech level 4 required, with an Attack of Force vs. Force/1d6 damage and a Counterattack of 1d4 damage. Once per turn, the Eugenics Cult can roll an extra d10 on an attack or defense by a Gengineered Slaves asset, regardless of the stat being used. Gengineered Slaves can count as either a Military Unit or Special Forces, determined when the cult first creates a specific asset.

### Exchange Consulate

This faction is either led through an Exchange Consulate or has close ties with that pacifistic society of bankers and diplomats. The sophisticated economic services they provide strengthen the faction.

- ***Effect:*** When the faction successfully completes a “Peaceable Kingdom” Goal, they may roll 1d6; on a 4+, they gain a bonus experience point. Once per turn, the faction may roll an extra d10 when defending against a Wealth attack.

### Fanatical

The members of this faction just don't know when to quit. No matter how overmatched, the members will keep fighting to the bitter end- and occasionally past it.

- ***Effect:*** The faction always rerolls any dice that come up as 1. This zealousness leaves them open at times, however; they always lose ties during attacks.

### Imperialists

This faction nurses wild dreams of controlling the sector, whether out of an impulse to bring their local culture and technology to less fortunate worlds or simple lust for dominion. They excel at defeating planetary defenses and standing armies.

- ***Effect:*** This faction may roll an extra d10 for attacks made as part of a Seize Planet action.

### Machiavellian

This faction's meat and drink is intrigue, its members delighting in every opportunity to scheme. It may be a secret cabal of hidden masters or the decadent court of a fallen stellar empire, but its membership has forgotten more of treachery than most others ever learn.

- ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional d10 when making a Cunning attack.

### Mercenary Group

The faction sells its services to the highest bidder, and is an extremely mobile organization. Vast amounts of men and material can be moved interstellar distances in just a few months.

- ***Effect:*** All faction assets gain the following special ability: As an action, the asset may move itself to any world within one hex.

### Perimeter Agency

This faction is or is closely tied to an Agency of the enigmatic Perimeter organization. Originally organized by the Terran Mandate to detect and contain maltech outbreaks until Mandate fleet resources could be dispatched, the Perimeter retains numerous ancient override codes for pretech security protocols.

- ***Effect:*** Once per turn, the faction may roll an additional d10 when making an attack against an asset that requires tech level 5 to purchase. The faction may roll an extra die when making a test to detect Stealthed assets.

### Pirates

This faction is a scourge of the spacelanes, driving up the cost of shipping and terrorizing merchant captains without pity. They steal and refit ships with vicious ingenuity, cobbling together space armadas out of the leavings of their prey.

- ***Effect:*** Any movement of an asset onto a world that has a Base of Influence for this faction costs one extra FacCred, paid to this faction.

### Planetary Government

This faction is the legitimate government of a planet. Rebel groups and rival factions may have assets on the planet, but control over the instruments of the state is firmly in this faction's hands. The faction may rule openly, or it may simply have an inexorable grasp on the existing authorities.

- ***Effect:*** The faction's permission is required to buy or import those assets marked as needing government permission. This tag can be acquired multiple times, once for each planet the faction controls.

### Plutocratic

This faction prizes wealth, and its membership strives constantly to expand and maintain personal fortunes. Perhaps it is a ruling council of oligarchs or a star-spanning trade cartel.

- ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional d10 when making a Wealth attack.

### Preceptor Archive

This faction is or has close ties to a Preceptor Archive a place of learning operated by the learned Preceptors of the Great Archive. These Archives are peaceful institutions dedicated to the spread of practical knowledge and useful engineering to the wider cosmos. Their large numbers of educated personnel make advanced equipment more practical for deployment.

- ***Effect:*** Purchasing an asset that requires tech level 4 or more costs one fewer FacCred than normal. The Preceptor Archive may also take the special action “Teach Planetary Population”, costing 2 FacCreds and allowing them to roll 1d12 for one world. On a 12, the world's tech level permanently becomes 4 for the purposes and purchases of this faction.

### Psychic Academy

Most significant factions are capable of employing psychics, but this faction can actually train their own. They excel at precise and focused application of the psionic disciplines, and can get far more out of their available psychic resources than other factions.

- ***Effect:*** This faction can provide psionic mentor training to qualified psychics. Once per turn, this faction can also force a rival faction to reroll any one d10, whether or not they're involved in the roll.

### Savage

Whether a proud tribe of neoprimitives struggling against the material limits of their world or a pack of degenerate tomb world cannibals, this faction is accustomed to surviving without the benefits of advanced technology and maximizing local resources.

- ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra die when defending with an asset that requires tech level 0 to purchase.

### Scavengers

This faction might live within the wreckage of a tomb world, salvage the castoffs of some decadent pleasure-world or ply the ruins of an orbital scrapyard. Whatever their territory, this faction knows how to find worth amid seemingly useless trash.

- ***Effect:*** Whenever the faction destroys an asset or has one of their assets destroyed, they gain 1 FacCred.

### Secretive

This faction is marked by elaborate protocols of secrecy and misdirection. It may be split up into numerous semi-autonomous cells, or consist largely of trained espionage professionals. Finding the assets of such a faction can often be more difficult than destroying them.

- ***Effect:*** All assets purchased by this faction automatically begin Stealthed. See the list of Cunning assets for details on Stealth.

### Technical Expertise

The faction is staffed by large numbers of expert engineers and scientists. They can turn even the most unpromising labor pool into superb technicians.

- ***Effect:*** This faction treats all planets on which they have a Base of Influence as if they were at least tech level 4. They can build Starshiptype assets on any world with at least ten thousand occupants.

### Theocratic

The faction is fueled by the fierce certainty that God is with them- and with no one else. The tight and occasionally irrational obedience that pervades the organization makes it difficult to infiltrate or subvert effectively.

- ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra d10 when defending against a Cunning attack.

### Warlike

There are factions with a military orientation, and then there are factions that just really love killing things. Whether or not this faction has developed sophisticated military resources and techniques, the membership is zealous in battle and has a positive taste for fighting.

- ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional d10 when making a Force attack.

# Factions in Your Campaign

To create a faction, first decide on the scale of the organization. Many factions are restricted to a single world, and even the most impressive sector empire rarely exerts direct control over more than a dozen worlds. Place the faction's homeworld and locate any Bases of Influence it might have on other worlds. A few words beside each Base describing the form it takes can be handy in later planning out adventures with the faction.

Next, prioritize the faction's attributes, deciding the order in which they focus on Force, Cunning, and Wealth. Minor factions should have a 4 in their most important attribute, established planetary governments should have a 6, and regional hegemons should have an 8. Their second-most important attribute is one less than their primary, and their tertiary attribute is three less. You can calculate the faction's [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) from that, but normally minor powers will have 15 HP, major powers will have 29 HP, and sector hegemons will have 49 HP. Their off-world Bases of Influence normally have a maximum HP equal to half that.

Give minor powers one asset in their primary attribute and one asset in a different attribute. Give major powers two assets in their primary attribute, and two assets in different attributes, and give regional hegemons four assets in their primary and four in others. Place these assets on the worlds occupied by the faction.

Select an appropriate faction tag for the organization, one fitting their special focus and origins. If the faction has direct governmental control over one or more worlds, add Planetary Government tags to them.

Finally, select a Goal for the faction. For your initial three or four sector factions, try to pick goals that will put them in conflict with each other. If the factions you make are content to hide from the world and get along in peace and quiet, they're unlikely to be terribly useful as patrons or enemies for the PC group, unless you intend to enlist the PCs as defenders of some beleaguered group of innocents.

### Creating PC Factions

Eventually, it's likely that a PC is going to accumulate the necessary power and influence to start their own faction. Often around 9th level, a PC has gained enough renown and competence that others will want to serve them, and they can choose to parlay that into a faction of their own. This may happen at earlier levels, depending on whether or not the PC has made it a significant priority to develop their own faction.

Newly-founded factions are fragile, vulnerable things. They start with a score of 2 in their primary attribute and 1 in the others, 8 [hit points](#^faction-hit-point), and one asset in their primary attribute. The GM may select one faction tag appropriate to the new organization's nature.

The exact details of a PC's new faction will depend largely on what the character did to form it.

A PC who organizes a colonial expedition to an uninhabited world will end up with a faction very different from that of a PC that starts her own psychic academy. In general, PCs have to actively work to create their faction. It does not simply arrive as their natural birthright.

### Adventures and Factions

The actions of adventurers fall outside the faction turn, but the consequences of their escapades can translate into the loss or acquisition of FacCreds, assets, or faction [hit points](#^faction-hit-point). If the players come up with a scheme to strike at the leadership of the Brotherhood of the New Man, success or failure isn't determined according to Force attacks or Cunning defenses. Success is determined by the outcome of the adventure itself, and the group's ability to overcome the security and obfuscation that surrounds these mad gengineers.

The amount of damage done or benefit given to a faction by a group's adventures should be substantial, at least as much as could be accomplished with a faction turn. It may not be possible to bring down an interstellar empire by precision strikes and subversion, but the players should be able to see concrete effects from their successes. At the very least, the newslines at the end of each faction turn should include public commentary on the visible consequences of their actions.

Some players will want to take advantage of the resources of their factions in the course of their adventures, either bringing along troops or specialists, or utilizing faction assets on a personal level. This should be permitted as a general matter; there's not much fun in being a colonial governor if you can't even get a corporal's guard of bodyguards to look after you. Faction equipment should also be available in reasonable amounts. Subordinates are not adventurers, however, and while they will perform their duties diligently and well, they won't willingly take the kind of risks that adventurers often relish. Faction assets should be an advantage and a tool for the PCs rather than a crutch.

It may come up that a character wants to withdraw credits from his faction, or donate loot won in the course of their adventuring. FacCreds translate poorly into normal credits, as they often represent resources that don't liquidate easily into cash. The GM should feel free to prohibit directly withdrawing cash from a faction if a PC comes to rely on it too heavily. Otherwise, one FacCred will usually translate into about 100,000 credits worth of cash, with substantially larger returns if used to make investments, or build things.

Characters can give up to 1d4 x 100,000 credits to a faction in any one turn, with each 100,000 credits becoming 1 FacCred. Any more than this in one turn is wasted due to accounting inefficiency, and the faction will need to spend a full turn processing the donation before it becomes FacCreds.

### Example Factions

A GM doesn't always have time to sort out the details of every faction that might be needed. A group might decide to attack the planetary government of a world that wasn't important or interesting enough to merit the effort to define its governmental faction during sector creation, for example. The following sample factions can be pulled and used for such places as necessary. Where appropriate, you can add the Planetary Government tag for legitimate world governments.

#### Example Faction - Colony World

Thinly-populated worlds with limited infrastructure tend to have weak colonial governments concerned chiefly with issues of basic survival rather than expansion or intrigue.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 4, Cunning 3, Wealth 1
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 15
- ***Assets:*** Guerrilla Populace/Force 2 and Saboteurs/ Cunning 2
- ***Tags:*** Colonists

#### Example Faction - Lost World

Primitive and barbaric by the standards of the space going worlds, a lost world lacks the technical resources of their neighbors, but may well have substantial advantages in population and cultural cohesion depending on the world's habitability.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 4, Cunning 1, Wealth 3
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 15
- ***Assets:*** Zealots/Force 3, Harvesters/Wealth 1
- ***Tags:*** Savage

#### Example Faction - Backwater Planet

Perhaps this world was important once, but disaster, ennui, or the Scream has left it a sleepy planet disinterested in the wider galaxy. Most worlds with ordinary levels of technology in a sector will fit this template.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 6, Cunning 3, Wealth 5
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 29
- ***Assets:*** Postech Infantry/Force 4, Planetary Defenses/Force 6, Informers/Cunning 1, Bank/ Wealth 4
- ***Tags:*** Deep Rooted

#### Example Faction - Zealous Faith

This religious organization is a powerful force in the sector, likely with major congregations on several worlds.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 29
- ***Assets:*** Demagogue/Cunning 6, Organization Moles/Cunning 5, Zealots/Force 3, Marketers/Wealth 5
- ***Tags:*** Theocratic

#### Example Faction - Regional Hegemon

This world is the mightiest military power in the sector and leads a half-dozen neighboring worlds in a “voluntary confederation” that it ever seeks to expand.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 8, Cunning 5, Wealth 7
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 49
- ***Assets:*** Space Marines/Force 7, Planetary Defenses/ Force 6, Blockade Fleet/Force 5, Extended Theater/Force 4, Pretech Manufactory/Wealth 7, Shipping Combine/Wealth 4, Tripwire Cells/Cunning 4, Cyberninjas/Cunning 3
- ***Tags:*** Imperialists

#### Example Faction - Mercantile Combine

A star-spanning consortium of merchants might operate out of one particular world, but their final loyalty is always to their credit balance.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 5, Wealth 6
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 29
- ***Assets:*** Venture Capital/Wealth 6, Shipping Combine/Wealth 4, Hardened Personnel/Forces 2, Blackmail/Cunning 2
- ***Tags:*** Plutocratic

#### Example Faction - Eugenics Cult

Some people are born to rule- literally. These eugenics cults believe that superior breeds of humanity can be successfully engineered, and that good genetic background legitimizes rule over less “advanced” humans.

Such cults are widely loathed, but the experimental medical treatment they offer to those who can find them makes unwilling converts of some.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 29
- ***Assets:*** Boltholes/Cunning 5, Demagogue/Cunning 6, Laboratory/Wealth 3, Gengineered Slaves/Force 1
- ***Tags:*** Eugenics Cult

#### Example Faction - Rebel Freedom Fighters

Even in the most tyrannical corners of the galaxy, the human heart yearns for freedom. These factions spring up in the shadow of oppressive governments. For each one that is crushed, a new one rises in time.

- ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 4, Wealth 1
- ***[Hit Points:](#^faction-hit-point)*** 15
- ***Assets:*** Seditionists/Cunning 4, Zealots/Force 3
- ***Tags:*** Secretive


### An Example of Faction Play

The GM has just finished brewing up her initial sector. She has a rough sketch of the worlds, she's fleshed out the planet where the initial play session will occur, and she's ready to run the game. She thinks it'd be nice to have some background activity going on, so she plans to create three factions to decorate her world.

She picks out three groups that are likely to be significant players in this corner of her sector: the harsh planetary government of Typhon, the initial starting point for the game, the Rathskeller Combine, a multistellar megacorp based off the world of Danube in the neighboring solar system, and the Way of Voth, a pretech-worshiping cult with a hidden base on Singularity, a gas giant moon in a system neighboring both.

These aren't the only possible factions in the system, of course, but they're the ones most likely to be pertinent to PC interests. If the PCs move on, she might retire some of these factions to bring in new ones. She knows she shouldn't have more than a half-dozen factions active at once unless she's ready to do a lot of tracking during each faction turn.

She knows the Typhon government is a fairly powerful faction, having effective control of its home planet save for some plucky rebels against its autocratic monarchy. Force is its strongest tool, so she gives it a rating of 6 in that, followed by Wealth of 5 and Cunning of 3. Its maximum [hit points](#^faction-hit-point) are 29. As a major power, it has two Force assets and two more assets of any kind. Typhon would love to have Pretech Infantry and has the Force score to support it, but its tech level is 4, too low for such advanced troops. It settles for a Strike Fleet and some Postech Infantry. Aside from that, it has a government Monopoly on spike drive components and a Postech Industry that helps make them. It also has a Base of Influence on its home world of Typhon that automatically has 29 [hit points](#^faction-hit-point), the same as the faction itself. Finally, it has the faction tag of Planetary Government, because it's the legitimate ruler of Typhon.

For the Rathskeller Combine, the GM decides that it's about as powerful as the Typhon government due to its far-flung mercantile connections. On reflection, she thinks its main money comes from its control of the ship-building industry outside the Typhon system, which makes it an economic competitor with the state-run Typhon shipyards. She gives it a Wealth rating of 6, Force of 5, and Cunning of 3, with a maximum HP of 29. Since it's starship-centric, she gives it Shipping Combine and Blockade Runner assets for Wealth, and other assets of Elite Skirmishers and Saboteurs. The Plutocratic tag fits its mercantile origins.

For the final faction, the GM decides to make them a relatively weak group, one that tries to use its limited supplies of pretech artifacts to manipulate “less developed” societies. She gives it a Cunning score of 4, a Wealth of 3, and a Force of 1. Its maximum hit points are 15. It gets only two assets as a minor power, so goes with Cyberninjas and Covert Shipping to get those ninjas where they need to go. The GM mulls over the faction tags, but none seem to be quite right. She decides to give it her own tag of “Pretech Stores”, letting it treat Singularity as a tech level 5 world for purposes of buying high-tech assets there. While there's no other meaningful authority on the gas giant moon, the GM doesn't think it's proper to give them the Planetary Government tag because there really isn't anything else *on* Singularity except the Vothite base. They don't have the implicit military power to prevent hostile military assets from landing on the world, so they don't really fit the mold of the Planetary Government tag.

The last step in creating the factions is to give each of them an initial goal. She decides that the Rathskeller Combine is really interested in breaking into Typhon's closed market. She gives it the *Expand Influence* goal, which rewards it when it can found a Base of Influence on another planet. Typhon is a violent, expansionistic power that goes in for *Blood the Enemy*, so it seeks to inflict hit point damage on rival assets equal to the sum of its attributes, or 14 points. The Vothites know they can't survive a direct confrontation with either important power, so they want to get ready to make a move when they're stronger; they choose *Peaceable Kingdom*, needing to spend four consecutive turns without taking an *Attack* action.

With this established, the GM is ready to run the first faction turn.

#### Turn One

The GM randomly selects the Rathskeller Combine to go first, followed by Typhon, and then the Vothites.

First, the Combine earns its income for the turn; half its Wealth plus a quarter of its total Force and Cunning, rounded down. That means 5 FacCreds.

Next, it pays maintenance. It has no assets that require maintenance and hasn't got more assets of any one type than its corresponding attribute, so it has no maintenance cost. If it were to accumulate four Cunning assets, however, while only having a Cunning of 3, it would have to pay one FacCred for each over the limit. Bases of Influence don't count for this purpose.

Now the Combine has to decide what action to take. It knows that Typhon is itching for a fight. The Combine is nervous about their rival's Strike Fleet, but that seems to be the only force that immediately threatens them. The Postech Infantry that Typhon has doesn't have any practical way to cross into Danubian space unless Typhon buys some sort of transport asset. Right now there seems no way for the Typhonians to do that, so the Combine decides to go for a long economic game, taking the *Buy Asset* action to spend 2 FacCreds on Harvesters. The GM decides that this represents a new flotilla of asteroid mining tugs. A faction can buy only one asset per turn and can take only one action, so the Combine's turn is over.

Typhon isn't wasting any time. It gets its FacCred income for the turn of 4 FacCreds and uses its action to *Use Asset Ability* to let its Strike Fleet enter the Danube system. Some assets require governmental permission to move them into a system with an existing government, but not Strike Fleets. They tend to make their own permission. Typhon would like to start attacking Combine assets, but it can only take one action per turn, so it will have to wait until the next one to open fire.

The Vothites are keeping their head down, accruing their 2 FacCreds. As poor as they are, they need to do something about it, so they invest in a *Buy Asset* action to get a Harvester. The GM decides that it represents scavenger teams dispatched to loot vital resources from the dangerous pretech caches hidden on Singularity.

As the final step, the GM translates these faction actions into newsfeed stories to share with the PCs. She scribbles up short news blasts about “Typhon First Fleet Dispatched to Suppress Piracy in the Danube System”, “Rathskeller Combine Commissions New Wing of Asteroid Miners”, and “Unusual Ship Traffic In Singularity System”. These stories may not have the whole truth about affairs, but they're what the PCs would find out from the local news organizations.

#### Turn Two

The PCs completed their first adventure and are busy swanning around in the Danube system. Nothing they've done directly impinges on the local factions, so the GM simply runs the next faction turn after the session is over. Random rolls give Voth the first action, then Typhon, and then the Combine.

Voth gets another 2 FacCreds and dutifully uses *Buy Asset* to get another Harvester, scaling up their salvage efforts. This makes two Wealth assets that Voth has; it can get one more Wealth asset before it starts to have to pay maintenance on any additional ones. They would've liked to have used *Use An Asset* to see if their existing Harvester made them any money, but they can't take two different actions during the same turn, so they must wait for now.

Typhon now collects its 4 FacCreds, for a total of 8, and uses the *Attack* action. If it had multiple assets in position, it could attack with all of them; as it stands, only the Strike Fleet is in the same location as a rival power. It aims at the Base of Influence, but the Combine gets to decide which asset the Strike Fleet engages. It chooses to defend with its Blockade Runners. The Strike Fleet's Attack is Force versus Force, so Typhon rolls 1d10 and adds its Force rating for a score of 11. Against this, the Combine rolls 1d10 and adds its own Force rating for a score of 12. The Strike Fleet's attack has failed, and it takes the Counterattack damage of the Blockade Runners, for 2d4 damage, for 7 points. The Strike Fleet is now down to 1 hit point.

The Rathskeller Combine now senses an opportunity. They collect their income of 5 FacCreds for a total of 8 and take an Attack action of their own, ordering the Saboteurs to press the attack. The Strike Fleet is the only viable target in the sector, so Typhon is forced to defend with it. The Saboteurs' attack is Cunning versus Cunning. The Combine rolls an 8, a tepid result, while the Strike Fleet gets lucky and rolls a 9. The Saboteurs are forced to take the Strike Fleet's counterattack damage of 1d8, and roll a 6; they are wiped out. Stung, the Combine throws the Elite Skirmishers into the fray, the only other asset they have that even has an attack. They roll a Force vs. Force attack, Typhon rolls badly, and the Strike Fleet is destroyed.

The GM then writes up the news blasts for the session, describing how “pirate” boarding parties destroyed the Typhonian strike fleet by taking advantage of security breaches caused by recently-discovered saboteurs. She decides that both Danube and Typhon want to avoid outright war, and that Danube's planetary government won't get involved so long as Typhon is only cutting down Combine holdings.

#### Turn Three

As it turns out, the PCs took notice of that news item about Singularity's ship activity and decided to investigate. In the course of their adventure they killed a Vothite salvage crew and snatched away a precious haul of pretech artifacts that the crew had been recovering. The GM decides that this costs the Vothites one of their two Harvester assets. There is no die roll or faction action related to this; the PCs did it, so it simply happens. They also left plenty of evidence, so the GM makes a note to have a Vothite cyberninja come after them and their stolen artifacts. Such small-scale actions related to PC adventures don't require a full faction action, so the Vothites don't need to use an Attack action to go after the troublesome PCs.

The Vothites go first this round and are not amused. They collect their 2 FacCreds and Use An Ability to see if their remaining Harvester makes them any money; they roll a 4 on its ability and gain an extra FacCred, for a total of 3 in its coffers this turn.

Typhon goes next, collecting 4 FacCreds for a total of 12. It's licking its wounds, but at least it managed to inflict 6 of the necessary 14 points of damage on a foe to succeed at its *Blood the Enemy* goal. It uses *Buy Asset* to buy a new Strike Fleet, reconstituting it from the survivors and spending all 12 FacCreds on it.

The Combine goes last, and is at a crossroads. Their income this turn gives them 13 FacCreds and they've successfully destroyed a Typhionian Strike Fleet, but it cost them their Saboteurs, and they have only one asset left that can even attack at all. What should they do to address the Typhonian menace? Maybe some PC mercenaries might tip the scales for them&hellip;

# GAME MASTER RESOURCES

The following pages include a number of tables for the quick generation of NPCs, patrons, names, place names, and quick encounters. The tables are in no way intended to be exhaustive or particularly detailed. They are simply quick conveniences for the GM to spare constant reference to the internet or other books to nail down the basic flavoring of their NPCs.

Aside from these tables, this section also discusses some of the more common issues that arise for GMs of ***Stars Without Number***. PC death, the role of combat, when to use skill checks, how to handle investigations, and other potentially sticky elements are reviewed and advice given for the practical handling of these matters.

In addition, this chapter gives some guidelines on converting material from the first edition of the game to the current revised rules. A selection of potential house rules are also suggested for groups that wish to customize their game a little more.

When applying any of these guidelines or suggestions, however, it is important that you remember a critical thing about running the game at your table.

## Your Game and Your Group

The most important thing you can remember as a GM running ***Stars Without Number*** is that you are running it for a *specific group of people*. You are not running it for a generic Typical Gamer, you are running it for Bob and Eunice and Feng and Tyler. There is no genericized advice that can be applied to your specific group that is nearly as helpful as your own powers of social expertise and your personal knowledge of the table.

Game designers sometimes fall into the trap of trying to force social outcomes at the table through specific game rules. These rules can encourage certain outcomes in the general case, but they cannot compel results. They are certainly not nearly as effective in producing an outcome as you, the GM, can be, because these rules can't know your players as well as you do.

Whenever you consider making a house rule, or adding a tweak to the game, or even basic considerations of what kind of sandbox excitement you should be offering to your players, you must always think about the specific players you have. Don't worry about the Typical Gamer. The Typical Gamer is not at your table. If Bob really wants a new focus that allows his PC to do a particular trick, you do not need to think of all the ways a Typical Gamer could abuse or misuse that new power. You need to think of the ways *Bob* could misuse it. Maybe he is the kind of gamer who would be very disruptive to the game with the ability, and maybe you know how he plays well enough to tell that he'd never cause a problem with it. The same ability that would be absolutely terrible in the hands of some players can be perfectly safe in the hands of others. Only you can reasonably tell which is which.

The same general attitude is necessary towards other elements of your campaign, not just the house rules. You need to think about how your specific players are likely to react to plot hooks, campaign elements, and new additions to the game. If you know Eunice was bored out of her mind by an adventure session that revolved around trading, it's probably a bad idea to offer her hooks that focus on commercial dealings, or at least talk it over with her outside the game before you introduce it to make sure there's something about the hook that she can find engaging.

As the GM, you already have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders. You have the adventures to create, the sandbox to populate, and the game itself to run. It is very unlikely that you have the energy or the time to worry about creating universally-functional house rules and generalized systems. That is the game designer's job. It's up to me to give you general rules that will work well in most situations and provide serviceable results with the Typical Gamer. That kind of averaged-out design is necessary if you're to be provided with a basic toolbox of useful mechanics and systems.

But you can do better, because you know your audience. You know what they want, what they're interested in, and how they're likely to use the tools you hand them. You can create specific house rules and case-by-case permissions that mold your game to fit the needs and interests of your own table.

***Stars Without Number*** is designed in the spirit of oldschool gaming, where these sort of house rules and campaign-specific systems are totally acceptable and perfectly normal. This game is not a delicate flower that will wilt if you touch it the wrong way. It is built on a basic mechanical chassis more than forty years old, a veritable AK-47 of game design, and it can take an incredible amount of punishment and careless handling without breaking. You will not ruin your game by adding in house rules that make sense to you.

This game belongs to you and your players. As the designer, I only get a vote in how things should be; the ultimate decision is always with you and your play group. Only you properly understand the goals of your group and the kind of fun you want to have, and only you and your players can provide the definitive understanding of your ultimate aim. I am providing you with a basic structure that will work for most groups, but it's up to you to add the chrome or tweaks that you want.

Perhaps you won't need to add any. It may well be that the rules exactly as written serve your purpose just fine, and you have no particular desire to tweak them. If that's the case, then that's fine. But you should never be afraid to reach in and adjust things to improve your own play. Add systems from other old-school-inspired games, brew up your own rules, or excise bits that don't fit. This game is yours, and you should play it *your* way.

## Common Game Master Complications

Once you've successfully created your sector and gathered the players, you might find a few difficulties cropping up in the course of play. There are certain pitfalls and complications that are particular to the style of play that ***Stars Without Number*** encourages, and it's helpful to have an idea beforehand of how to deal with them.

## Death

Characters in ***Stars Without Number*** die easily. The average third-level psychic might well be taken out by a lucky pistol round, and even high-level warriors don't have more than 60 or 70 [hit points](#^character-hit-points). It's true that biopsionics and lazarus patches can revive characters that get medical help in time, but there are plenty of situations where there's just not time to save a teammate or the attempt proves a failure. If the rules are used as written, PCs who regularly put themselves in dangerous situations are going to die.

You and your players should decide at the start of the game how you want to deal with this. For maximum old-school authenticity, you might mutually decide to just let the dice fall where they may. If Captain Spaulding plunges into the sulfur volcanoes of Badghati IV, the high-level veteran of dozens of daring interstellar escapades gets a touching space memorial and his player rolls up a replacement. This is the default assumption of the game, and it can add a great deal of excitement and reward to the sensation of navigating a character through lethal challenges.

It can also really aggravate players who enjoy building deeply-involved PCs with many close ties to the game world and its characters. A GM can decide to omit the risk of death in most cases, reducing PCs with 0 [hit points](#^character-hit-points) to “gravely wounded” status and allowing them to be revived with medical attention. Some situations might run the risk of real death, but the GM can save this for occasions of genuine dramatic importance. There's nothing at all wrong with this approach to death, and it can help some players focus on the story that they and their group are creating rather than living in fear of every goon with a combat rifle.

Of course, there are shades of gray between these two extremes, and most GMs come to inhabit some point on this spectrum. There are many ways the GM can lessen the risk of death without out-and-out denying it. In particular, the GM can cause enemies to spread their attacks over a group rather than focusing on the weakest PC. Hostiles can pay more attention to the warriors in the group rather than the experts or psychics, especially when the Warrior has yet to use his class ability to negate a hit. You can take care not to include instant-death traps or devices in your adventures, or fabricate situations where a character's life hinges on a single die roll. You can include substantial numbers of NPC henchmen and companions in an adventure, and let them soak up a portion of the danger. All of these tactics can be used to tacitly lessen the danger of character death without taking it off the table.

Sooner or later, however, it's likely that some PC is going to kick the bucket. At that point, it becomes necessary to get a replacement into the action. The replacement PC should be added as quickly as possible, and it can often be advantageous for players to roll up these replacements before the game even starts, so they have a character in hand should their former PC catch a bad case of laser poisoning. Creating the characters beforehand also allows the group to set up ties of association that help justify why they're suddenly willing to include the new PC in their adventures. These replacements can be members of the crew of the ship they're travelling on, outworlders slouching around the local bars, wanderers gone native among the locals, or prisoners of whatever nefarious group the party is fighting. The key factor is to get the replacement into action quickly, so the player who's lost his or her PC isn't punished with inactivity at the table as well as PC loss.

It's generally easiest to have the replacement PC be the same level as the dead PC. For high-level adventures, it's distressingly likely that a low-level PC would die quickly when facing challenges of that caliber. If they do come in at a lower level, you're going to have to make some allowances when it comes time for them to gain experience points. If everyone is gaining points at the same rate, the lower-level PC will never catch up; you may want to give them a bonus after each adventure to ensure that eventually they match the same level of competence as the rest of the crew.

## Skill Checks

Skill checks are susceptible to overuse. Some GMs end up forcing a skill check on everything more complicated than tying your bootlaces, or prohibit PCs from even hoping to accomplish a feat for which they lack the appropriate skill. Skill checks are not meant to be the sole way that a PC gets something accomplished in the world.

You should be charitable about the things a character can accomplish without a skill check. If an Expert's concept is that of a crack spaceship pilot with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and Pilot-2 skill, you shouldn't be expecting him to make skill checks to operate the ship under normal conditions. He can take off, he can land, he can get to places in the system without bothering with skill checks. Even someone with Pilot-0 should likely be able to do as much, except the expert pilot can do it without a check even amid high winds and low visibility. Let the PCs be good at their chosen focus.

Don't spam skill checks. If a character is trying to repair a fusion power plant while under fire from badlands raiders, don't turn it into a roll-each-turn extravaganza to determine how far he progresses in his attempt. Let him roll once, with a failure meaning either that he can't do it in the available time or that he'll need another 1d6 rounds before he can bring the defense laser power plant online. Give him player choices each turn, like deciding whether to bring a laser online early and risk a short in the wiring. Let a single skill check indicate the general course of success or failure, but then let the PC make additional choices rather than additional rolls. Rolls can only add so much tension, and tension alone does not guarantee engagement with a situation.

Don't require a skill check unless failing it means something. If a character can simply keep trying at something with no real negative consequences, it's not worth a skill check. They'll get it sooner or later, so it's easiest to just tell them that it was successful. If time is important and there's a significant difference between accomplishing it instantly or accomplishing it soon, just follow a failed skill check with a roll of 1d6 and assume that many rounds, minutes, or hours go by before the PC finally gets it right.

Don't ignore actions taken outside of skill checks. If a character jams a titanium wrecking bar into the cogs of an alien death trap, you probably shouldn't require him to make a successful Fix roll to disable the device. What he's done will objectively work, and there's no point or need in rolling for it. If there's a casket of luminous Mettauan glass underneath the senator's bed, then the players will find it if they look under the bed, and no Notice check is needed to see if they notice it. Skill checks are best used to reflect the results of a complicated or uncertain attempt at an action. If the PC tries something that anyone can do and that would have an obvious result, then just let the result happen. Don't use a skill check unless the outcome is unclear.

## Combat

Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** tends to be fairly lethal. One good roll by a pistol-wielding thug can take out almost any first level character, and characters never really scale to the point where they can afford to hold enemies in contempt. You should take care to structure your adventures and situations so that PCs are very rarely forced into fights. The shotguns and laser rifles should come out either because the PCs have chosen to use them or because they're facing the consequences of their own missteps.

Because combat is so dangerous, it's vital to allow the PCs to set it up on their own terms, assuming they're cunning and prudent enough to take advantage of their opportunities. Ambushes, AC bonuses for cover, and the use of the environment to hurt and baffle their foes should all be encouraged. If a character wants to use an element of the environment to do something interesting, let them. “You do that, and nothing happens.” is rarely a good answer for any halfway plausible PC action.

Enemies should also be played as their morale indicates. A pack of street thugs will not transform into Spartans at Thermopylae, dying to the last man to prevent the PCs from discovering their gang hideout. Even trained and disciplined combatants are going to have serious thoughts about retreat as soon as their comrades start dying. Only when enemies feel trapped or are defending something as precious to them as their lives will they normally fight to the last.

## Negotiation and Diplomacy

There is a Talk skill, and the fact that this and similar social skills exist sometimes causes players or GMs to simply shut off more informal evaluations of social situations. When the PC wants to convince an NPC of something, they roll Cha/Talk and let the dice tell them how far the NPC is willing to buy their premise. The actual words and arguments they use are simply decorations to the event.

On one level, this is justifiable. The player of the Warrior isn't expected to be a real-life shootist to roll a good attack roll, so why should the player of the silver-tongued Expert con man have to come up with a smooth line of patter to use his own abilities? It's legitimate and reasonable to let the dice determine the success of a conversational gambit. If a player has spent character resources on something like social skills, they should see a mechanical benefit from it. Moreover, relying on a player's conversational talents to move negotiations can often boil down to a game of finding the right conversational gambit for the GM rather than rationally persuading the NPC.

Still, some players and GMs prefer to let actual argumentation play a bigger role. One potential way to do this is to let the player state his or her case, and then set the Talk check difficulty accordingly. Convincing a crime boss to give a PC access to his network of corrupt city officials might be a difficulty 8 test if the player makes a good argument for it, while a desultory request might be difficulty 10. Alternately, you might implicitly adjust the consequences of success or failure based on the character's total Charisma and skill bonus. A character with a +5 total might not succeed in persuading the crime boss if they roll very low, but he'll point them towards someone who might be able to help them. The key for this sort of approach is to let both skills and player argumentation have a visible effect on the outcome, so that players feel that both matter.

In either case, you should make clear to the group which model will be used when they're making up their characters. It prevents difficulty later when the player running the character with a -1 Charisma modifier and no social skills expects his own glib tongue to carry the day with NPCs.

## Searching and Investigation

Many adventures rely on the party solving a mystery or unearthing the dark truths behind some enigmatic event. PCs can occasionally get frustrated by these adventures when they feel that they've hit a dead end or are presented with a set of clues that they, the players, can't hope to puzzle out. Conversely, players can sometimes grow bored when the adventures become a sequence of skill tests, with the PCs simply trying to roll high so that the GM will let them advance.

Running a good investigation-based adventure can be difficult, but there are a few tactics that can be useful to a GM. First, identify those pieces of information that must be found in order to solve the puzzle. Cracking the secret organlegging ring run out of the city's child protective services department might hinge on identifying the secret lab in which the organs are harvested, the corrupt CPS chief who hides the goods in her home, and the crooked physician who launders the organs into the donor system. These three facts have to be discovered in order for the PCs to progress.

Once you've established the facts, watch for opportunities to let them be discovered. Drawn in by the hook of a recurring urchin NPC they knew who vanished after being picked up by protective services, the PCs might check out the NPC's old haunts or associates, only to learn that a number of street kids have gone missing after CPS collected them, and that all of them were picked up by a particular agent. Don't make the discovery of vital information hinge on a die roll. If the PCs take rational investigative steps, they should be given something to show for it, even if it's just the confidence that their current route is a dead end. You should be *trying* to give out this information when the PCs give you an excuse to do so, rather than hoarding it against all but precisely correct lines of investigation.

You also shouldn't feel bad about giving PCs a break if they start to flail, either by introducing a helpful NPC to put them back on the trail or remind them of some earlier point they didn't fully investigate. By the same token, you shouldn't hesitate to let them deal with the consequences of tardiness. If they spend too long in distractions before finding their urchin friend, they might discover nothing more than spare parts.

One particular point that often comes up is the question of searching an area. Some GMs just let the PCs all make Notice checks to see if they notice something hidden. This has the advantage of being quick and simple, but it also can put vital information at the mercy of good dice. Other GMs require the players to specifically say what parts of an area they're searching, what they're looking under or inside, and otherwise describe the specifics of their search. This can penalize players who don't correctly envision the area the GM is describing. One compromise is to simply give players vital clues when they say that they are searching, and then use one or both of the other methods to let them search for supplementary facts and helpful details.

## Salvage

The far future is full of expensive decor. Truly enterprising PCs sometimes are of a mind to “salvage” a place down to its foundations, ripping out everything that can be resold and trucking it all off to be converted into credits. To some extent, this is simply common sense; no red-blooded freebooter would simply leave unclaimed valuables lying around when he knows they'll fetch a good price at the starport. Still, it can be tedious to handle the logistics of salvage and unbalancing to the game to allow PCs to cash in on every alien fork and wall panel they can drag back to civilization.

The easiest way to deal with this is to simply make clear that most non-portable valuables the PCs might salvage are just too difficult to move on the secondary market. Questions of legal ownership, finding a suitably indiscriminate buyer, and avoiding tax scrutiny all combine to make such efforts more trouble than they're worth. It can be interesting to make an adventure out of moving some particularly exceptional piece of salvage, but as a general rule, it's just not worth it to strip the copper wiring out of a crime boss' hideout.

There is also the issue of PCs methodically stripping the armor, weapons, and pocket change from their dead foes. In most cases this is self-limiting, as most PCs can't easily pack around a half-dozen combat rifles while engaged in the kind of pursuits that leave them fighting their former owners. In the unlikely case that the PCs come back with a cargo sled, most of the armor is probably worthless due to the perforations that killed its wearer and the weaponry is unlikely to be so valuable as to unbalance the game. Even in that case, moving the weapons on the black market is usually not a trivial enterprise. You shouldn't discourage PCs from upgrading their own equipment from the plunder of the fallen or taking exceptionally valuable pieces for later fencing, but you shouldn't feel obligated to let them decamp with the battlefield on their backs.

The actual mechanics of selling plunder can be as complicated as you wish to make them. It may be that what the PCs retrieve can be sold openly on the world, usually for around half its purchase value if a quick sale is desired. Something closer to full price can only be obtained with the sort of patience, contacts, and attention that adventurers rarely have avaialble.

A fence might be needed for those goods which were acquired in illicit fashion, or items that are outlawed for common trade. Fences rarely pay more than ten or twenty percent of an item's purchase price. Many such difficulties can be removed by taking the loot offworld and laundering it somewhere beyond the reach of the planet's laws.

## Interstellar Trade

As an extension of this, some groups will want to make a killing in interstellar trade, carrying the goods of one world to another to make a fast credit. This is a venerable science-fiction trope, and there's no reason you shouldn't allow it, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind when dealing with space commerce.

Perhaps most importantly, there is no such thing as interstellar bulk shipping in ***Stars Without Number***. Even the largest spike drive ships have cargo capacities measured in a few tens of thousands of tons, while a modern oil tanker has a capacity of around 500,000 tons. Trying to run a meaningful trade in bulk commodities has been a lost cause ever since the jump gates failed and massive system-ship freighters could no longer make the jump between worlds. Such commerce can exist inside a system, with huge slowboats moving from planet to planet, but modern trade relies on carrying small loads of high-value goods or expert services.

Most small merchant ships such as the ones a PC group is likely to own rely on in-system supply runs as their bread and butter. They cart loads of food, water, replacement personnel, spare parts, and other life support supplies out to remote asteroid mines, research stations, and extraction plants. The pay is rarely much, but such supply run missions are excellent hooks for dropping a group into the middle of some disaster.

Trade beyond supply runs usually revolves around moving local specialty tech or products. Local art, exotic pharmaceuticals, high-quality technical specialties, or passengers with special skills who want to reach a particular world all make up this class of trade. For most purposes, it's not necessary to really elaborate on the specifics of this, though it can add flavor to make up a product or two unique to a given world.

There are also exceptionally risky trading expeditions to lostworlders, bringing the fruits of modern postech to their benighted nations. While the weaponry, pharmaceuticals, and technical artifacts are usually greedily desired on these worlds, the natives often have very little of value to pay for them. Explorer-merchants often have to investigate a lostworlder culture carefully before they can identify any particular product or resource that can be usefully shipped interstellar distances to justify the trip. Some particularly unscrupulous merchants do not balk at taking payment in local slaves for export to decadent or dangerous worlds.

There are also “missionary” supply runs to these primitive worlds. The Preceptors of the Great Archive occasionally run missions on a planet to disseminate valuable technical and artistic knowledge among the locals, and there are always a selection of determined missionaries bent on bringing the word of their faith to the heathens. While these missions normally can supply their own food, offworld medicine and spares are vital for keeping their more advanced tech operating.

More sinister than the Preceptors and the pious are the “Kurtzes”. The prospect of ruling like a god on some forgotten world lures a certain type of men and women, a type that might normally be forced to limit their dark ambitions on a more technically advanced world, where energy weapons and powered armor do not give a person so vast an advantage over their peers. These Kurtzes seek out lost worlds with other like-minded men and women, usually framing their ambitions as a matter of “bringing advancement to the primitives”. Most Kurtz expeditions collapse in blood and horror within a few years, but some manage to hold on for far longer.

## Quick Trade Rules

For those who prefer not to use the full-fledged rules for interstellar trade provided in the ***Suns of Gold*** supplement, here are a few quick guidelines for responding to player interest in interstellar trade. They assume the PCs have a ship, but are just scrounging for marginal shipments and fast opportunities rather than taking advantage of a formal trade network and steady, reliable work contracts.

First, let the PCs find a deal for some good that the planet might reasonably produce. Cheap bulk goods would run for 2d6 x 10 credits per ton, ordinary finished goods go for 2d6 x 100 credits per ton, and high-tech, expensive products are 2d6 x 1,000 credits per ton. They can find a new deal with a week's wait.

PCs can try to improve the purchase price with a Cha/Trade skill check opposed by the seller's Wis/Trade skill roll. On a success, the price decreases by 10% times the level of Trade skill the bargainer has. On a failure, the price remains firm.

Before the goods are loaded, roll 1d6. If the PCs tried to get a better price, subtract 1 from the roll. If the result is 1 or less, something has gone wrong and the goods are lost, stolen, confiscated, or fake. The PCs are going to have to either eat the loss or take whatever adventurous steps are necessary to get their money or goods back. These steps may involve gunfire.

When the PCs try to sell the goods, assuming the planet might reasonably want them, roll 2d6+1 and multiply it by 10 for bulk goods, 100 for finished manufactures, or 1,000 for expensive goods. This is the base price the buyer offers to the PCs. They can bargain for better with the same opposed check as before, gaining a 10% price increase per Trade skill level on a success. On a failure, the PCs have to accept the offered price.

After the sale is finalized, the 1d6 needs to be rolled again, also with a -1 penalty if a better price was sought. On a result of 1 or less, the sale end of things goes awry, and the PCs are out both money and goods. To salvage them, they'll need to conduct some sort of adventure revolving around reclaiming their rightful due.

## Converting First Edition Stars Without Number

Most of this edition's content can be used interchangeably with first edition ***Stars Without Number***. Characters may be created somewhat differently, starships might handle combat in a new way, and psionics might have changed, but the end result largely uses the same statistics and same score ranges. An original-edition ***Stars Without Number*** character can adventure in a revised-edition campaign without requiring much in the way of special rules.

Some GMs will want guidelines on converting an existing original-edition game to the current edition. This is a simple process, as the scales are the same.

### Converting Characters

Characters have the same attributes, character level, and all other scores unless specified otherwise. Skills are converted directly into the closest equivalent; Combat/Projectile becomes Shoot, and so forth. In the case of multiple skills now compressed into a single skill, like a PC with both Combat/Projectile and Combat/Energy, the highest skill is converted and the lower skills can be exchanged for any other skills of the same level of the player's choice.

PCs retain their class. [Hit points](#^character-hit-points) are re-rolled for the character based on their revised-edition hit die. Thus, a 5th level Psychic can reroll 5d6 for their [hit points](#^character-hit-points). PCs may keep their existing hit point totals if the new roll is lower.

PCs may pick a number of foci appropriate to their class and level. If converting a 2nd level Warrior, for example, the PC could pick their initial focus, their bonus Warrior focus, and the focus they get at second level. If they pick foci that grant bonus skills, apply the bonus as 3 additional skill points to the skill as described [A Summary of Character Creation](#A%20Summary%20of%20Character%20Creation).

PC experience points are pro-rated based on the campaign. If the character was halfway to 7th level in the existing campaign, place their experience points halfway to 7th level under the revised rules.

Attack bonuses and Armor Class are calculated using the new rules, as are saving throw scores.

### Converting Psionics

The rules above are sufficient for converting most PCs, but the powers of Psychic PCs are a bit trickier.

To get the PC's psychic skill ratings, take their primary discipline, halve it, and round it up. Take their other disciplines, halve them, and round down. Thus, a PC with a primary Telepathy discpline of 9 and secondary disciplines of Metapsionics 7 and Biopsionics 2 would be converted to Telepathy-5, Metapsionics-3 and Biopsionics-1. For disciplines above level-0, they can pick a free technique from each skill level they know, plus one additional technique for each discipline from any level they know.

Calculate Effort normally.

### Converting Creatures

Flip Armor Classes to ascending values by subtracting the creature's AC from 20. No other changes are needed; existing attack bonuses, hit dice, saving throws, and so forth can be used as written.

### Converting Ships

Give NPC ships an appropriate number of Command Points to use each round in ship combat. Civilian ships and fighters should have 4 CP, military ships and experienced pirates should have 5 CP, and higher scores should be reserved for elite or spacer-native crews.

Adjust the ship's maintenance cost based on the new six-month maintenance schedule.

Ship statistics such as [hit points](#^starship-hit-points), [speed](#^starship-speed), [Power](#^starship-power), [Mass](#^starship-mass), and other attributes are generally the same in both editions. If the PCs build a new ship you can check it against the numbers, but existing ships can be left unchanged during use.

### Converting Equipment

Most equipment and weaponry can be used unchanged, as they're the same in both editions. You may need to use the revised edition version of a particular suit of armor or treat a monoblade as a medium advanced weapon rather than a unique type of armament, but no real conversion is needed.

For melee weapons, give it the appropriate Shock rating for its size. Small weapons have Shock scores of 1/AC 15, medium weapons have scores of 2/13 AC, and large weapons have scores of 2/15 AC.

For gear that forces a saving throw on a target, simply have the victim make whichever saving throw seems most appropriate to the item's effect. In case of Luck saves, substitute Mental saves or a pure blind chance of 50% success.

### Using Existing Sourcebooks

Existing ***Stars Without Number*** sourcebooks such as ***Suns of Gold***, ***Skyward Steel***, ***Starvation Cheap***, and ***Darkness Visible*** can be used with few or no changes. Most of the resources in these books were designed to be used in a system-agnostic fashion, and the agency construction rules in ***Darkness Visible*** or the interstellar trade rules in ***Suns of Gold*** can be employed without altering anything.

In a few cases, these sourcebooks may call for checks from skills that have been changed in the revised edition. Simply use the new version's skill in such cases; if ***Suns of Gold*** tells you to add a PC's Business score to some total, just add their Trade score instead.

## House Rules and the Game

***Stars Without Number*** derives from an old-school gaming tradition where house rules were almost universal. The basic chassis of the game is simple enough and rugged enough to handle all kinds of tweaks and adjustments without collapsing, and it is your sacred and inalienable right to bend the game in any direction you wish if it improves your fun.

You are encouraged to try the rules as-written at first, though, so you can be sure that you really do want to change something. If you do decide to shuffle things around, here are some possible house rules you could adopt, and some suggestions about their effects.

- ***No Shock Damage:*** Weapons do not do Shock damage. This can simplify melee combat at the cost of discouraging PCs from choosing to use melee weapons and increasing the “whiff” factor with them. If you drop Shock damage, you might also choose to drop the [*Snap Attack*](#*Snap%20Attack*) combat maneuver, as it's no longer necessary to give gunslingers a way to blaze down charging melee attackers before they get into range. ^house-rules-no-shock-damage

- ***Use Original Skill Lists:*** Like the skill list from the original edition of SWN better? Use it instead. When creating characters, allow skill picks or rolls to be converted to a corresponding original-edition skill. If the PC rolls “Shoot”, for example, let them pick Combat/ Gunnery, Combat/Projectile, or Combat/ Energy instead. When the existing rules call for a particular new skill, let the PC use any old skill that plausibly matches its function. ^house-rules-use-original-skill-list

- ***Don’t Use Command Points:*** Don't want to track Command Points in ship combat? Eliminate all actions that grant Command Points and just let each PC pick one action from their department list each turn. The captain's *Support Department* action now gives that department a bonus action, and the gunner now has a *Fire At A System* action that lets them fire one weapon at a targeted system at a -4 penalty to hit. NPC ships can either fire all weapons in a round or fire only one weapon and take one action relevant to their immediate needs. ^house-rules-no-command-points

- ***No Ranged Weapon Binding:*** One of the significant combat differences between the revised edition of the game and the original is the rule limiting the use of ranged weapons when a hostile melee combatant is adjacent. Some GMs will want to drop this rule for simplicity's sake, and that can work, but it may leave melee specialists feeling a little superfluous. ^house-rules-no-ranged-weapon-binding

- ***Use a Grid in Combat:*** While the game isn't written around the use of miniatures and a combat grid, GMs who want to go to the extra effort of making up such resources can do so. Using two-meter squares or hexes is likely to give the best results. ^house-rules-use-a-grid-in-combat

- ***Eliminate Psionics:*** Some GMs who want a more “hard sci-fi” game might choose to ditch psionics from the setting. In their absence, the Scream can simply have been an alien energy pulse that shattered the Jump Gates and left the worlds of humankind isolated for centuries. If you eliminate psychic PCs, however, you'll want to take care that the group has access to other healing resources, such as stims and trained PC medics. ^house-rules-eliminate-psionics

- ***Drop FTL Starflight:*** GMs who want to run a strictly one-solar-system game might eliminate FTL spaceflight as an option. The ***Engines of Babylon*** supplement for the original game discusses how to change the starship rules for a TL3 campaign that has edged into intra-system space flight. ^house-rules-drop-ftl-starflight

- ***Boost Starting Levels:*** The default campaign assumes that PCs will start at first level, as experienced but extremely mortal heroes. Groups that want to make room for a little more durability without using the heroic PC rules in the game's deluxe version might choose to start at third level instead of first, or give a flat 10 HP bonus to all PCs. ^house-rules-boost-starting-levels

- ***Add Universal Psionics:*** A GM might choose to run a campaign where every PC has some degree of psionic power. In such games, every PC should get the bonus of being a Partial Psychic as given under the Adventurer class. Adventurers who choose the Partial Psychic option should be treated as full Psychics, and the full Psychic class itself is dropped. ^house-rules-add-universal-psionics

  If using the space magic rules in the deluxe game version, the same method can be used to add universal magic abilities to PCs, either as partial Magisters, Adepts, or Arcanists.

- ***Use Plot Points:*** Some groups prefer to have a certain amount of narrative control given to the PCs, either to save them from otherwise-certain doom or allow them to make certain statements about the situation that are automatically true. Under such circumstances, you might give each PC two “plot points” that can be spent to save them when they would otherwise certainly perish, or else make an adjustment to the current adventuring situation that the GM judges amenable. Each time the PC advances a level, these plot points reset. Any unspent ones are lost. ^house-rules-use-plot-points

- ***Make Combat a Bloodbath:*** A few groups like to emphasize the abject horror and murderous danger of combat in their campaigns. For these groups, you can add the simple rule that every attack roll made on an even-numbered round of combat will automatically hit unless there's a penalty on the roll, whether due to cover or circumstances. In that case, the attack is rolled normally. PCs who get involved in combat thus know they have a very limited amount of time to resolve the situation. ^house-rules-make-combat-a-bloodbath

	## Name Generators

What's in a name? For most campaigns, a very great deal. Names and naming conventions are an important and useful tool for giving your worlds a sense of coherence and verisimilitude. It's all too easy to fall into the easy convention of nonsense-syllable names when a GM can get much more world-building mileage out of a more thoughtful use of language.

The names of people and places on a world should be in conformity with the local language. Every world is going to have its oddball names, but if the great majority of them share the same basic roots, it helps give the world a sense of cohesion and place. Even when the players have no knowledge whatsoever of the language or culture being used as a touchstone, using the same linguistic roots ensures that the same basic palette of sounds and word fragments will be used.

Note that language and culture are separable. Just because you've got a world flavored with Arabian-style architecture and kinship groupings, there's no reason you can't use French or Spanish for the language. A thousand-odd years in the far future, cultural transmutations unimaginable to us at present have taken place throughout human space. There no doubt exist centuries-old interstellar cultures that bear only a vague resemblance to their original forms. Take advantage of this to make your own life easier.

### Making Names Memorable

One difficulty that occasionally comes up at the table is a difficulty in remembering names that don't have any grounding in languages spoken by the players. Without any mnemonic hook or familiarity, one string of polysyllables tends to blur into another.

One way to get around this problem is to attach strong visual or character cues to individual NPCs. Players might not remember a particular spaceport hand's name, but they'll remember the guy who's constantly smoking a reeking cheroot, or the woman with fiber-optic laced hair. As the GM, you can help prevent forgetfulness by using the NPC's name regularly as well.

### Creating Alien Names

One quick trick for creating wholly alien names is to hunt up a very obscure language online and just use its words to name exotic entities and places. The players are unlikely to recognize Galatian or Gothic, so you spare yourself from carrying the implicit cultural baggage of the tongue, but the language still retains a characteristic set of sounds that will help maintain a coherent aural landscape. Further “palette swaps” of vowels, particular consonant clusters or the like can make an “alien language” out of almost any speech.

## One-Roll NPCs

There will be times when a GM needs an NPC on short notice. The preceding name generators can be used in conjunction with these tables to quickly produce a minor fill-in character for your adventure. Simply roll one of each type of die: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Match them to the tables, smooth over any rough joins, and you have your instant NPC.

When combat statistics are needed, just apply the most pertinent stat line from [Table - Common NPCs](#Table%20-%20Common%20NPCs) and assume they have whatever weaponry, armor, or other personal possessions might be appropriate for someone in their social circumstance.

## One-Roll Patrons

PCs often need patrons to aim them at adventures or offer suitable recompense for semi-legal favors. In conjunction with the adjacent one-roll NPC tables, you can use the tools below to quickly generate a patron and what it is they want from the party.

One particularly convenient technique is to have a few short filler adventures drawn up as described in [Creating Filler Adventures](#Creating%20Filler%20Adventures) and then when the players suddenly need a job or need a favor that only a cooperative patron could provide, use the patron to hook them up with the filler adventure. If you lack a convenient premade adventure, it's usually most practical to have the patron request some simple, direct, one-scene job that you feel comfortable in running on the fly. You can consult [Adventure Rewards](#Adventure%20Rewards) to find appropriate pay rates for different patrons.

## One-Roll Urban Encounters

There are inevitably times when a GM needs something to distract the PCs quickly. A quick encounter, whether in the urban jungles or the alien wastes, can buy a GM the time they need to puzzle out some larger problem. The tables here can be used to create a simple urban event to occupy the PCs for a little while.

The exact details of the event will have to be supplied by the GM in such a way as to fit the planet's culture and situation, but the goal of the tables is to provide a fast conflict that the PCs can interact with meaningfully. If the PCs resist the hook, it's a relatively simple matter to make the avoidance of it enough of a challenge that it buys you the time you needed in the first place. Don't force the PCs to engage with it, but let them work a little to get free.

## One-Roll Wilderness Encounters

Building appropriate wilderness encounters will vary greatly with the planet in question, but the tables below assume that the wilderness is on an inhabited world with some vague analogs to Terran terrain and vegetation. If the world is devoid of human inhabitants, replace the features with alien relics or the remnants of scouts or lost colonies.

The tables below provide a suggested time of day and initial distance for the encounter, but these baselines will vary depending on the choices and capabilities of the PCs. Some encounters are unlikely to occur at night, unless the parties involved are traveling or otherwise active despite the dark. Suggestions are given for likely-hostile and likely-friendly creatures, but a reaction roll will influence attitudes greatly.
