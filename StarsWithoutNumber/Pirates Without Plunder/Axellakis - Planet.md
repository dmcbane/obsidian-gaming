Axellakis is a large, agricultural planet that grows a wide variety of native foods plus many varieties which are purported to be transplants from Ancient Earth.

Axellakis was TL2 until roughly 100 years ago when native discoveries and contact with their system neighbors coincided to lift them to the stars. While they still have only limited space faring capabilities, they have grown rich through their agricultural exports.
