# Cross Parsec Corporation
## Organization

#organization #cygnusarc #pwp 

**Type:** Cygnus Arc Cartel Front Company  
**Public Role:** Labor Contracting & Personnel Services  
**Actual Role:** Slave Acquisition & Human Trafficking Operation  
**Legal Status:** Legitimate Corporate Charter (fraudulently obtained)

## Corporate Structure

Cross Parsec Corporation presents itself as a reputable labor contracting firm specializing in providing skilled workers for dangerous or remote assignments. They maintain all the trappings of a legitimate business - proper incorporation, tax filings, insurance policies, and regulatory compliance documentation. This facade has proven remarkably effective at providing legal cover for Cygnus Arc's slave acquisition operations.

The company operates under a valid corporate charter obtained through bribery, forged documentation, and exploitation of bureaucratic loopholes. Their "labor contracts" are technically legal documents that become instruments of enslavement through deceptive terms, coercive enforcement, and deliberate exploitation of workers with limited legal recourse.
