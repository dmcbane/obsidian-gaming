#npc #pwp #cygnusarc #blacksite #carrioncloak

Commander Torrino is the facility commander of Depot Helga, a [Cygnus Arc Cartel - Faction](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md) blacksite operation beneath [Helga - Moon](Helga%20-%20Moon.md). He oversees prisoner processing and evidence destruction for the Cartel's slavery operations.

### Background
A former corporate security director who transitioned into "enhanced interrogation" consulting after a hostile takeover destroyed his previous employer. Torrino built his reputation by delivering results while maintaining plausible deniability for his clients. The Cygnus Arc Cartel recruited him specifically for his expertise in making problems "disappear" completely.

His nickname "Cleanser" comes from his obsession with leaving no trace of operations - every prisoner processed, every piece of evidence destroyed, every witness silenced. He takes professional pride in running what he considers the sector's most efficient processing facility.
