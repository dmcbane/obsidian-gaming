# Meeting with Victor Stolypin

Each of you, [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md), [LJS](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md), and [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), received invitations to meet at the [Masters Shipwrights](Masters%20Shipwrights.md) facility where you originally met with [Madhav Gupta](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md). Upon arrival, you are transported via lift to the space station and escorted to a large conference room where you converse amongst yourselves as you wait to begin. You are joined by [Madhav](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md) and others who [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) recognize as heads of the [Maroni family](Maroni%20family.md). Eventually, you are also joined by [Viktor Stolypin](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) who steps to the head of the table and addresses the room in Mandate with a light Russian accent.

\"I've asked you all here to address a situation that impacts all of us,\" Inaudibly, \"more than you know.\" After a long pause, he continues. \"Before we get to that, I need to rectify an unfortunate mistake.\" He turns toward [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md). \"You want my life because of the death of your nephew. I would feel the same way if I were in your position. His death is on my hands and I have dealt with the one who made the mistake that led to his death. This is a debt that I owe you...\" and turning to [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) \"...and you. You see us as enemies fighting for warring families. This is a misconception that I have promoted. For us to work together, you need to know that your family has worked with me for some time.\" He turns and looks towards the heads of the [Maroni family](Maroni%20family.md) and nods. They nod in response. Addressing them he continues, \"Thank you for your time, but I don't want to keep you.\" As they stand to go, [Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) turns back to [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md). \"Once you have heard all that I have to say, if you feel I still owe you, we will settle it.\"

Turning towards [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [LJS](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md) he says, \"Your crew was killed because someone in my employment failed. I know that this is not enough, but I have taken care of a situation with your ship and cleaned up what we'll call a 'title discrepancy'. You won't have anymore problems from [MI](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md).\"

\"In addition, [Mr. Gupta](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md) and his team have done an exceptional job with your ship and it will be ready by the end of the day today.\" He turns to [Madhav](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md) and nods. [Madhav](Madhav%20Gupta%20-%20NPC.md) returns the nod and leaves the room.

Turning to his staff and security detail [Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) says, \"Gentlemen, can we have the room.\" Looking around the room while they depart, [Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) continues.

\"I brought you all here because I need your help and I...I...\", trailing off and looking around uncomfortably, he eventually composes himself and continues.

\"I run a multi-planetary corporation. I am the head of a,\" pausing slightly, \"family. I have people and resources to accomplish whatever I want and I yet find myself asking for your help.\"

\"[Papadoodoo](Papadoudou%20-%20Planet.md) is in danger not for the first time. Roughly a year ago, I was made aware of a situation that threatens the 3 billion inhabitants of [Papadoodoo](Papadoudou%20-%20Planet.md). Apparently, the core of our beloved planet has a flaw that will result in its eventual self-destruction if not regulated. According to the historical record, this flaw was discovered soon after the original survey of the planet, but it was judged to be insufficient to prevent colonization, so the efforts to establish an outpost here continued. The device used to stabilize the core must have been commonplace at the time of the writing of the records, because they mention it only in passing during the discussion of stabilizing the core prior to settlement. From what my sources tell me, these devices were expected to last almost indefinitely with only minor, periodic maintenance. I am told that the procedure is very well documented and is actually quite simple. That is until you run out of the supplies needed to perform the procedure.\"

\"The maintenance was last performed on the device about a century ago and, at that time, they noted that some of the supplies used in performing the procedure were potentially compromised. Subsequent investigations confirmed that the supplies were compromised and inadequate to perform the procedure. A search was initiated at that time to locate additional supplies or suitable substitutes. Most were easily located. In fact, all but one critical component were identified, sources documented, and sufficient quantities obtained to last for centuries. Unfortunately, that one critical [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) component has never been located and, without it, the maintenance procedure has not been successfully completed.\"

\"I am told that this maintenance procedure should be performed every 20 years or so to prevent the deterioration of the planetary core. As I mentioned before, it hasn't been fully completed in more than a century. The experts who have studied the situation tell me that the planet's core is deteriorating and that the seismic activity that we have noticed increasing over the last decade is due to this deterioration. They tell me that, at the current rate of decay, we have about 50 years before the planet becomes completely uninhabitable.\"

\"You're probably asking yourself, 'Why do I care?' 'This seems like a good time to get out of here and never come back.' Maybe, but I'm hoping that you aren't heartless, selfish bastards who would abandon 3 billion people to their fate while you run off to do...whatever. I need your help because your ship was used by the crew who discovered this little item which I believe you recognize."

[Viktor](Viktor%20Stolypin%20-%20NPC.md) holds up the [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) ring that [Eric](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md) acquired during his party.

\"Some of my people found this embedded in the front of the house where the bomb killed your crew members.\"

\"The team that discovered this device believed it to be the key to a [](STARS%20WITHOUT%20NUMBER,%20FREE%20EDITION#Pretech,%20Psitech,%20and%20the%20Gates|Pretech) vault. I hope they are right. I need this to lead to the component that will save my planet. The teams logs and several encrypted files are in your ship's computer, so at a minimum, I need access to the ship. I want more than the minimum; I want you to find the vault.\"

\"We are pursuing multiple avenues to save our planet, but finding the vault provides our most promising chance for success. Unfortunately, if I or my people start searching for a pretech vault, the word will spread and scavengers will flock to everything we touch. If anyone found out what we're trying to do, they might even hold the planet hostage. I can't take that chance. I need you to find that vault and I need you to make sure that you don't leave a trail that anyone can follow while you do it. Questions?\"

[Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) asks, \"With 3 billion lives on the line, I hate to even ask, but did the [MI](Motinovation%20Industries%20(MI).md) cleanup include anything that might help me with the situation with my brothers?\"

Viktor responds, \"Unfortunately, the scope of my direct influence is limited to the [Calia system](Calia%20-%20System.md). My people have been able to discover that your brothers are being held in the [Soonoror system](Soonoror%20-%20System.md) possibly on [Melis](Melis%20-%20Planet.md), maybe on [Martis](Martis%20-%20Planet.md). That is all we have. I'll notify you if we discover more. What else?\"
