## Summary of Last Session
We started the last session by stunning [Benny's](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) escort and sending him to the far side of the planet using the [Personnel Transport System](Nawzira%20Personnel%20Transport%20System.md) and [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) teleporting to [Emilio's](Emilio%20Alcazar%20-%20NPC.md) ship, "The Roxbury", for the initial exploration and then going back with [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) for deeper investigation.  Hacking into "The Roxbury's" computer, they discovered why "The Roxbury" was impounded, the location of the [The Christmas Ship, Merry Mariner,](Merry%20Mariner%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) and, eventually he discovered the location of [Nico Santero's](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) ship, "The Slay".  They also discovered [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) had scheduled a conference room to meet with someone named [Leroy Jones](Leroy%20Jones%20-%20NPC.md).

Going to "The Slay", they discovered [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) in a stasis chamber and revived him.  He immediately began bleeding from  stab wounds so they took him back to the Cambrian where [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) could heal him and keep him alive. Upon recovery, [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) told them about meeting with [Leroy Jones](Leroy%20Jones%20-%20NPC.md) to discuss the location of a PreTech Vault on [Nawzira - Planet](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md).  [Leroy](Leroy%20Jones%20-%20NPC.md) told [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) that he was mistaken, that it was an Exchange Consulate Escrow Vault just before he stabbed him and left him to die.

While [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) , [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), and [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) were exploring "The Roxbury" and "The Slay", [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) had teleported over to the [Merry Mariner](Merry%20Mariner%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md),  wiped out the merc team (part of [The Copperheads](The%20Copperheads.md)) that had been searching for the vault key. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) continued searching where the mercs were looking, expanded his search, and eventually found it just plugged into the data core in engineering. He brought [LJS](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md) over to do some hacking and they discovered the key was undetectable by the data core so while they had the key, they couldn't tell what was on it or what it was for. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) held on to it and they went back to the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md).

While poking around in the [Welcome Center Site](Welcome%20Center%20Site.md) computer, [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) discovered that he could move the logical boundary between the holding area and the impound area which has profound impact on security protocols.

[Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) wanted to check out the ship's but knew he wouldn't be able to at the In Processing node due to the murder investigations under way so he traveled to the Secondary In Processing node only to discover that the entire  [Welcome Center Site](Welcome%20Center%20Site.md) was in lockdown.  He eventually joined the others back at the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md).

Once everyone was back onboard the [Cambrian](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) and information shared, they suspected that [Leroy Jones](Leroy%20Jones%20-%20NPC.md) had taken [Nico's](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) compad with the location of the vault.  [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) was certain that he could rediscover the location as long as he had access to the [Welcome Center Site](Welcome%20Center%20Site.md) computer system, but the lock down was going to be a problem.  Previous experience led him to believe the lock down would last a week.

The team decided to try to use [PTS](Nawzira%20Personnel%20Transport%20System.md) to travel to another site and use their computer only to discover that the lock down allowed travel to the launch site but not from it.

That's where we wrapped up.at's where we ended the session.

## Concepts for this session

- The pattern that [Nico Santero - NPC](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) recognized as being a void in the grid and possibly being the location of a Pre-Tech Vault is actually an Escrow Vault but knowing where the vault is doesn't provide access.  The key actually must be inserted into the slot on one of the internal computer terminals (including the ones for the [Nawzira Personnel Transport System](Nawzira%20Personnel%20Transport%20System.md)) and then the complete internal map with the Escrow Vaults  (yes there are several) visible will be revealed.  Once they have this internal map, they can identify the entrances to the vaults and use the PTS to get to each vault.  Generate a table indicating which ones are damaged and non-functional, which one actually contains the info leading to the Pre-Tech Vault and any other categories we might want to locate.
- Create a monster that roams the tunnels that is immune to the cold and has escaped from one of the storage containers.

The art pieces in the vault
Here are some descriptions of futuristic sci-fi art pieces, categorized for clarity:

**I. Bio-Integrated & Organic Tech:**

1. **"Symbiosis":** A large-scale sculpture depicting a human figure seamlessly integrated with bioluminescent plant structures.  The plant life pulses with a gentle light, extending tendrils that intertwine with the human form, suggesting a harmonious relationship between technology and nature. The materials would be a mix of polished metal, resin, and potentially living, bioluminescent organisms in a controlled environment.

2. **"The Algorithmic Garden":** An installation featuring genetically modified plants that respond to sound and light, creating shifting patterns of color and form. The plants themselves are grown within a transparent, geometric structure that resembles a futuristic greenhouse.  The piece explores themes of controlled evolution and the blurring lines between organic and artificial life.

3. **"Neural Lace Tapestry":** A series of intricately woven tapestries depicting microscopic neural networks, glowing with soft light. The threads appear almost organic, interwoven with metallic fibers, reflecting the complex interconnectedness of the human mind and technology. The piece employs a combination of traditional weaving techniques with embedded LEDs and fiber optics.


**II. Cyberpunk & Dystopian Futures:**

4. **"Data Streams":** A kinetic sculpture featuring cascading streams of data represented by glowing, shimmering particles.  The particles move and shift, forming ephemeral patterns that evoke the constant flow of information in a hyper-connected world.  The materials would include LED strips, holographic projectors, and mirrored surfaces.

5. **"Chrome Tears":** A series of portraits depicting individuals with cybernetic enhancements, their faces reflecting a blend of technological advancement and emotional vulnerability.  The portraits are rendered in a hyper-realistic style, capturing the intricate detail of the cybernetic implants and the subtle expressions on the subjects' faces.

6. **"Neon Graveyard":** A mixed-media installation representing a desolate cityscape at night.  The scene is dominated by decaying skyscrapers illuminated by neon signs that cast an eerie glow. The artwork uses layers of acrylic paint, sculpted ruins, and flickering neon lights to create a sense of haunting beauty and urban decay.


**III. Space Exploration & Colonization:**

7. **"Cosmic Bloom":** A large-scale painting depicting a nebula exploding into a vibrant array of colors, with elements of a futuristic space station delicately placed within the celestial tapestry.  The painting uses rich, luminous colors and a sense of dynamic movement to capture the awe-inspiring scale of space.

8. **"Terraforming Mars":** A holographic projection that shows the gradual transformation of Mars from a barren planet to a lush, habitable world.  The projection uses advanced technology to create a three-dimensional landscape that viewers can explore, witnessing the effects of terraforming technology firsthand.

9. **"The Last Signal":** A sound installation composed of distorted radio waves and alien-sounding melodies.  The piece uses ambient sounds and subtle shifts in frequency to evoke the vastness of space and the potential for contact with extraterrestrial life.


**IV. Artificial Intelligence & Transhumanism:**

10. **"The Digital Soul":** A virtual reality experience that allows viewers to explore the inner workings of an artificial intelligence. The viewer navigates a complex, ever-shifting landscape of data streams and algorithms, gaining a glimpse into the consciousness of a machine.


These are just a few examples; the possibilities for futuristic sci-fi art are truly limitless.  The key is to consider the themes, technologies, and emotional responses that such art might evoke.


## What Actually Happened
Hamarabi is a ghora class free merchant

Graff 9 
Inspector Kyuuto Nikolaidis found the bodies 

Introducing Mike and Mike and Ethan.'s new characters who are. Ryker and. Whiat, respectively, more. details on those later.



We began with Wyatt, Ethan's character. He was part of the three [college kids](College%20Kids.md) who were in the white cold weather gear suits who jumped the fence to the holding area Attempting to steal the Mary Mariner. and take it back to. Graff 9. Anyway, they were caught and taken away by a security So we begin with Ethan being taken back to the security area at the back of the the I know what the damn thing is called. It is called the. staging area. Yes. The staging area node. So he was taken into the security area at the back of the staging area. Node. and he was locked into a room. And then the power went out and that was caused by the guy that stabbed Nico Senterra, whose name is totally escaping me right now. Uh, it was started with AJ. And I don't remember what the guy's name was. But anyway, the guy that stepped Nikosentera was cycling the power in an attempt to get into the. vault and. no one else knows that. That's why the power keeps cycling in this area. But that's what's going on. anyway. when the power cycled off, it didn't really matter that the door in this security area is exactly like the doors in the in processing node holding cells. It's locked from the inside and open from the outside Ah, so that it's part of their security protocol. But they also have safety protocols. And the safety protocols mandate that anyone can get can release someone from a cell in the event of danger. Well, anyway, you get the idea. The point is when the power went out, it didn't have any impact on anything. But it did make all the security personnel leave. the area to go try to investigate. And they told these kids to just stay in the cell. Well, it turns out that Ed can teleport. So Ed teleported out of his cell. Ah, came over and located in Wyatt in his cell and they departed leaving the third guy whose name is escaping me right now. But I will figure it out later. Um, they found their cold weather suits that they had um been wearing when they jumped the fence were stashed on a table just outside of their holding cells. So they grabbed their cold weather suits, put them back on, did not have a second thought for the other guy And I'll worry about his name later. They went out and went to the Mary Mariner during all the power loss chaos. And since it was sitting out on the pad in the holding area and not in the impound area, they were. just able to hook up a tractor to it. And pull it back to the lending pad. And because they were wearing the appropriate gear and no one was suspicious, they took the proper routes and And took it to the pad. And it was able to get clearance. from approach control. Well, departure control. Excuse me. He was able to get clearance. from departure control. And he launched an flew the merry Mariner back to the graph. 7 state. station. Deep space station where it had originated Um, he selected graph 7 and it's actually the reason that now zero was originally selected is because graph 7 is very near to zero. during this time I mean. their orbits are not. completely synchronous at some times. now zero in graph 7 are very far apart. But during this time it just so happens that they were nearby making it convenient to grab the mariner. Go stash it in holding area on 0 and then for them to get back to graph 7 to return it to its original origin point. That's a better way to say it

Next, we move to. Riker. mikes character. Riker was in AA vault like area underground. on Naziri because his dad had the. equivalent of a safety deposit box. stored on this on this planet And Ryker was trying to discover where his dad's research had been stashed. And some thing had led him to Naziri So he had come here and was. trying to locate it while he was in the vault. the person who was assisting him helped him unlock the safety deposit box. He was able to open it and look in and he found 4. black slabs. You know, highly secure data slabs. Um presumably containing his dad's information. But the power went out Um, they told Riker that he did not have to worry about anything like loss of air Um, or um. I know the word. What's the word? Uh m, what do you call it on board a ship Um, that lets you breathe and not freeze It is called fill this in later. I'm totally spacing and it'll pop into my head when I quit trying to think of it anyway. He didn't have to worry about any of that So he waited a bit. Power came back on. He was able to leave when he got ready to depart. He was looking for the. future equivalent of an Uber And when he started checking, they told him he was going to have to catch He was going to have to catch. a ship that the welcome center site was currently in lockdown and that he could either go to the landing pad of landing pad node of the welcome center site. Or he could go to the. secondary welcome center site land ing pad in depart from either one of those locations. He chose to leave from the uh landing landing pad lending. zone. That's the word I'm looking for. He chose to go to the lending zone. Node of the welcome center site and got there in time to find a ship that was about to depart. He was able to convince then to allow him on board. I think he paid like 20 credits or something to get on board and by coincidence it was the Mary Mariner and he was leaving with Ed and Wyatt.



The rest of the crew um, meaning um. PWP proper. um they lifted off from the landing zone of the welcome center site and. hopped over to the secondary landing zone correction The secondary welcome center lending zone node then they commit. They convinced the. two workers who towed the Cambrian off the side after it landed. They convinced them to come on board, knocked them out, narrowly screwing that up and getting caught they swipe their suits teleported over near the holding area at the secondary site, identified the hammer Robbie and pop back to the Cambrian change back out of the cold weather gear went into the secondary welcome center in processing area, just like normal Oh, and the reason that they did all this was so that they would have a justified reason for being in the in processing area and and so Nico went up to the desk and stood in line to request the release of the Hammer Robbie while Sal set in the way. ing area and heck in to the planetary computer network and then by the time he had gotten in Nico had finished requesting the hammerobi and sat down next to him and guided him through the process of identifying where the where the vault was. So they were able to reproduce. his steps in locating the vault on Naziri then they left and went back to the landing zone they tried several different plans like they tried possibly taking off in the. Cambrian and then teleporting over to the Hamarabi, except that the distance was too far. They weren't going to clear Atmo, so that wasn't going to work. And then they also thought about more or less doing a something. similar that we would do in shadow run which is do a remote control liftoff and you know just do a remote piloting of the hammerabi except that we didn't have anybody with pilot level 1. So they need to program 2 and pilot level 1 to pull that off and they had they had the program level two but they only had program or pilot level zero so they just couldn't pull it off they eventually decided they would fly up to graph 7 in. list the aid of another pilot come back down to bring them back down and then they would take off with the hemorrhage because the hemorrhobi is worth like 850,000 credits so they can just sell the ship have some money and now they also know where the vault is. So they took off and went to graph 7 when they arrived at graph 7 there was a lot of hullabaloo. That's a good way to say it going on at. the docs and. let's stop there and switch back to the Mary Mariner.

as the merry Mariner arrived. at graft 7 when. they started making a. approach apparently word got out very quickly because when they docked and opened the airlock report ers swept into the ship and. were asking them all kinds of questions and like that is totally not why it's thing he backed away. He was like you know that was he was overwhelmed and that was not him I. Ed initially didn't want to have anything to do with it but eventually he did come in he did eventually come around to saying you know what? take me to a bar by me a drink and I'll tell you the whole story and the reporters kept pushing and eventually he just got out to the he got out to the gangway or out past the gangway but got on the way while out there and started telling the story so that is. how well the reporters and everybody were out there being busily swamping Ed as he's starting to tell the story of how they recovered the Mary Mariner. That's the point when Wyatt and Ryker were able to sneak off the ship now actually before they left the ship the inspector whose name And we'll add that later the inspector came over. And wanted to know, um. how they had recovered the ship and what he was trying to identify. What was going. on the show. was stolen, how they recovered it. He wanted details. Well, Ryker, truthfully told him he was just a passenger and he didn't really know what was going on. And Ed not ed. Um, Wyatt. lied to the inspector and told him that the other guy who was with them was part of their party. The one that they had left in the security. station of the in processing or correction of the holding No correction of the staging area node. down on Naziri. Whatever that guy's name was. I'll fill that in later. He or Wyatt told the inspector that he was down in the ship and that he could tell him everything about it. And then Ryker and Wyatt snuck off the ship and were. in, you know. circuitously avoided the reporters. and where nearing the end of the pier. I'm going to call it the pier. I don't know what to call it on a space station Anyway, they were approaching the station when the inspector came out and started looking for people because he'd obviously discovered the bodies in the lower hold of the Mary Mariner The bodies that neither Ed nor Wyatt nor Ryker knew. were there. So they just. realized that something was going on and they felt like they needed to run. And so they were running away from the merry Mariner. pretty close to the exact same time. that the Cambrian had. docked at graph 7 and they were heading in the PWP was heading in looking for a pilot. So my intent for the next section. Next session is to have either Wyatt or actually probably have Riker. Over here that. um. Pwp is looking for a pilot. and For him to be able to go, since he is feeling like he has to go on the run and he's not really even sure why. but for him to volunteer. Oh, I'm. I'm a pilot. What do you need I'm a qualified pilot anyway. That's kind of the plan for the next time Ah, that's it.
