## Dr. Marcus Webb

#npc #pwp #ankanjuratri #corrupted #traitor

Dr. Marcus Webb is a research assistant working on [Ankanju Ratri - Planet](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md) who has been secretly providing information to [Cygnus Arc Cartel - Faction](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md) slavers. He trades knowledge about native habits, cave systems, and research operations in exchange for passage off-world and financial compensation.

### Background
Originally assigned to the Ankanju Ratri research project as a xenobiology specialist, Webb became increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of academic research and the primitive conditions on the oceanic world. When financial troubles back home (gambling debts and a messy divorce) left him desperate for credits, he was approached by Cartel recruiters posing as corporate talent scouts.

What started as selling harmless research data has escalated to actively assisting in the capture of native populations. Webb tells himself he's just providing scientific consultation, but he knows he's become complicit in slavery operations.

### Corruption Timeline
**Phase 1 - Initial Contact:**
- Approached by "corporate recruiters" offering consulting fees
- Asked for harmless research summaries and environmental data
- Payment of 5,000 credits established trust and dependency

**Phase 2 - Escalation:**
- Requests became more specific: native population centers, behavioral patterns
- Rationalized as "legitimate scientific collaboration"
- Payment increased to 10,000 credits per data package

**Phase 3 - Direct Complicity:**
- Asked to provide real-time intelligence during operations
- Realizes true nature of "research" but too deep to escape
- Promised 50,000 credits and transport off-world for final cooperation

### Psychological Profile
- **Rationalization:** "I'm just providing scientific data, not hurting anyone directly"
- **Denial:** Refuses to think about what happens to captured natives
- **Self-Pity:** Blames circumstances and other people for his choices
- **Greed:** Dreams of wealth and comfortable retirement
- **Cowardice:** Will betray anyone to save himself

### Current Dilemma
Webb knows the latest slaver operation will be massive and devastating to the native population, but he's in too deep to back out. He's terrified of both the Cartel (if he doesn't deliver) and potential discovery by his colleagues (if his betrayal is exposed).

He's been promised extraction during the chaos of the operation, but increasingly suspects the Cartel plans to eliminate him as a loose end once he's no longer useful.

### Equipment Details
- **Research Datapad:** Contains all his scientific notes plus encrypted Cartel communications
- **Bio-Scanner:** Can detect native life signs and physiological states
- **Translator:** Custom program for Ankanju Ratri language and gestures
- **Specimen Containers:** Could be used to transport sedatives or other substances
- **Emergency Kit:** Standard research survival gear

### Intelligence Value
**What He Knows:**
- Identity of Cartel contact (Nora Barker's real role)
- Timing and scale of upcoming slaver operation
- Which other researchers might be sympathetic to Cartel offers
- Location of most valuable research data and equipment
- Native population estimates and sanctuary locations

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- True scope of Cartel slavery operations beyond this planet
- Identity of higher-ranking Cartel members
- Other Cartel operations in different systems
- Long-term Cartel strategy for the region

### Relationships
- **Research Team:** Maintains facade of dedicated scientist
- **Native Population:** Some trust him due to his language skills
- **Cartel Handlers:** Terrified of disappointing them
- **Station Security:** Viewed as harmless academic, has minimal oversight
- **Family Back Home:** Estranged wife and creditors who drove him to desperation

### Potential Character Arcs
- **Redemption:** Horrified by the reality of slavery, turns against Cartel
- **Full Corruption:** Becomes willing Cartel operative and recruiter
- **Desperate Escape:** Tries to flee before operation, potentially helping PCs
- **Breakdown:** Psychological collapse when confronted with consequences
- **Martyrdom:** Sacrifices himself to warn natives or sabotage operation

### Vulnerabilities
