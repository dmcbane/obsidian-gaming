## Organization

#organization #cygnusarc #pwp 

**Type:** Elite Cygnus Arc Cartel Enforcement Unit  
**Role:** Cleanup, Evidence Destruction, Witness Elimination  
**Motto:** "Leave No Trace, Tell No Tales"

## Unit Overview

The Carrion Cloaks represent the Cygnus Arc Cartel's most professional and ruthless enforcement division. Unlike common pirates or thugs, these operatives function as corporate cleanup specialists who eliminate evidence, witnesses, and complications that threaten Cartel operations. Their name derives from their signature black cloaking devices and their role as "carrion birds" who arrive after battles to clean up the aftermath.

Originally formed from ex-military special forces and corporate security specialists, the Carrion Cloaks have evolved into a highly disciplined unit that operates with surgical precision. They are deployed when the Cartel needs problems to disappear completely - not just defeated, but erased from existence.
