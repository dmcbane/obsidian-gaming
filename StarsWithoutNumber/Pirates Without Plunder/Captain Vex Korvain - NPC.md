## NPC

#npc #cygnusarc #pwp 

**Role:** Cygnus Arc Cartel Fleet Commander  
**Ship:** M.V. Iron Hymn (Command Destroyer)  
**Reputation:** Ruthless enforcer with a veneer of corporate legitimacy

## Background

Captain Vex Korvain represents the new face of Cygnus Arc operations - professional, well-spoken, and utterly ruthless. A former corporate security director who transitioned into "private enforcement," Korvain has spent the last five years building the Cartel's reputation as a legitimate business enterprise while orchestrating some of their most brutal acquisition operations.

Unlike the stereotypical pirate captain, Korvain presents himself as a corporate executive conducting lawful business. His ships broadcast proper identification codes, his crews wear uniforms rather than pirate garb, and he speaks in the language of contracts, legal authority, and corporate compliance. This facade has proven remarkably effective at confusing local authorities and intimidating targets.
