# Into the Waiting Night

Welcome, reader, to ***Stars Without Number***, a science fiction
role-playing game. Within the pages of this book you will find all
that you require to forge mighty tales both of victory and bitter
defeat amid the silent stars above. You will fashion heroes fit for
this new age of exploration and rediscovery, men and women capable of
unearthing the lost wonders of humanity's fallen empire. The scattered
sectors of the old Terran Mandate have been out of communication for
centuries, and no one living can know all the strange wonders that
have been born in the Silence. Every fresh world is a new marvel to
discover, and the brave souls willing to repair the broken web of
contact can expect rich rewards for their efforts.

***Stars Without Number*** is not only a game of discovery,
however. There are adventures to be had in more familiar places as
well. New polities and young empires have sprung up in the centuries
since the collapse of the Terran Mandate, and they struggle with each
other as hotly as their technology and resources allow. The right hero
at the right time can shift the fate of worlds, and heroes willing to
fight for their beliefs can be the greatest resources a struggling
star nation possesses. There are adventures to be had in dealing with
the powers of a stellar sector, where men and women are needed to foil
the sinister plans of enemies and bring victory.


<a id="sidebar-a-word-to-newbies"></a>

## A Word to Newbies

If ***Stars Without Number*** is your first tabletop role-playing game,
you're a rare soul. Most of the readers of this book will already be
familiar with the hobby, but fear not; tabletop RPGs aren't hard to
understand.  Just think of them as a pencil-and-paper equivalent of a
computer RPG, with a “game master” or “GM” in place of the computer,
and 2-5 players playing “player character” avatars.

You'll need paper, pencils, and a set of polyhedral dice or a dice app
to play the game. You can get gaming dice online easily. When the book
tells you to roll “2d10+1”, for example, it means to roll two
ten-sided dice and add them together, then add one to the
result. “d100” means to roll two 10-sided dice and read them as ones
and tens.

Not every hero has a mind for high goals, however. Many desire nothing
more than freedom and the credits to enjoy it. Whether hauling cargo
to backwater worlds or selling their lasers to the highest bidder,
these mercenary adventurers go where the pay is good and the danger is
acceptable. Some have greater ideals than their next patron's pay,
while others have no devotion to anything but their own
interest. ***Stars Without Number*** has room for both kinds of heroes,
and tools to help a game master provide the adventures they require.

***Stars Without Number*** is above all a set of tools for players and
game masters bent on sci-fi adventure. While the setting is built to
provide a wide scope for daring deeds, the game is fundamentally meant
to be reshaped and refocused to suit your particular interests and
desires. Whether a gritty game of desperate mercenary gunmen in an
interstellar war zone or a dashing campaign of star-faring adventurers
in a space-operatic sector, the game is meant to fit the needs and
tone of your desired play.

***Stars Without Number*** belongs to the “old-school renaissance” trend
in gaming, and draws much of its mechanical inspiration from the
classic games of the seventies and the work of such authors as Gary
Gygax, Tom Moldvay, Zeb Cook, Marc Miller, and other luminaries of
those days. While many people now prefer different mechanical
frameworks for their play, these “old-school” rules are understood by
a tremendous number of gamers and form a convenient *lingua franca*
between many different OSR games. These games are usually broadly
compatible with each other, and allow players to loot material from
many different authors and time periods with limited effort at
conversion.

This game is also designed to be a “sandbox game”, one built to ease
the creation of active, living campaign worlds where the PCs aren't
the only important figures, and where a hero doesn't necessarily have
any narrative armor against failure and death. While it can certainly
be played in a more conventional adventure path or story-arc manner,
***Stars Without Number*** is stocked with a wide range of tools,
techniques, and guidelines for easing sandbox play. The surprise and
freshness inherent in a good sandbox game can be a refreshing change
of pace for many groups, and in this book you'll find what you need to
play in that style.

The book you hold in hand right now is the revised edition of the
original 2010 version of the game. In compiling the revision, I have
been careful to keep it compatible with the existing material for the
game, so you should be able to use original edition supplements with
minimal fuss. Rather than changing the bones of the system, I have
instead added additional material to help GMs and entertain players,
expanding the scope of the game. If you are reading the free PDF
version of this game, you will find everything you need for a full
campaign in these pages. If you have the deluxe version in hand, you
will find almost a hundred pages of bonus content to supply you with
tools for transhuman sci-fi campaigns, space-operatic heroes, stellar
wizardry, mechs, artificial intelligences, and tools for building
sci-fi societies.

Above all, ***Stars Without Number*** is *your* game now. There is no
one “correct” way to play it. There is only your way to play it, and
you should feel free to make it the game you want to play.

# Character Creation

Before you can begin playing ***Stars Without Number***, you need to
roll up a character. While the game can theoretically work with just a
single player and a GM, things work best with 2&#x2013;5 friends in addition
to the GM. A lone adventurer can get in a lot of trouble out there,
and a small group can find it hard to include all the different skills
and talents that are often required to survive a sticky situation.

With that in mind, you and the others in your gaming group should give
a little thought to making characters that work well together. Grim
loners make good book protagonists, but they don't survive well when
there's no author around to bail them out.

When making a character, some players like to simply throw the dice
and see where they lead. Others prefer to know a little more about the
game world and like to have more detail provided beforehand about the
worlds and themes of the game. For those who'd prefer a more detailed
discussion of the world of ***Stars Without Number***, you can skip
ahead to here and read up on it there. For the rest of you&#x2026;


<a id="what-players-need-to-know"></a>

## What Players Need To Know

Your character is an adventurer in the year 3200, a dweller among the
scattered worlds of a great human diaspora. For whatever reason, he or
she has decided to leave their old life behind and take up a
starfaring existence, daring perils and seeking new frontiers in
search of glory, riches, or their own personal ambitions.

Many worlds have recovered from the desperation of the centuries-long
Silence, and can once again manufacture spacecraft and other advanced
technology. Other worlds are “lost worlds”, still cut off from
interstellar trade and forced to make do with the resources of their
own planet. Lostworlders are often considered barbaric by
technologically advanced worlds.

Tramp freighters, small merchant ships, and scout craft serve most
worlds, even the most backward. If your character comes from a
primitive or isolated culture, it's probable that he or she hitched a
ride aboard such a ship to travel to a more cosmopolitan life. It may
or may not have been a voluntary choice.

In actual play, your character should be motivated to *act*, and to
act as part of a group.  The game does not deal well with hostile
loners, apathetic brooders, or other characters that have to be coaxed
into engaging with the world and cooperating with the rest of the
group. The world of ***Stars Without Number*** is dangerous, and
characters who cringe from peril or insist on facing it alone will
find only boredom or an early grave.

Every character should have a goal from the very start. This might be
something as simple as “become wealthy beyond my fondest dreams of
avarice” or “be known as the greatest pilot in the sector”. It might
be as elaborate as “engineer the downfall of the interstellar empire
that conquered my world”. Whatever it is, it should give your
character an immediate reason to go out and do something.

This will to act is especially crucial in ***Stars Without Number***,
because this game is designed to support a “sandbox” style of
gaming. Unlike many other games that encourage the development of a
particular story or the playing out of a specific plot line, ***Stars
Without Number*** presents an entire interstellar sector to your
characters and invites you to choose for yourself how to experience
it. Stories will arise based on what your characters do and how they
respond to the adventure situations provided by the GM.

As a player, you need to cooperate with your GM. This doesn't
necessarily mean following every lead and hook you're given without
demurral, but it does mean that you need to respond to the situations
and possibilities that are given to you.

You also need to keep in mind that your adventurers exist in a very
large world that is not scaled to your characters' abilities. If you
insist on throwing your characters into situations or challenges that
seem overwhelming, the odds are that they will overwhelm
you. Scouting, reconnaissance, and careful intelligence gathering will
help you recognize no-win situations before you push ahead into
them. By the same token, don't hesitate to flee if your party appears
to be facing certain doom. A keen sense of when to decamp the field is
often an experienced adventurer's most valuable asset.


<a id="sidebar-rolling-a-character"></a>

## Rolling a Character

***Stars Without Number*** belongs to a somewhat older tradition in
tabletop RPGs, one where characters aren't so much “built” as they are
“rolled”. Players often don't know who exactly they're going to be
playing in a campaign, and rely on random rolls to determine a hero's
aptitudes and skills. Part of the pleasure of the game is throwing
these new-rolled cyphers into play and exploring their personalities
and motivations directly through the events of the adventures they
undertake.

In most modern games, however, a player expects to be able to create
exactly the kind of PC they've envisioned before the campaign
begins. They don't want to rely on random rolls to give them the
character they're going to be playing.

This is a perfectly valid preference, and players who want to have
full control over creating their hero can do so with an attribute
array and skills picked from a selected background. Even so, players
without strong feelings on the matter might find it refreshing to let
their hero's past be discovered by the unpredictable chance of the
dice.

# Summary of Character Creation

For your convenience, here's a quick summary of the character creation
process. Experienced players can simply go down the list to generate
their next interstellar freebooter, while those new to the game can
use it as a guide reference as they go through the steps detailed on
the following pages. A blank character sheet can be found at the end
of the book.

Note that some steps indicate that you should roll or pick skills, as
described here. The first time you roll or pick a skill, it starts at
level-0. The second time, it becomes level-1. The third time, you can
instead pick any other non-psychic skill of your choice that's less
than level-1. No novice hero's skills can exceed level-1 during
character creation.

1.  Roll your six attributes or assign them from an array, using
    Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
    Charisma. Attributes reflect the basic potential of your hero. Roll
    3d6 six times and assign them in order, or use an array of 14, 12,
    11, 10, 9, 7 assigned as you wish. If you randomly roll your scores
    you may then pick one attribute to change to a score of 14.

2.  Mark down your ***attribute modifiers*** for each score. When rolling
    dice that are affected by an attribute, you don't apply the whole
    score; instead, you apply the attribute modifier. A score of 3 is a
    -2, 4&#x2014;7 is a -1, 8&#x2014;13 is no modifier, 14&#x2014;17 is +1, and 18 is
    +2.

3.  Pick a background from the list, one that most closely reflects
    your hero's past experiences. You gain the skill listed under the
    background name at level-0, which equates to an ordinary working
    knowledge of it.

4.  Decide whether to roll for additional skills or pick them. ***If you
    pick skills***, you can choose two more skills from the Learning
    table for your background, with the exception of entries that say
    “Any Skill”, which you may not pick. You cannot pick entries from
    the Growth table. If you're not sure what to pick, just take the
    “Quick Skills” listed for your background at level-0, which include
    your background's beginning skill.

5.  ***If you choose to roll for your skills***, you can roll up to three
    times, dividing up your rolls between the Growth and Learning
    tables for your background as you wish. When you roll on the Growth
    table, some results may say “+2 Physical” or “+2 Mental”. In the
    former case, you can add two points to either Strength, Dexterity,
    or Constitution, or one point to two different stats. In the latter
    case, you can add two points to either Intelligence, Wisdom, or
    Charisma, or divide the bonus between two of them.

6.  Choose your class, representing those talents you have that are
    most relevant to an adventurer's lifestyle. If your hero isn't
    well-described by Warrior, Expert, or Psychic, you can choose
    Adventurer and mix your class abilities.

7.  Choose your foci, representing the side talents or particular
    specializations of your hero. You can pick one level of a focus of
    your choice. Characters with the Expert class or the Partial Expert
    feature of the Adventurer class get one level of a non-combat,
    non-psychic focus for free in addition to this. They can spend both
    levels on the same focus, starting with level 2 in it if they
    wish. Characters with the Warrior class or Partial Warrior feature
    of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of a
    combat focus.

8.  Optionally, if your GM is allowing alien PCs or VI or True AI PCs,
    you can make your character into one such creature by spending your
    focus level on the appropriate origin focus. Aliens and VIs are
    described in the Xenobestiary chapter, starting here, while True
    AIs are part of the deluxe ***Stars Without Number*** core book,
    starting here.

9.  ***Now pick one non-psychic skill*** of your choice to reflect your
    hero's outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, or
    other personal focus.

10. ***If you've chosen the Psychic class*** or chosen to be an
    Adventurer with the Partial Psychic ability, you are a psychic PC,
    with powers described in the following section, starting
    here. Psychics can pick two psychic skills from those listed here,
    while Partial Psychics can pick one. If a Psychic picks the same
    skill twice, they get it at level-1 expertise, and can pick a free
    level-1 technique from those listed for that discipline. Both
    Psychics and Partial Psychics get the level-0 abilities associated
    with their skills, as described under each discipline they
    possess. Both also have a maximum ***Effort*** score equal to 1 plus
    their highest psychic skill plus the better of their Wisdom or
    Constitution modifiers.

11. Roll your maximum ***hit points*** on 1d6, adding your Constitution
    modifier. Even a penalty can't reduce your hit points
    below 1. Warrior PCs and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior
    class option add 2 points to this total. Hit points indicate how
    close your hero is to being defeated.

12. Note down any base ***attack bonus*** you may have. The higher the
    attack bonus, the easier it is for your hero to land a telling
    blow or shot on a hostile opponent. For most PCs, this bonus is
    +0. If you are a Warrior or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior
    class option, it's +1.

13. ***Choose one of the equipment packages*** here or roll 2d6 x 100 to
    find out how many starting credits you have with which to buy
    gear.

14. ***Mark down your total hit bonus*** with your weaponry. This is
    equal to your base attack bonus, plus either your Punch, Stab, or
    Shoot skill depending on the kind of weapon it is, plus your
    relevant attribute modifier.  The weapon tables starting here,
    will tell you what attribute is used for a particular weapon. If
    two attributes are listed, use the best one for your hero. If you
    haven't even got level-0 skill, take a -2 penalty.

15. ***Note down the damage done*** by your weapons. This is equal to
    its base damage dice plus its attribute modifier. If it's a Punch
    weapon, you can add your Punch skill as well.

16. Record your Armor Class, the measure of how hard it is to hurt
    your hero in a fight. Different suits of armor grant different
    Armor Classes; if you aren't wearing any armor at all, your base
    AC is 10. Add your Dexterity modifier to this. In order to hurt
    your PC, an enemy has to roll an attack roll on a d20, adding
    their attack bonus and equaling or exceeding your Armor Class.

17. Note down your beginning saving throw scores for your Physical,
    Evasion, and Mental saving throws. Physical saves against poison,
    disease, or exhaustion are 15 minus the best of your Strength or
    Constitution modifiers.  Evasion saves to dodge sudden perils or
    dive away from explosives are 15 minus the best of your
    Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers. Mental saves to resist
    psychic influence or mind-bending technology are 15 minus the best
    of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers. To resist these perils, you
    need to equal or beat the save on a d20.

18. Lastly, wrap up your PC with a ***name and a goal***. Every hero
    needs to have a goal when they set out adventuring. This goal
    might change, but your PC should always have *some* reason to go
    out and interact with the world before them. Stay-at-home PCs and
    those unwilling to dare greatly for their aims are rarely fun to
    play.


<a id="attributes"></a>

## Attributes

The first step in creating a character is to determine the character's
six attributes.  Attributes describe how strong, quick, clever,
perceptive, hardy, or charming your hero might be. Attributes are
measured by scores ranging from 3 to 18, with 3 reflecting an
attribute so weak that the PC is barely fit for adventuring and an 18
marking the maximum possible aptitude for an ordinary human.

To generate a character's attributes, roll 3d6 six times and assign
the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You may then change one attribute
of your choice to 14 if you wish to ensure that your new adventurer is
gifted in at least one way.

If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign the following scores
to your attributes in any order you wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If
you assign your scores, you cannot replace one of them with a 14.

Once you've assigned your attributes, record the modifier for each of
them. This modifier is applied to relevant skill checks or other rolls
related to the attribute. If your attribute score changes during play,
either from some crippling injury or from improvements granted by your
background or experience, you should make sure to update any changed
modifier.

## Rolling a PC's Attributes

Simon's rolling up a character for a new campaign. The first step is
to figure out what kind of hero he's going to be playing in the
upcoming game, and that means determining attributes.

If Simon had a particular concept he knew he wanted to play, choosing
to use the array might be a good idea. It provides a predictable set
of numbers he can put in whatever order he wishes, and unless his
concept requires that his PC be particularly gifted in more than one
attribute, the 14 that's part of the array would ensure that he was
capable in whatever natural aptitude was most important to the
concept.

On the other hand, even if he rolls the dice, he knows his hero is
going to be good at something. He can put that free 14 in any
attribute he wishes, so if all he cares about is making sure his PC is
quick, he can rest assured that random rolling will still produce a
quick PC.

Simon, however, really doesn't have any particular concept he knows he
wants to play for this campaign. He decides he's going to let the dice
determine what kind of hero he's going to play. Letting the dice make
the decision helps him break out of any ruts he might be in when it
comes to character concepts, and it can make him consider ideas that
might be fresher in play than his usual fare.

Simon takes three six-sided dice in hand and rolls them six times,
assigning each number in order to his Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. His results
are 10, 4, 13, 16, 8, and 7.

Since 10 or 11 is an average human score, Simon can see that this PC
has a very considerable intellect counterbalanced by pronounced
clumsiness and poor social skills. Because he rolled his statistics,
he can replace one of the rolls with a score of 14. After some
consideration, Simon decides that swapping out his bad Dexterity score
makes the most sense.

Now Simon notes down the attribute modifiers for each of his scores: a
Strength of 10 is +0, a Dexterity of 14 is +1, a Constitution of 13 is
+0, an Intelligence of 16 is +1, a Wisdom of 8 is +0, and a Charisma
of 7 is -1.

When rolling skill checks, attack rolls, or other things modified by
an attribute, Simon will be using the modifier rather than the full
attribute score. The scores themselves might change a little due to
his hero's background or future personal training, but mostly they'll
serve as cues for playing the PC. With a Wisdom of 8, for example,
Simon's hero might not have a penalty to rolls, but he probably makes
the occasional decision he lives to regret.


<a id="skills"></a>

## Skills

Your hero's learned capabilities are ***skills***, and every star-faring
adventurer has their share of them. A hero can usually attempt to do
anything, whether it's to climb a sun-scorched cliff on an alien
world, talk down an enraged lostworlder warlord, or fire a mag rifle
at a charging xenomorph, but having the right skill can make a vast
difference in results.

Skills are measured in a rating from level-0 for competent
practitioners to level-4 for the best in the sector. Novice heroes
start with level-0 or level-1 in their skills. You'll choose or roll
skills in the next section, when you select a background for your
character.


<a id="skill-checks"></a>

## Skill Checks

Your hero is assumed to be competent at all the ordinary functions of
their role and background. If he's a moisture farmer from a
back-of-nowhere desert world, he's going to know how to keep a dew
still running and how to put on a coolsuit. If she's a corporate
magnate's succession-groomed daughter from a megacorp-dominated
hiveworld, she's going to know how to read a balance sheet and speak
during a meeting with C-level executives. They will never fail at
these basic tasks unless some situation makes them much harder than
usual.

Sometimes, however, the hero will be faced with a situation outside
their usual experience, or will try to accomplish a normal task while
under considerable strain or disadvantage. In those cases, you'll need
to roll a ***skill check***.

To roll a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most applicable attribute
modifier and skill level. If the total is equal or greater than the
difficulty of the check, you succeed. If less, something goes wrong,
or you fail outright in the attempt, or something unexpected happens.

If you haven't even got level-0 in the relevant skill you take a -1
penalty to the roll. Some particularly technical or difficult feats
might not be achievable at all without some grounding in the skill.

<a id="the-skill-list"></a>

## The Skill List

The following skills are standard choices for most campaigns. Games
set in unusual reaches of space or unique settings might alter this
list.

Skills are general, and some of them may overlap in some situations. A
hero trying to clear a jammed disruptor cannon before the aliens break
through the door might plausibly check either Fix to repair it or
Shoot to represent their familiarity with weapons
maintenance. Assuming the GM agrees, you can roll whichever skill is
better for you.

-   ***<a id="org4f62a87"></a>:*** Manage an organization, handle paperwork, analyze
    records, and keep an institution functioning on a daily basis. Roll
    it for bureaucratic expertise, organizational management, legal
    knowledge, dealing with government agencies, and understanding how
    institutions really work.

-   ***<a id="orga8758b0"></a>:*** Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get
    them to cooperate with you. Roll it to make useful connections with
    others, find people you know, know where to get illicit goods and
    services, and be familiar with foreign cultures and languages. You
    can use it in place of Talk for persuading people you find via this
    skill.

-   ***<a id="org5da1d82"></a>:*** Apply trained speed, strength, or stamina in some feat
    of physical exertion. Roll it to run, jump, lift, swim, climb,
    throw, and so forth. You can use it as a combat skill when throwing
    things, though it doesn't qualify as a combat skill for other ends.

-   ***<a id="orgde17a45"></a>:*** Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How
    complex will depend on your character's background; a lostworlder
    blacksmith is going to need some study time before he's ready to fix
    that broken fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it
    to fix things, build things, and identify what something is supposed
    to do.

-   ***<a id="org781f6c2"></a>:*** Employ medical and psychological treatment for the injured
    or disturbed. Roll it to cure diseases, stabilize the critically
    injured, treat psychological disorders, or diagnose illnesses.

-   ***<a id="orgc5d7267"></a>:*** Know facts about academic or scientific fields. Roll it to
    understand planetary ecologies, remember relevant history, solve
    science mysteries, and know the basic facts about rare or esoteric
    topics.

-   ***<a id="orgf4357b5"></a>:*** Convince others to also do whatever it is you're trying to
    do. Talk might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead
    can make them do it even when they think it's a bad idea. Roll it to
    lead troops in combat, convince others to follow you, or maintain
    morale and discipline.

-   ***<a id="org6a4c6b5"></a>:*** Spot anomalies or interesting facts about your
    environment. Roll it for searching places, detecting ambushes,
    spotting things, and reading the emotional state of other people.

-   ***<a id="org215de4b"></a>:*** Exhibit some performative skill. Roll it to dance,
    sing, orate, act, or otherwise put on a convincing or emotionally
    moving performance.

-   ***<a id="org0b9dc34"></a>:*** Use this skill to pilot vehicles or ride beasts. Roll it
    to fly spaceships, drive vehicles, ride animals, or tend to basic
    vehicle repair. This skill doesn't help you with things entirely
    outside the scope of your background or experience, though with some
    practice a PC can expand their expertise.

-   ***<a id="org6bdac94"></a>:*** Operating or hacking computing and communications
    hardware. Roll it to program or hack computers, control
    computer-operated hardware, operate communications tech, or decrypt
    things.

-   ***<a id="org9fdc0b1"></a>:*** Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed. If your
    PC means to make a habit of this rather than as a recourse of
    desperation, you should take the *Unarmed Combatant* focus described
    later.

-   ***<a id="org1887072"></a>:*** Use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry,
    whether hurled rocks, bows, laser pistols, combat rifles, or ship's
    gunnery.

-   ***<a id="org7bf4613"></a>:*** Move without drawing notice. Roll it for stealth,
    disguise, infiltration, manual legerdemain, pickpocketing, and the
    defeat of security measures.

-   ***<a id="org46460e4"></a>:*** Use it as a combat skill when wielding melee weapons,
    whether primitive or complex.

-   ***<a id="org21f0594"></a>:*** Obtain the basics of food, water, and shelter in
    hostile environments, along with avoiding their natural perils. Roll
    it to handle animals, navigate difficult terrain, scrounge urban
    resources, make basic tools, and avoid wild beasts or gangs.

-   ***<a id="org32d51e1"></a>:*** Convince other people of the facts you want them to
    believe. What they do with that conviction may not be completely
    predictable. Roll it to persuade, charm, or deceive others in
    conversation.

-   ***<a id="org1d66a63"></a>:*** Find what you need on the market and sell what you
    have. Roll it to sell or buy things, figure out where to purchase
    hard-to-get or illicit goods, deal with customs agents, or run a
    business.

-   ***<a id="org7fcd9eb"></a>:*** This is a catch-all skill for professions not represented
    by other skills. Roll it to work at a particular profession, art, or
    trade.


<a id="psychic-skills"></a>

## Psychic Skills

Unlike other skills, psychic skills are restricted to characters with
the Psychic class or the Partial Psychic class option for
Adventurers. You cannot choose or roll these skills in character
creation unless specifically told to pick a psychic skill.

-   ***Biopsionics:*** Master powers of physical repair, body
    augmentation, and shapeshifting.

-   ***Metapsionics:*** Master powers that nullify, boost, and shape the
    use of other psychic abilities.

-   ***Precognition:*** Master the ability to sense future events and
    control probability.

-   ***Telekinesis:*** Master the remote control of kinetic energy to move
    objects and fabricate force constructs.

-   ***Telepathy:*** Master the reading and influencing of other sapient
    minds.

-   ***Teleportation:*** Master the arts of physical translocation of
    yourself and allies.


<a id="backgrounds"></a>

# Choosing a Background

It's unlikely that your character sprang forth fullgrown from the
endless depths of space, so it's probable that he or she had some sort
of background before adventuring and some kind of training in a field
suitable for the life of an interstellar wayfarer. Of course, the call
of adventure is somewhat indiscriminate, and some people from very
unlikely walks of life might find themselves hurled into the
potentially-lethal excitement of deep space. To determine your hero's
past training, you need to choose or roll a ***background***.

A background is simply a thumbnail description of the kind of life
your hero lived before they took up adventuring. It may not have been
the *only* thing they did with their life, but it's the thing that
taught them most of their existing skills.

When you've chosen or rolled your background, take a moment to think
about your character's past. Decide how your character came to take up
that profession, and what made them put it down to follow a more
adventurous lifestyle. Did they do it for excitement? Friendship?
Money? Or were they just running from a situation they couldn't
handle?

You will also want to pick a homeworld for your PC. Your GM can give
you some suggestions for worlds in their campaign that would fit your
character concept, or you might simply make up your own homeworld or
native space habitat with the GM's permission, as you might be from
some far-distant sector of space.

Twenty backgrounds are provided on the following pages. You may roll
randomly to see where your hero comes from, or pick one that suits
you. If none of the backgrounds appeal to you, you can simply describe
your hero's prior life to the GM and pick any three skills that fit
that past.


<a id="backgrounds-skills-and-growth"></a>

## Backgrounds, Skills, and Growth

Once you pick a background, your hero gains several skills associated
with their past.

First, you get the free skill associated with the background. Every
member of that role or profession needs this skill to function
competently, so your hero gets it as well.

Next, you may either pick two other skills from the Learning table for
your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth
and Learning tables. If you pick skills, you can select exactly the
talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows
your character a little wider range of competence and the option of
attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their
development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if
you wish, to improve its starting proficiency.

If you're not sure what to pick, just take the three skills listed
under “Quick Skills” for your background.

They're the ones most critical to the profession.


<a id="training-skills-and-attributes"></a>

## Training Skills and Attributes

When your character is allowed to pick or roll a skill, you learn it
at level-0 expertise the first time you receive it. If you receive it
a second time, it becomes level-1. If some mechanic or skill choice
allows or obliges you to pick it a third time, you can instead choose
any non-psychic skill in its place. The only way to raise psychic
skills during character creation is via special abilities or foci that
specifically boost them. No starting character can begin with a skill
level higher than level-1.

Sometimes you're allowed to pick “Any Skill”. This means you can
choose any non-psychic skill to improve. Other entries that read “Any
Combat” mean that you can pick either Stab, Shoot, or Punch as you
choose. You cannot raise psychic skills with “Any Skill” picks.

Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic attributes can boost
them up to a maximum of 18. A bonus that applies to “Any Stat” can be
applied to any attribute. If the roll says to add the bonus to
Physical attributes, you can add the bonus to either Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution. If the roll says to add a bonus to your
Mental attributes, you can apply the points to either Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma. If the bonus is +2, you may split the points
between two different attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

<a id="background-barbarian"></a>

### Barbarian

Standards of barbarism vary when many worlds are capable of
interstellar spaceflight, but your hero comes from a savage world of
low technology and high violence. Their planet may have survived an
all-consuming war, or been deprived of critical materials or energy
resources, or simply have been colonized by confirmed Luddites. Other
barbarians might be drawn from the impoverished underclass of advanced
worlds or the technologically-degenerate inheritors of some high-tech
space station or planetary hab.

<a id="background-clergy"></a>

### Clergy

Faith is nigh-universal among human civilizations, and your hero is
dedicated to one such belief. Some clergy are conventional priests or
priestesses, while others might be cloistered monastics or nuns, or
more martial warrior-monks. Modern-day faiths such as Christianity,
Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other creeds all exist in
various sectors, often in altered form, while some worlds have
developed entirely new deities or faiths. If you'd like to create your
own religion, you can work with the GM to define its characteristic
beliefs.

## Building a Background for a PC

Simon's got his hero's attributes set, but those are just part of
making a character. He also needs to figure out where this hero came
from, and what kind of life they've led before they took up the mantle
of an adventuring existence.

If he had a particular preference for a background, he could simply
pick one of the list here. If none of those fit, he could just write
down a few sentences about the background he did want and pick three
skills that fit it, assuming the GM agreed it made sense, or rolled on
the existing background tables that best fit their custom past. But
Simon is still uncertain about the nature of his hero, so he decides
to roll randomly for a background.

He gets a 15, so his hero is a scholar. As a scholar, he automatically
gets the Know skill at level-0, and needs to decide what kind of
scholar he is. Simon considers his options and decides to go with
something he knows; his PC is a literature post-doc by the name of
Basil Hayes.

Simon decides that Basil should continue with his random rolling
rather than just choosing two more skills from the Learning table for
a scholar. Because he chooses to randomly roll, he can make three
rolls, splitting them as he wishes between the Learning or the Growth
table.

His first roll is on the Growth table, and it comes up “+2 Mental”. He
immediately puts it into Intelligence, raising the score to 18 and
giving it a +2 modifier instead of +1. Basil is a brilliant man.

His second roll he makes on the Learning table, and it comes up
“Know”. He already has Know at level-0, so now he gets Know-1. His
third roll comes up “Talk”, giving him Talk-0.

A brief view of Basil's history shows him as a brilliant young scholar
with a keenly refined mind, an excellent grasp of intellectual topics,
and enough glibness to get through a thesis defense. Simon decides
that Basil's occasional fits of social ineptitude have torpedoed his
career in academia, however, and have forced him out into the world to
make a living as an interstellar freebooter.

Simon also needs to pick a homeworld for Basil. While he could ask the
GM for a list of likely places, he decides that Basil hails from the
cold and inhospitable world of Karelia, a planet that relies mostly on
trading the long-duty service contracts of its citizens to other,
wealthier worlds in exchange for vital tech. The GM thinks that
Karelia sounds like the sort of world that would fit in the campaign,
and so allows it. Simon can make up any other details of the world
that are needed as the campaign plays out.

### Courtesan

Your hero's career was one of proffered pleasure. Simple prostitution
is one form of this background, perhaps as an ordinary streetwalker, a
part-time amateur with bills to pay, or an expensive companion to the
wealthy, but other forms of satisfaction exist among the many
worlds. Refined artists of conversation and grace command high fees in
some societies, while others pay well for the simple company of
certain men and women with the right bloodlines, special appearance,
or auspicious personal qualities esteemed by their culture.

### Criminal

Whether thief, murderer, forger, smuggler, spy, or some other variety
of malefactor, your hero was a criminal. Some such rogues are guilty
only of crossing some oppressive government or offending a planetary
lord, while others have done things that no civilized society could
tolerate. Still, their ability to deal with the most desperate and
dangerous of contacts and navigate the perils of a less-than-legal
adventure can make them attractive associates for a party of
freebooters bent on profit and glory more than strict legality.

### Dilettante

Your hero never had a profession, strictly speaking, but spent their
formative years in travel, socializing, and a series of engaging
hobbies. They might have been the scion of a wealthy industrialist, a
planetary noble's younger offspring, or a hanger-on to someone with
the money and influence they lacked. By the time your hero's
adventures start, they've run through the money that once fueled their
lifestyle. Extreme measures may be necessary to acquire further
funding.

### Entertainer

Singers, dancers, actors, poets, writers&#x2026; the interstellar reaches
teem with artists of unnumbered styles and mediums, some of which are
only physically possible with advanced technological support. Your
hero was a dedicated entertainer, one likely focused in a particular
form of art. Patrons and talent scouts can be temperamental, however,
and sometimes a budding artist needs to take steps to find their
audience. Or at least, to find their audience's money.

### Merchant

Your hero was or is a trader. Some merchants are mere peddlers and
shopkeepers on primitive, lowtech worlds, while others are daring far
traders who venture to distant worlds to bring home their alien
treasures. The nature of trade varies widely among worlds. On some of
them, it's a business of soberly-dressed men and women ticking off
trades on virtual terminals, while on others it is a more&#x2026; *active*
pursuit, requiring the judicious application of monoblades and
deniable gunfire against competitors. Sometimes a deal goes bad or
capital needs to be raised, and a merchant's natural talents are
turned toward the perils of adventure.

### Noble

Many planets are ruled by a class of nobles, and your hero was a
member of one such exalted group. Such planets are often worlds of
exquisite courtesy alloyed with utterly remorseless violence, and a
misplaced word at the morning levee can result in an executioner's
monoblade at noon. Your hero has done something or been the victim of
something to dislodge them from their comfortable place at
court. Without their familiar allies, wealth, or influence, they must
take a new place in the world, however distasteful that claiming might
be.

### Official

Most advanced worlds run on their bureaucracies, the legions of
faceless men and women who fill unnumbered roles in keeping the
government running as it should. Your hero was one such official. Some
were law enforcement officers, others government office clerks or tax
officials or trade inspectors. However necessary the work may be, it
is often of unendurably tedious nature, and any man or woman with an
adventurous spark to their blood will soon find themselves desperate
for more exciting use of their talents.

### Peasant

A technologically-advanced world can usually produce all its necessary
foodstuffs and basic resources with a handful of workers, the bulk of
the labor being performed by agricultural bots. On more primitive
worlds, or those with a natural environment that requires close
personal attention to crops, a class of peasants will emerge. These
men and women often become chattel, part and parcel of the land they
occupy and traded among their betters like the farm equipment of
richer worlds. Your hero was not satisfied with that life, and has
done something to break free from their muddy and toilsome past.

### Physician

Bodies wear and break, even on worlds that possess the full resources
of advanced postech medicine. Your hero was a physician, one trained
to cure the maladies of the body or the afflictions of the mind. Some
physicians are conventional health workers, while others are ship's
surgeons, military medics, missionary healers of an expanding faith,
or dubious slum doctors who'll graft over laser burns with no awkward
questions asked. Wherever men and women go into danger, however, the
skills of a physician are eagerly sought.

### Pilot

A pilot's role is a broad one in the far future. The most glamorous
and talented navigate starships through the metadimensional storms of
interstellar space, while less admired figures fly the innumerable
intra-system shuttles and atmosphere craft that serve in most advanced
systems. On other worlds, this career might reflect a long-haul
trucker, or a horse-riding messenger, or an intrepid sailor on an
alien sea. As the Pilot skill covers all these modes of transport, any
character whose role revolves around vehicles or riding beasts might
justify their selection of this career.

### Politician

The nature of a political career varies from world to world. On some,
it's much like one we'd recognize, with glad-handing voters, loud
rallies, and quiet back room deals with supposed rivals in
government. On others, it might involve a great deal more ceremonial
combat, appeals to councils of elders, and success at ritual
trials. Whatever the details, your hero was a politician in their home
culture. Something went wrong, though, and the only way to fix it is
to get clear of your constituents for a while and seek some
alternative means of advancement.

### Scholar

Scientists, sages, and professors all qualify under this career. Your
hero was one such, a man or woman with a life dedicated to knowledge
and understanding. It might have involved the technical expertise of a
metadimensional structures engineer or the sacred memorization of the
chronicles of some lostworlder sage-order, but your hero's life was in
learning. Sometimes that learning cannot be found in familiar
surroundings, however, and for one reason or another, willing or not,
your hero must venture out into the wider world.

### Soldier

Whatever the technology or structure of their parent world, a
soldier's work is universal. Your hero was a professional fighter,
whether that took the form of a barbarian noble's thegn, a faceless
conscript in a planetary army, or an elite soldier in the service of a
megacorp's private military. Whether it was because they were on the
losing side, choosing to leave the service, or being forced to flee a
cause they couldn't fight for, they now find themselves navigating a
world where their most salable skill is one that can cause them a
great deal of trouble.

### Spacer

Almost every advanced world is highly dependent upon the resources
that space flight brings them. Some of this work can be automated, but
every really important task needs a flexible human operator to oversee
the work. Your hero is one such spacer, either a worker who toils in
the sky or a native void-born man or woman who has spent their entire
life outside of natural gravity. It's not uncommon for such workers to
find better prospects in places where they can breathe without a vacc
suit.

### Technician

Old things break and new things need to be made. Whether a humble
lostworlder blacksmith or an erudite astronautic engineer, your hero
made a career out of building and mending the fruits of
technology. While almost every society has a need for such services,
not all of them treat their providers as generously as a technician
might wish. Sometimes, these same talents can be turned toward less
licit ends, and a skilled technician's expertise is always useful to
an adventuring group that plans to rely on anything more sophisticated
than a sharpened stick.

### Thug

Your hero was a bruiser. They might have had a notional allegiance to
some so-called “army”, or have been part of some crime boss' strongarm
crew, or simply been a private contractor of misfortune for those who
failed to pay up. They might have even been a fist in a righteous
cause, defending their neighborhood from hostile outsiders or serving
as informal muscle for a local leader in need of protection. Whatever
the details, they've had to move on from their old life, and their new
one is likely to involve a similar application of directed force.

### Vagabond

A dilettante has money and friends; your hero simply has the
road. Whether they were knocked loose from polite society at a young
age or have recently found themselves cast out of a familiar life,
they now roam the ways of the world and the spaces between. Some
heroes find this life satisfying, with its constant novelty and the
regular excitement of bare survival. Others long for a more stable
arrangement, and are willing to lend their pragmatic talents to a
group that offers some prospect of profit.

### Worker

Countless in number, every industrialized world has swarms of workers
to operate the machines and perform the labor that keeps society
functioning. Cooks, factory laborers, mine workers, personal servants,
lawyers, clerks, and innumerable other roles are covered under this
career. If your hero rolls or picks Work as a skill but has a career
that would better fit another existing skill, they may substitute it
accordingly. Thus, a wage-slave programmer might take Program instead
of Work, while a lawyer would use Administer instead as a reflection
of their litigious talent.

# Character Classes

In one way or another, your character is cut out for adventure. Your
hero might be a veteran combatant, skilled with blade or laser, or
they might be a psychic gifted with uncanny abilities. It's just as
possible that they could have remarkable talents as a pilot, or be the
smoothest grifter in the hiveslum they grew up in. Whatever their
particular background, your hero's primary focus is their ***class***.

Your class represents your hero's best set of tools for dealing with
their problems. They're the skills and capabilities that they're most
likely to turn to to resolve a problem, but not their only tools. A
Psychic can still shoot a gun and a Warrior can try to fast-talk a
mark.

Choosing a class helps ensure that your hero is good at *something*
that might contribute to a bold party of interstellar
adventurers. Experts always have a knack at exercising non-combat
skills, Warriors are always good in a scrap, and Psychics always have
a unique power or two to employ at need. Your hero might have led a
quiet life as a starport customs clerk until recently, but their
natural talents will ensure that they can do something that the rest
of the group will find useful.

In the same vein, you don't have to choose a class that “naturally”
fits with your background. That starport customs clerk might have led
a peaceful life untroubled by anything worse than portside brawls, but
inside her burns a seething, latent fury that is ready to explode at
the first opportunity. She's a Warrior, even though she might not
realize her talents until the first time she snatches up a dropped
laser rifle and unleashes a barrage of death on a pack of alien
warbeasts. You should pick whatever class for your hero that matches
the kind of play you want to have with them.

There are four possible classes you can choose for your hero:
Adventurer, Expert, Psychic, and Warrior. Experts are PCs that rely on
non-combat skills such as stealth, persuasion, technical expertise,
piloting skills, vast learning, or personal connections. Psychics are
those rare men and women affected by Metadimensional Extroversion
Syndrome, ones capable of channeling these metadimensional energies to
perform feats of telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and other
psionic disciplines. Warriors are hardened combatants, skilled in the
arts of war and violent conflict, and Adventurers include those with a
mix of talents and abilities, ones who don't fit well into one of the
other classes.

Choose a class that best fits your character's concept. If Expert,
Psychic, or Warrior don't fit your image of your hero, or if you want
to customize their abilities, you can choose the Adventurer class.


<a id="class-expert"></a>

## Expert

Your hero is exceptionally good at a useful skill. Doctors, cat
burglars, starship pilots, grifters, technicians, or any other concept
that focuses on expertise in a non-combat skill should pick the Expert
class. Experts are the best at such skills and gain more of them than
other classes do.

Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make a shot when the chips are
down, an Expert has a knack for succeeding at the moments of greatest
importance. Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a failed skill check,
taking the new result if it's better. This benefit can be applied to
any skill check, even those that the Expert isn't specially focused
in. Their natural talent bleeds over into everything they do.

In their chosen field, however, the Expert is exceptionally
gifted. Aside from the free focus level that all PCs get at the start
of the game, an Expert can choose an additional level in a non-combat
focus related to their background. They can spend both of these levels
on the same focus if they wish, thus starting the game with level 2 in
that particular knack.


<a id="class-abilities-expert"></a>

### Class Abilities

Every Expert PC has certain special abilities.

-   You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your
    background. Most concepts will take *Specialist* in their main
    skill, though *Diplomat*, *Starfarer*, *Healer*, or some other focus
    might suit better. You may not take a combat-oriented focus with
    this perk. In case of uncertainty, the GM decides whether or not a
    focus is permitted.

-   Once per scene, you can reroll a failed skill check, taking the new
    roll if it's better.

-   When you advance an experience level, you gain a bonus skill point
    that can be spent on any non-combat, non-psychic skill. You can save
    this point to spend later if you wish.


<a id="hit-points-and-attack-bonus-expert"></a>

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and add your
Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Your attack bonus
is equal to half your character level, rounded down, so it's +0 at
first level.


<a id="class-psychic"></a>

## Psychic

Your hero has received training in controlling their natural
Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, and can wield the psychic
powers that come from that strange affliction. Controlling and
developing psychic abilities is an extremely demanding process but
allows for feats wholly impossible to ordinary men and women.

Psychics are extremely rare in the general population. Averages vary
with worlds, but most range from one in ten thousand to one in a
hundred thousand who have the MES condition that make them amenable to
psychic training. Some of these go their entire lives without
realizing their capabilities. Others end up exploiting their native
abilities without training, almost inevitably ending up seriously
brain-damaged or crazed by the effects of unmediated metadimensional
energy.

Your hero has been fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or other
training institution capable of molding and directing these
abilities. They may have come to this later in life, or been recruited
young by a society that carefully watches for MES symptoms.

Some societies deal with their psychics more generously than
others. On some worlds, psychic powers are accepted and their
possessors can look forward to lucrative and respected employment. On
others, fear of these uncanny powers and memories of the horrors of
the Scream lead to less welcoming treatment.


<a id="class-abilities-psychic"></a>

### Class Abilities

Every Psychic PC has certain special abilities.

-   Unlike Warriors or Experts, you are capable of learning psychic
    disciplines and their associated techniques, as described starting
    here.

-   When you pick this class, choose any two psychic skills as bonus
    skills. You can pick the same one twice to obtain level-1
    proficiency in it and a free level-1 technique from that discipline.

-   You have an Effort score, which can be used to fuel psychic
    abilities. Your maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus your highest
    psychic skill plus the better of your Wisdom or Constitution
    modifiers. Even with a penalty, your maximum Effort cannot be lower
    than 1.


<a id="hit-points-and-attack-bonus-psychic"></a>

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and add your
Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Your attack bonus
is equal to half your character level, rounded down, so it's +0 at
first level.


<a id="class-warrior"></a>

## Warrior

Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder, gengineered combat
hominid, or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk
job, your hero has a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in
***Stars Without Number*** is extremely dangerous, but your hero has the
talents to survive situations that would kill a less martial
adventurer.

As a gifted purveyor of violence, you get to pick an extra
combat-related focus associated with your special brand of
havoc. While a character of any class can take these special combat
talents, you get this additional pick and a better natural hit bonus
than heroes of other classes.

Most importantly, however, Warriors have an uncanny gift for making a
shot when a hit is desperately needed, or dodging a bullet when their
life is on the line. Once per scene, a Warrior can either
automatically negate a successful combat hit they just received,
taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one of their own
missed attack rolls into an automatic hit. This versatility makes
Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and
significantly more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general
melee.


<a id="class-abilities-warrior"></a>

### Class Abilities

Every Warrior PC has certain special abilities.

-   You gain a free level in a combat-related focus associated with your
    background. The GM decides if a focus qualifies if it's an ambiguous
    case.

-   Warriors are lucky in combat. Once per scene, as an Instant ability,
    you can either choose to negate a successful attack roll against you
    or turn a missed attack roll you made into a successful hit. You can
    use this ability after the dice are rolled, but it cannot be used
    against environmental damage, effects without an attack roll, or
    hits on a vehicle you're occupying.

-   You gain two extra maximum hit points at each character level.


<a id="hit-points-and-attack-bonus-warrior"></a>

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6+2 and add your
Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Your attack bonus
is equal to your character level so it is +1 at first level.


<a id="class-adventurer"></a>

## Adventurer

The Adventurer class is the catch-all for heroes who don't fit so
neatly into the other three categories. Perhaps your mercenary spent
her girlhood at a psychic academy, or maybe your combat medic knows
more about using a laser rifle than most physicians do. You can use
the Adventurer class to customize your hero's abilities, trading focus
for wider versatility.

Adventurers split their focus between different spheres, gaining
weaker versions of each class' benefits. For example, an Adventurer
who is a psionic warrior-adept might have considerable powers of
telekinetic force and a brutal expertise at bare-handed combat, but
they won't have access to the wider psionic potential of an
unrestricted Psychic or the death-defying combat luck of a hardened
Warrior.

To define your Adventurer's abilities, pick two of the following three
partial classes.


<a id="class-partial-expert"></a>

### Partial Expert

You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your
background. Most concepts will take *Specialist*, though *Diplomat*,
*Starfarer*, *Healer*, or some other focus might suit better. Gain an
extra skill point every time you gain a character level which can be
spent on any non-psychic, non-combat skill.


<a id="class-partial-psychic"></a>

### Partial Psychic

You are a restricted psychic. Pick one psychic discipline as a bonus
skill at level-0. You can improve this skill with foci or skill points
gained from advancing a level, but you cannot learn or improve any
other psychic skill. Your maximum Effort equals 1 plus this psychic
skill's level plus the best of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers,
down to a minimum of 1.


<a id="class-partial-warrior"></a>

### Partial Warrior

You gain a free level in a combat focus related to your
background. Gain +1 to your attack bonus at first and fifth
levels. Gain 2 extra maximum hit points each level. Thus, at first
level, you'd roll 1d6+2 for your maximum hit points. At second, you'd
roll 2d6+4, and so forth.


<a id="hit-points-and-attack-bonus-adventurer"></a>

### Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and add your
Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. Adventurers who've
taken the Partial Warrior option add 2 hit points to their maximum.

The base attack bonus for Adventurers is equal to half their character
level, rounded down, so +0 at first level. If the PC has taken the
Partial Warrior option their class bonus increases this to +1 at first
level.


<a id="choosing-a-focus"></a>

# Choosing a Focus

Every member of a class has certain baseline abilities that let them
do well at their role. Warriors are always good combatants, Experts
are always gifted with their skills, and Psychics always have a few
pertinent psionic abilities. Aside from these baseline abilities,
characters also have a ***focus***.

A focus is an additional knack, perk, or aptitude that a hero has, one
that grants them certain benefits in play. Each focus has one or more
levels of increasingly-strong effect. For example, someone with level
1 in the *Die Hard* focus gains two extra maximum hit points each
level and automatically stabilizes after a mortal wound, while someone
with level 2 can negate the first injury they suffer each day that
would incapacitate or kill them. The benefits of a focus stack, so if
you take level 2 in one, you get all the benefits from level 1 as
well.

Any character can pick any focus, and it doesn't have to “match” the
class you selected. A Psychic can choose the *Unarmed Combatant* focus
for fistic prowess, while a Warrior might have enough experience with
battlefield trauma to qualify as a *Healer*. The only obligation is
that you explain how your hero picked up the training or exhibited
their natural aptitude for the focus.

Many foci give a bonus level in a skill as part of their level 1
benefits. These bonus levels work like any other skill pick; they
either give you the skill at level-0, raise an existing level-0 skill
to level-1, or let you pick any other non-psychic skill if the skill
is already at level-1.

Unless indicated otherwise a focus can be taken only once. Once you've
taken level 1 of *Die Hard*, you can't pick it again to get an
additional two hit points per level. Some skill-oriented foci allow
you to pick them more than once to apply to different skills.

Beginning PCs can pick one level of focus. PCs with the Expert class
or the Partial Expert Adventurer class option can choose an additional
level in any non-combat focus related to their background, including
level 2 in their initial choice. Most will choose *Specialist*,
*Healer*, *Diplomat*, or some other similar focus, but the GM can
allow other non-combat foci. PCs with the Warrior class or the Partial
Warrior Adventurer class option can do the same in choosing an
additional combat-related focus.

As your hero advances in experience, you'll get the opportunity to
pick up new foci or improve existing ones as you refine your talents
or learn new tricks. In some cases, you might work with the GM to come
up with a custom focus reflecting your PC's specific special talent or
a perk that makes sense given their recent adventures. Foci are an
important part of a hero's character, and they should always reflect
something basic about how they tend to interact with the world.


<a id="origin-foci"></a>

## Origin Foci

If you include aliens or robots in your campaign, you can represent
them with *origin foci*. Origin foci are taken the same way as any
other foci, and may be purchased with a beginning character's focus
level.

If a GM is feeling generous, they can allow a PC to take a level in an
origin focus as well as their usual free focus level, in order to
allow a hero to start as an alien with some additional knack. A PC who
takes this option doesn't get their usual bonus focus at level 2;
they've already spent it on being unusual.

Origin foci for robotic VIs are here. Available alien races will vary
with the campaign setting, but details on making these race are here.


<a id="sidebar-choosing-a-class-and-focus"></a>

# Choosing a Class and Focus

Basil Hayes needs a class. While an obvious pick would be Expert to
match his background, Simon decides it would be more amusing to make
him a soldier; specifically, the sniper “Basilisk” Hayes, the
dire-eyed wraith of the cold Karelian forest. Given the complete lack
of a market for his PhD and his own natural poor judgment, Basil
signed up with a Karelian mercenary outfit. He's just gotten out of
his tour of duty, but at least now his skills are significantly more
marketable.

While Simon could go with the Adventurer class for Basil and make him
a Partial Warrior/ Partial Expert, he decides to make Basil a
fullfledged Warrior. His intellectual talents can be useful, but
Basil's main utility to the group is his ability to deal with combat
situations.

Every PC gets to pick one focus of any kind, and a Warrior gets to
pick one combat-related focus. Basil's first choice is easy, as
clearly he's a Sniper, so he writes that down as a level 1
focus. Rather than taking a second level in that with his other pick,
Simon decides to have Basil pick up a level of the Gunslinger
focus. Basil will get the chance to pick more foci as he gains
experience.

Each of these foci grant a bonus level in Shoot, so they stack
together to give the young sniper a Shoot-1 skill. Basil's now as deft
with a rifle as he is with 19th century Terran Victorian poetry.

Lastly, Basil gets to pick any single non-psychic skill of his choice
as a hobby or natural talent. He decides that a sniper isn't much of a
sniper without being hard to spot, so picks Sneak-0 as his skill. This
free skill pick is often useful for filling in the necessary talents
of a concept that aren't supplied by the Learning table or bonus
skills granted by a hero's foci.


<a id="focus-list"></a>

## The Focus List


<a id="focus-alert"></a>

### Alert

You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to
take unaware. You have an instinctive alacrity of response that helps
you act before less wary persons can think to move.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be surprised,
    nor can others use the Execution Attack option on you. When you roll
    initiative, roll twice and take the best result.

-   ***Level 2:*** You always act first in a combat round unless someone
    else involved is also this *Alert*.


<a id="focus-armsman"></a>

### Armsman

You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee
attacks. This focus' benefits do not apply to unarmed attacks or
projectile weapons. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of
the *Armsman* focus at the same time as *Gunslinger*.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Stab as a bonus skill. You can draw or sheath a
    Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant action. You may add your
    Stab skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's damage roll or Shock
    damage, assuming it has any to begin with.

-   ***Level 2:*** Your primitive melee and thrown weapons count as TL4
    weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a
    miss with a melee weapon, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage to the
    target, plus any Shock damage. This bonus damage doesn't apply to
    thrown weapons or attacks that use the Punch skill.


<a id="focus-assassin"></a>

### Assassin

You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in
carrying out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on page 52.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object
    no larger than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a
    strip search, including normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can
    draw or produce this object as an On Turn action, and your
    point-blank ranged attacks made from surprise with it cannot miss
    the target.

-   ***Level 2:*** You can take a Move action on the same round as you
    make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly with a target before you
    attack. You may split this Move action when making an Execution
    Attack, taking part of it before you murder your target and part of
    it afterwards. This movement happens too quickly to alert a victim
    or to be hindered by bodyguards, barring an actual physical wall of
    meat between you and your prey.


<a id="focus-authority"></a>

### Authority

You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others
instinctively follow your instructions and further your causes. At
level 1, this is a knack of charm and personal magnetism, while level
2 might suggest latent telepathic influence or transhuman memetic
hacking augmentations. Where this focus refers to followers, it means
NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be in your service. PCs never
count as followers.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you can make
    a request from an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a
    Cha/Lead skill check at a difficulty of the NPC's Morale score. If
    you succeed, they will comply with the request, provided it is not
    harmful or extremely uncharacteristic.

-   ***Level 2:*** Those who follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC
    being directly led by you gains a Morale and hit roll bonus equal to
    your Lead skill and a +1 bonus on all skill checks. Your followers
    will not act against your interests unless under extreme pressure.


<a id="focus-close-combatant"></a>

### Close Combatant

You've had all too much practice at close-in fighting and desperate
struggles with pistol or blade. You're extremely skilled at avoiding
injury in melee combat, and at level 2 you can dodge through a melee
scrum without fear of being knifed in passing.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain any combat skill as a bonus skill. You can use
    pistol-sized ranged weapons in melee without suffering penalties for
    the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee
    assailants, even if you're unarmored at the time.

-   ***Level 2:*** The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all
    targets as if they were AC 10. The [*Fighting Withdrawal*](#fighting-withdrawal-main-action) combat
    action is treated as an On Turn action for you and can be performed
    freely.


<a id="focus-connected"></a>

### Connected

You're remarkably gifted at making friends and forging ties with the
people around you. Wherever you go, you always seem to know somebody
useful to your ends.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you've spent at least
    a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you'll have built a web
    of contacts willing to do favors for you that are no more than
    mildly illegal. You can call on one favor per game day and the GM
    decides how far they'll go for you.

-   ***Level 2:*** Once per game session, if it's not entirely
    implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest
    favors for you. You can decide when and where you want to meet this
    person, but the GM decides who they are and what they can do for
    you.


<a id="focus-die-hard"></a>

### Die Hard

You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up
under stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.

-   ***Level 1:*** You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per level. This
    bonus applies retroactively if you take this focus after first
    level. You automatically stabilize if mortally wounded by anything
    smaller than a Heavy weapon.

-   ***Level 2:*** The first time each day that you are reduced to zero
    hit points by an injury, you instead survive with one hit point
    remaining. This ability can't save you from [Heavy weapons](#heavy-weapons-quick-links) or similar
    trauma.


<a id="focus-diplomat"></a>

### Diplomat

You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can
manipulate the attitudes of those around you. Even so, while smooth
words are versatile, they'll only work if your interlocutor is
actually willing to listen to you.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Talk as a bonus skill. You speak all the languages
    common to the sector and can learn new ones to a workable level in a
    week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check dice
    related to negotiation or diplomacy.

-   ***Level 2:*** Once per game session, shift an intelligent NPC's
    reaction roll one step closer to friendly if you can talk to them
    for at least thirty seconds.


<a id="focus-gunslinger"></a>

### Gunslinger

You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to
slugthrowers or energy weapons, it is also applicable to thrown
weapons, bows, or other [ranged weapons](#ranged-weapons) that can be used with the Shoot
skill. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of the *Armsman*
focus at the same time as *Gunslinger*.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can draw or holster a
    Stowed ranged weapon as an On Turn action. You may add your Shoot
    skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.

-   ***Level 2:*** Once per round, you can reload a ranged weapon as an On
    Turn action if it takes no more than one round to reload. Even on a
    miss with a Shoot attack, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage.


<a id="focus-hacker"></a>

### Hacker

You have a considerable fluency with digital security measures and
standard encryption methods. You know how to make computerized systems
obey you until their automatic failsafes come down on your control.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack
    a database or computerized system, roll 3d6 on the skill check and
    drop the lowest die.

-   ***Level 2:*** Your hack duration increases to 1d4+Program skill x 10
    minutes. You have an instinctive understanding of the tech; you
    never need to learn the data protocols for a strange system and are
    always treated as familiar with it.


<a id="focus-healer"></a>

### Healer

Healing comes naturally to you, and you're particularly gifted at
preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to
    stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On
    Turn action. When rolling Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the
    lowest die.

-   ***Level 2:*** Stims or other technological healing devices applied by
    you heal twice as many hit points as normal. Using only basic
    medical supplies, you can heal 1d6+Heal skill hit points of damage
    to every injured or wounded person in your group with ten minutes of
    first aid spread among them. Such healing can be applied to a given
    target only once per day.


<a id="focus-henchkeeper"></a>

### Henchkeeper

You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do
your bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power,
excitement, sex, or some other prize that you may or may not
eventually grant. A henchman obtained with this focus will serve in
loyal fashion until clearly betrayed or placed in unacceptable
danger. Henchmen are not “important” people in their society, and are
usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the desperate, or other persons with
few options.

You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional
henchmen, but these extra hirelings are no more loyal or competent
than your pay and treatment can purchase.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen
    within 24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is
    suitable hench material. These henchmen will not fight except to
    save their own lives, but will escort you on adventures and risk
    great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be treated as Peaceful
    Humans from the Xenobestiary section of the book. You can have one
    henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have,
    rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings at any
    plausible time and pick them back up later should you be without a
    current henchman.

-   ***Level 2:*** Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and determined, and
    will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming
    odds. Whether through natural competence or their devotion to you,
    they're treated as Martial Humans from the Xenobestiary section. You
    can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs,
    but this requires that you actually have done them some favor or
    help that would reasonably earn such fierce loyalty.


<a id="focus-ironhide"></a>

### Ironhide

Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, gengineered skin
fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding, you have natural defenses
equivalent to high-quality combat armor. The benefits of this focus
don't stack with armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.

-   ***Level 1:*** You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half your
    character level, rounded up.

-   ***Level 2:*** Your abilities are so effective that they render you
    immune to unarmed attacks or primitive weaponry as if you wore
    powered armor.


<a id="focus-psychic-training"></a>

### Psychic Training

You've had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You
must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial Psychic class option as an
Adventurer to pick this focus. In the latter case, you can only take
training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial
Psychic. As with most foci, this focus can be taken only once.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain any psychic skill as a bonus. If this improves it
    to level-1 proficiency, choose a free level-1 technique from that
    discipline. Your maximum Effort increases by one.

-   ***Level 2:*** When you advance a level, the bonus psychic skill you
    chose for the first level of the focus automatically gets one skill
    point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from
    it. You may save these points for later, if more are required to
    raise the skill or buy a particular technique. These points are
    awarded retroactively if you take this focus level later in the
    game.


<a id="focus-savage-fray"></a>

### Savage Fray

You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can survive
being surrounded far better than most combatants.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Stab as a bonus skill. All enemies adjacent to you
    at the end of your turn whom you have not attacked suffer the Shock
    damage of your weapon if their Armor Class is not too high to be
    affected.

-   ***Level 2:*** After suffering your first melee hit in a round, any
    further melee attacks from other assailants automatically miss
    you. If the attacker who hits you has multiple attacks, they may
    attempt all of them, but other foes around you simply miss.


<a id="focus-shocking-assault"></a>

### Shocking Assault

You're extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your
melee attacks stresses and distracts enemies even when your blows
don't draw blood.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock damage
    of your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10, assuming
    your weapon is capable of harming the target in the first place.

-   ***Level 2:*** In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock damage
    rating of all melee weapons and unarmed attacks. Regular hits never
    do less damage than this Shock would do on a miss.


<a id="focus-sniper"></a>

### Sniper

You are an expert at placing a bullet or beam on an unsuspecting
target. These special benefits only apply when making an Execution
Attack with a firearm or bow, as described on page 52.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a skill check
    for an Execution Attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the
    lowest die.

-   ***Level 2:*** A target hit by your Execution Attack takes a -4
    penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal
    injury. Even if the save is successful, the target takes double the
    normal damage inflicted by the attack.


<a id="focus-specialist"></a>

### Specialist

You are remarkably talented at a particular skill. Whether a marvelous
cat burglar, a world-famous athlete, a brilliant engineer, or some
other savant, your expertise is extremely reliable. You may take this
focus more than once for different skills.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain a non-combat, non-psychic skill as a bonus. Roll
    3d6 and drop the lowest die for all skill checks in this skill.

-   ***Level 2:*** Roll 4d6 and drop the two lowest dice for all skill
    checks in this skill.


<a id="focus-star-captain"></a>

### Star Captain

You have a tremendous natural talent for ship combat, and can make any
starship you captain a significantly more fearsome opponent. You must
take the captain's role during a fight as described on page 117 of the
Ship Combat rules in order to benefit from this focus.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Your ship gains 2 extra
    Command Points at the start of each turn.

-   ***Level 2:*** A ship you captain gains bonus hit points equal to 20%
    of its maximum at the start of each combat. Damage is taken from
    these bonus points first, and they vanish at the end of the fight
    and do not require repairs to replenish before the next. In
    addition, once per engagement, you may resolve a Crisis as an
    Instant action by explaining how your leadership resolves the
    problem.


<a id="focus-starfarer"></a>

### Starfarer

You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike
drills. While most experienced pilots can manage conventional drills
along well-charted spike routes, you have the knack for forging new
drill paths and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically succeed
    at all spike drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.

-   ***Level 2:*** Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related
    skill checks. Spike drives of ships you navigate are treated as one
    level higher; thus, a drive-1 is treated as a drive-2, up to a
    maximum of drive-7. Spike drills you personally oversee take only
    half the time they would otherwise require.


<a id="focus-tinker"></a>

### Tinker

You have a natural knack for modifying and improving equipment, as
given in the rules on page 90.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance score is
    doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many mods. Both ship and
    gear mods cost only half their usual price in credits, though
    pretech salvage requirements remain the same.

-   ***Level 2:*** Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for
    purposes of building and maintaining mods and calculating your
    Maintenance score. Advanced mods require one fewer pretech salvage
    part to make, down to a minimum of zero.


<a id="focus-unarmed-combatant"></a>

### Unarmed Combatant

Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives and guns in the grip
of the less gifted. Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons
when it comes to binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long
arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed attacks
    become more dangerous as your Punch skill increases. At level-0,
    they do 1d6 damage. At level-1, they do 1d8 damage. At level-2 they
    do 1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 1d12+1. At Punch-1 or
    better, they have the Shock quality equal to your Punch skill
    against AC 15 or less. While you normally add your Punch skill level
    to any unarmed damage, don't add it twice to this Shock damage.

-   ***Level 2:*** You know locks and twists that use powered servos
    against their wearer. Your unarmed attacks count as TL4 weapons for
    the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a
    Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage.


<a id="focus-unique-gift"></a>

### Unique Gift

Whether due to exotic technological augmentation, a unique transhuman
background, or a remarkable human talent, you have the ability to do
something that's simply impossible for a normal human.

This is a special focus which serves as a catch-all for some novel
power or background perk that doesn't have a convenient fit in the
existing rules. A transhuman who can function normally in lethal
environments, a nanotech-laden experimental subject with a head full
of exotic sensors, or a brilliant gravitic scientist who can fly
thanks to their personal tech might all take this focus to cover their
special abilities.

It's up to the GM to decide what's reasonable and fair to be covered
under this gift. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might
require the user to take System Strain to use it, as described on
page 32.

As a general rule this ability should be better than a piece of gear
the PC could buy for credits. The player is spending a very limited
resource when they make this focus pick, so what they get should be
good enough that they can't just duplicate it with a fat bank account.


<a id="focus-wanderer"></a>

### Wanderer

Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road, they've mastered
a number of tricks for ensuring their mobility and surviving the
inevitable difficulties of a vagabond existence.

-   ***Level 1:*** Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey basic
    ideas in all the common languages of the sector. You can always find
    free transport to a desired destination for yourself and a small
    group of your friends provided any traffic goes to the
    place. Finding this transport takes no more than an hour, but it may
    not be a strictly legitimate means of travel and may require working
    passage.

-   ***Level 2:*** You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers and
    identification for the party with 1d6 hours of work. These papers
    and permits will stand up to ordinary scrutiny, but require an
    opposed Int/Administer versus Wis/Notice check if examined by an
    official while the PC is actually wanted by the state for some
    crime. When finding transport for the party, the transportation
    always makes the trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter would.


<a id="focus-wild-psychic-talent"></a>

### Wild Psychic Talent

Some men and women are born with a very limited form of MES, the
mental condition that allows for the use of psychic powers. While
these people are not true psychics, these “wild talents” can create
one limited psychic effect. Training is not always required to develop
this ability, and their MES is so mild that they don't suffer the risk
of madness or brain damage that more developed psychics risk should
they use their powers without proper training.

Wild talents are not treated as psychics for general purposes and
cannot “torch” their powers. When relevant, they are treated as having
one point of Effort. Psychics and Partial Psychics cannot take this
focus.

-   ***Level 1:*** Pick a psychic discipline. You gain an ability
    equivalent to the level-0 core power of that discipline. Optionally,
    you may instead pick a level-1 technique from that discipline, but
    that technique must stand alone; you can't pick one that augments
    another technique or core ability. For example, you could pick the
    *Telekinetic Armory* technique from Telekinesis, because that
    ability does not require the use of any other Telekinesis power. You
    could not pick the *Mastered Succor* ability from Biopsionics,
    because that technique is meant to augment another power you don't
    have.

-   ***Level 2:*** You now have a maximum Effort of two points. You may
    pick a second ability according to the guidelines above. This second
    does not need to be a stand-alone technique if it augments the power
    you chose for level 1 of this focus. Thus, if your first pick was
    gaining the level-0 power of *Psychic Succor*, your second could be
    *Mastered Succor*. You still could not get the level-1 core power of
    *Psychic Succor*, however, as you're still restricted to level-0.


<a id="org503b625"></a>

# Final Touches

You're almost finished. Just a few more things to note down, and
you'll have an adventurer ready for play.

First, pick one more non-psychic skill of your choice. This pick
represents your hobbies, your side interests, or some well of natural
talent. You gain it at level-0 if you don't already have
it. Otherwise, it stacks to increase the skill to level-1. You can't
pick a skill you already have at level-1.

Next, determine your maximum ***hit points***. Your hit points are a
measure of how close you are to death or defeat; when you run out of
them, your character is dead or unable to continue fighting. You can
regain lost hit points by rest and biopsionic healing, but they cannot
exceed their maximum. Your maximum hit points are equal to 1d6 plus
your Constitution modifier, down to a minimum of 1 hit point. Warriors
and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option can add a +2
bonus to this total.

Now note down your ***base attack bonus***. For most PCs, this is equal
to half your character level, rounded down, so it's +0 for most
characters. If your hero is a Warrior or an Adventurer with the
Partial Warrior class option, your beginning base attack bonus is +1.

Record your Physical, Mental, and Evasion [saving throws](#saving-throws). Your Physical
saving throw is 15 minus the better of your Strength or Constitution
attribute modifiers. Your Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better
of your Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. Your Evasion saving
throw is 15 minus the better of your Dexterity or Intelligence
attribute modifiers. If you have a penalty in both modifiers, it's
possible to have a saving throw of 16 or more.

Lastly, either choose an equipment package from the list starting [here](#equipment-packages)
or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out how many credits you have to buy your
beginning gear.


<a id="sidebar-pcs-and-languages"></a>

## PCs and Languages

The standard language of the late Terran Mandate was a highly
hybridized version of English. All PCs are assumed to speak “Mandate”
unless they've got a very good reason not to, and will rapidly pick up
enough to get by otherwise.

PCs also speak all the languages appropriate to their background and
history. A native of a French-speaking world will naturally speak
French, or whatever French is in 3200 AD.

Linguist PCs with the Know skill know additional languages; one more
at level-0, three more at level-1, six more at level-2, ten more at
level-3, and all sector-known languages at level-4. PCs who are
far-traveled or versed in dealing with other cultures may substitute
Connect instead of Know to determine their bonus languages.


<a id="equipment-packages"></a>

# Equipment Packages

Rather than choosing gear from the Equipment chapter, you can just
take a premade package from the following pages instead of taking your
starting credits.

Once you’ve chosen your equipment, make sure to note down the damage
and hit bonus of your weapons, and the Armor Class of any armor you
have.

For weapons, your hit bonus is your base attack bonus plus your
applicable skill, plus the attribute modifier used by the weapon. For
[ranged weapons](#ranged-weapons), this is usually Dexterity, while most melee weapons
are Strength or Dexterity. Ranged energy weapons add +1 to this, as
they lack recoil or windage. Damage is equal to the weapon's damage
die plus the attribute modifier.

For armor, your total Armor Class is that of your armor plus your
Dexterity modifier. Multiple suits of armor do not stack together.

# Quick Character Creation

If you don’t have the time or inclination to do things the leisurely
way, you can use the following pages to quickly roll up a hero. You
can either pick or roll from any of the tables to get a character that
suits.

The first step is to roll on the class table below. This will give you
your class, your attributes, the hit point die to roll, and your
attack bonus. Each class “style” hints at the kind of PC those
attributes might describe.

Next, it's time to pick or roll from the background table to the
right. Don't worry if it doesn't seem to fit your class; if your Melee
Warrior happens to roll a past as a Scholar, just take a moment to
decide why it is that an erudite scientist might also have a savage
left hook. You can switch around your attributes if you want to make
things fit more closely, such as swapping your Intelligence and
Charisma in the case above.

The background options are general concepts as described starting on
[here](#backgrounds). Your hero might be a model example of their type, or you might
shuffle around their details a little, deciding your Ranged Warrior
Official is an ex-cop bounced out of the force after investigating an
alien smuggling ring a little too closely.

Once you've rolled or chosen your background, note down the three
skills listed with it. If one of the skills says “Any Combat”, choose
either Punch, Shoot, or Stab depending on what fits best for your
hero.

You'll want to decide on your homeworld at this point too. If you're
not familiar with the campaign setting, describe your hero's
background and ask the GM which planet they're most likely from. The
GM can then fill you in on any important cultural or social details
that might've influenced your hero's history.

If you picked or rolled the Psychic class, roll twice on the table to
the left to find out what psychic disciplines you've trained to
level-0. If you roll or pick the same one twice, it's level-1, and you
should pick a free level-1 technique from the Psionics chapter [here](#chapter-psionics).

Take a minute to decide where you were trained to safely use your
innate powers. If you're not sure, ask the GM which psychic academy
makes the most sense.

Now roll 1d6 or pick from the table below to get appropriate foci for
your hero, assuming you'd rather not pick freely. All the foci listed
below are gained at level 1 proficiency and are described starting
here. Psychics can pick one focus. The other classes get one free
pick, plus one more combat focus for Warriors and one more non-combat
focus for Experts.

When you choose a focus, you might get a bonus skill from it. If you
don't have that skill, you gain it at level-0. If you have it at
level-0, it becomes level-1. And if you already have it at level-1,
pick any other non-psychic skill instead that isn't already level-1.

The focus you pick or roll tells you a lot about your hero's past. A
smooth Expert who's a Connected Diplomat might have been an underworld
fixer, while a Healer with Specialization in Talk could have been a
psychiatrist or therapist. Take a moment to figure out how your hero's
foci reflect their past experience.

## Now It's Time for a Few Final Touches

Pick or roll a bonus skill. You can use the table to the right or just
choose any non-psychic skill to add at level-0 to your hero. You can
pick a skill you already have at level-0 to make it level-1 instead.

If you're playing a Psychic, note down your beginning maximum Effort,
which is equal to 1 plus your highest psychic skill plus the better of
your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.

Write down your saving throws. Your Physical saving throw is equal to
15 minus your Strength or Constitution modifiers, whichever is
better. Your Evasion saving throw is equal to 15 minus the better of
your Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers, and your Mental saving throw
is 15 minus the better of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.

Pick your starting equipment, either rolling 2d6 x 100 to find your
beginning credit total or picking a package from [here](#equipment-packages). Note down your
beginning hit bonus totals and damage for any weapons you have, and
the Armor Class total for any armor you wear.

Finally, put a name on this budding hero and choose their initial
goal. What are they trying to accomplish right now? Get rich? Get off
their tedious homeworld? Take revenge on a local tyrant? Whatever you
pick should be something that motivates your hero from the very start,
and it should also be something that complements the interests of the
rest of the players. Nobody's going to thank you if you roll up a PC
that none of the other party members would want to associate with, or
one that can't be expected to play nicely with the rest of the group.

# Psionics

Psionic powers first manifested centuries ago in the wake of the first
interstellar flights. Later paraphysicists speculated that something
about the exposure to metadimensional energies incurred in spike drive
travel changed these spacers, altering genomes or warping their energy
shadows in a way that changed their eventual offspring. While this
theory was never completely proven, it was demonstrated that psionic
powers were far more prevalent on the frontier, in people who were
descended of starfaring ancestors, than they were on Old Terra. On
most frontier worlds about one in ten thousand children are born with
psychic aptitude, while Old Terra displayed only a tenth of that
incidence.

Psychic abilities initially seemed to be a congenital curse, one known
as “Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome”, or MES. Children
manifested MES in puberty or early adulthood, after certain critical
stages of brain development opened a channel between their minds and
the churning maelstrom of energies that boiled in metadimensional
space. By a conscious or unconscious act of will, they could release
these energies in various forms. Even so, the passage of unmediated
metadimensional force through unprotected neural tissue almost
invariably caused brain damage. Repeated use of these abilities caused
crippling disability, death, or madness. Most psychics were dead
within a few years after manifesting. A few were able to control their
powers sufficiently to prevent accidental discharges, but safe,
controlled use of these abilities was unknown.

In response, the Terran Mandate initiated the Psionic Authority,
basing it on a terraformed Mars. Children from throughout Mandate
space were carefully selected by the Authority and brought to the
institute in order to study and hopefully cure this tragic
condition. Persistent legends speak of horrible experiments and
ruthless sacrifices of “test subjects”, but no proof of such evil ever
emerged, and after decades of study, the Psionic Authority was
actually able to produce protocols that allowed controlled, safe
employment of psionic powers.

The bloom of psitech development that followed and the wonders of jump
gates and the Second Wave of human expansion are a matter of
history. So too is the Scream that erupted six centuries ago and
granted every living psychic in human space either violent madness or
instant death. The interstellar societal collapse that followed and
the centuries-long Silence between the stars has been a matter of
living memory for many ill-connected frontier worlds.

With the Scream and the death or madness of every potential psychic
tutor, psionics became the horror it once was generations
ago. Untrained psychics suffer under the lash of their own abilities,
doomed to early death if they aren't fortunate enough to fumble into a
means of damping their own powers. Men and women of some worlds now
fear psychics, not only for the ancestral memory of the Scream and the
chaos that followed, but also because their only experience with these
unfortunates has been one of uncontrolled power, madness, and death.

In the past few centuries, however, a few worlds have managed to
resuscitate the ancient psychic protocols and develop metapsionic
tutors skilled enough to train new psychics. For some, it was the
fruit of some discovered pretech wonder that damped psychic energies
enough to safely experiment. For others, it was the product of coldly
ruthless experimentation on disposable psychic test victims. A few
worlds even retained some shreds of psychic mastery from the ancient
days, the result of a Scream victim who was lucid enough to teach
pupils, though usually for some demented or horrible end. Whatever the
source, these institutions provide desperately-desired training for
those few afflicted with MES.

These “psychic academies” are scattered widely throughout the sectors
of space, usually based out of some amenable planetary polity or
defensible deepspace habitat. Some academies are exclusively for the
use of a particular nation or planet, while others will accept anyone
who can pay the tuition or satisfy the interests of their
patrons. Most are powerful players in the local political scene,
offering services that mean life and death to MES sufferers and
producing graduates who are extremely useful to local rulers. Others
need to operate in secret, avoiding the fearful attention of
populations that neither accept nor trust their powers.


<a id="psychic-characters-and-training"></a>

## Psychic Characters and Training

All Psychic PCs are assumed to have had some sort of training. They
may have received their education at a world-famous psychic academy on
their homeworld, or been taught in secret by a peripatetic psychic
mentor, but only one in a million psychics has the blind luck and
natural aptitude to develop an intuitive control of their MES. Of
course, it may be that your PC was that one in a million, but you'll
want to discuss it with your GM.

Psychic training requires from one to four years to complete,
depending on the aptitude of the pupil and the amount of training
support they get from other psychics. Most academies have one or more
“deans” who actually have the metapsionic abilities to dampen and
buffer novice minds. Regular application of their abilities to the
pupils allows the students to safely practice and train with their
powers until they've mastered the channeling of the energies. Aside
from these deans, additional psychic tutors can speed the learning
process by demonstrations, technical critique, and “encouragement” of
various kinds.

On worlds where psionics are outlawed or feared, most MES sufferers
learn to either conceal their powers or accept swift euthanasia or
exile from a society that dreads their abilities. Most are unable to
do this; their innate abilities boil out at some inopportune time, and
their true nature is revealed to their grieving family and
neighbors. Those who do learn to contain their abilities can go their
whole lives unsuspected. A few receive secret teachings from wandering
adepts, ones who can quickly show them how to suppress their
powers. The best and most promising might be taken as full students by
these adepts, shown how to master their own abilities and eventually
teach others as well.

On planets where psionic powers are less terrifying there is always at
least one psychic academy in the solar system that invites
pupils. Some charge exorbitant tuition, but most are supported by
governments, private organizations, or successful graduates. Students
are expected to pay for their training one way or another, however; if
not in credits, then in service to the patron on completion of the
training. Many psychics with decidedly non-academic Backgrounds
acquired their experience in the mandatory service period after their
graduation. Most psychic PCs will have left such duties behind by the
time they start adventuring, though a few of them may have departed
considerably in advance of their expected release date.


<a id="psionic-skills"></a>

## Psionic Skills

Psionic powers are divided up into ***disciplines***, each of which has
a corresponding skill. Someone with a basic, functioning expertise in
the skill has level-0, while a true master of the art would have
level-4. Only psychics can learn psionic skills, and they are most
often taught at rigidly-disciplined psychic academies. Attempting to
develop these skills without such formalized training is almost
invariably lethal to the experimenter, though an exceedingly few
natural prodigies sometimes intuitively grasp their principles. Even
fewer of these gifted naturals are able to express their understanding
in a coherent, teachable form.

Some psychics are “unrestricted”. While they usually have a distinct
aptitude for one or two disciplines, they can theoretically learn any
of them, and may raise any psionic skill they choose. Any character
with the Psychic class is an unrestricted psychic. Others demonstrate
gifts in only one discipline. While they can eventually master all
aspects of that power, they can't raise any other psychic
skill. Adventurers with the Partial Psychic class option are such
“restricted” psychics.

Attempting to wield a natural psionic aptitude without proper
precautions will almost inevitably cause death or madness, as the
uncontrolled cascade of MES energies will cause varying forms of
permanent brain damage. Untrained psychics can sometimes get away with
using their powers very rarely, but these natural prodigies rarely
have any ability beyond level-1 in a discipline. Those who use their
powers often enough to gain more practical field experience can expect
to end up dead, crippled, or insane.


<a id="psionic-powers-and-techniques"></a>

## Psionic Powers and Techniques

Every psychic who obtains level-0 proficiency in a discipline gains
access to its core ***technique***. This technique varies depending on
the discipline, whether it's physical translocation with Teleportation
or tissue repair with Biopsionics. The strength of the ability varies
with the practitioner's skill level; the *Psychic Succor* provided by
a biopsionicist with level-0 proficiency is much weaker than that
provided by someone with level-4 expertise. Core techniques improve
naturally as the psychic improves their skill level. They do not need
to be purchased with skill points or otherwise specially trained.

As a psychic improves their skill level in a discipline, they may also
learn other techniques, special tricks and abilities they've refined
through practice. Each time they improve a skill level, they can pick
a new technique from that discipline. Most techniques have a minimum
skill level associated with them, and the PC can't pick a technique
which requires a higher skill level than they've mastered. They also
cannot “save” technique picks for later, either. They must be chosen
immediately after improving the skill.

The techniques listed under the disciplines here are commonly-known
arts that are part of the basic curriculum of most competent psychic
academies. No special training is required to choose them when a PC is
able to pick a new technique, as the principles were taught as part of
their basic education. Other techniques exist that are more esoteric
in nature, and may require a trainer to educate the PC in their
principles before they can be learned.

Even so, some of the standard techniques might be selectively
restricted by an academy, taught only to certain pupils. In some
cases, this may be due to a sponsor's restrictions on what kind of
abilities they want the local psychics to possess, while other
academies might consider them fundamentally immoral abilities. Control
over the metapsionic technique of psychic tutoring is particularly
strict, as any pupil who has its rudiments included in their
curriculum may eventually be able to train other psychics in turn. A
PC may have to go to significant lengths in order to patch the holes
in a government-controlled psychic curriculum.

PCs who want to learn additional techniques beyond those acquired by
improving their skills may buy them separately with skill points,
paying one point per level of the technique. PCs who want to retrain
techniques may do so at the GM's discretion, usually only when they
encounter some new esoteric technique they'd like to learn in place of
an existing art. Techniques can only be retrained into others of equal
or lower required skill level.

It may be possible for a psychic to create entirely new techniques to
reflect their personal aptitudes and special inclinations. Any such
novelty is strictly at the GM's discretion, and unlikely to be done
more than once or twice over the lifetime of even the most skilled
psychic experimenter.


<a id="effort-and-psychic-abilities"></a>

## Effort and Psychic Abilities

Psionic powers are fueled by ***Effort***, a measure of the psychic's
mental focus, energy, and neural responsiveness. A psychic's maximum
Effort total is equal to one plus the higher of their Wisdom or
Constitution attribute modifiers, plus their highest psychic skill
score. Thus, a psychic with a Wisdom modifier of -1, a Constitution
modifier of +2, and psionic skills of Metapsionics-0 and Biopsionics-0
would have a maximum Effort score of 3. If he were to then improve his
Biopsionics skill to level-1, his Effort would become 4.

Effort is “Committed” to fuel a psionic power. Some Commitment is
relatively short-term, lasting only as long as the power is in
effect. Other powers require that the Effort be Committed for the full
scene, while the most powerful might require it be Committed for the
rest of the day. Once the Commitment period is over, the Effort
returns to the psychic. All Effort is refreshed after a good night's
rest.

Whenever a power requires you to Commit Effort, you commit only one
point, though additional effects or triggerings may require separate
Commitments.


<a id="torching"></a>

## Torching

Psychics can push past their limits by “torching”, intentionally
ignoring safety protocols and neural refractory periods to channel MES
energy beyond their normal capacity. For untrained MES subjects, *all*
their power use qualifies as torching, as they lack the training
necessary to develop safe reserves of Effort.

Torching is an Instant action that can be performed once per round. It
provides a free point of Effort that lasts for the rest of the scene,
even if this point puts a psychic over the maximum allowed. Every time
the psychic torches, however, they have to roll on the torching result
table below.

</table>

Psychics reduced below a Wisdom score of 3 go violently insane and
become “feral psychics”; those reduced below scores of 3 in other
attributes likewise become dead or nonviable as player characters.

There is no available cure for brain damage caused by torching, and
even advanced pretech technology has no generally-known remedy.

Feral psychics are exceptionally dangerous, as their form of brain
damage invariably results in violent, psychotic behavior and
terrifying hallucinations. Worse still, they can torch with impunity
thereafter, as the MES energies have already burnt a clear path
through what remains of their sanity. Feral psychics have effectively
unlimited Effort with what powers they have obtained. There is no
known cure for a feral psychic.


<a id="attitudes-toward-psychics"></a>

## Attitudes Toward Psychics

Most worlds have a warily accepting attitude toward psionic
abilities. Provided they've received appropriate training, a psychic
can live and work in relative peace. They are not normally required to
wear any sort of external badge or marking, and they are entitled to
keep their own abilities private from anyone but the government if
they so wish. They may be subject to mandatory “national service”,
depending on the polity, and their special abilities might be
impressed by the government in cases of extreme need, but they are
able to live a relatively normal, if very well-remunerated
life. Ordinary men and women have only a vague understanding of
psychic powers, but they understand enough to know the basic types of
disciplines and the sort of effects each can produce.

Other worlds have a warmer attitude towards psychics. Those gifted
with MES are elevated above the ordinary rabble, their abilities
celebrated and directed toward the advantage of their
communities. Such societies often have psychic ability as a
prerequisite for substantial authority, and have worked precognitive
visions or telepathic scans into the ordinary fabric of life. Offworld
psychics tend to be treated with considerable respect on these worlds,
though sometimes they're also expected to provide services or guidance
they may not be equipped to give. Citizens of these worlds usually
have an excellent understanding of how psychic disciplines work, in
addition to understanding ways to counter them.

A few worlds have outright hostility towards psychics and their
abilities. MES sufferers might be viewed as pitiable victims of a
lethal affliction they can't control, but trained and capable psychics
are threats to be wiped out. Their telepathic probings, cheating
foresight, and impossibly elusive teleportation makes them a menace to
normal human beings, and society cannot tolerate their existence. Some
worlds forbid psionics out of fear of another Scream, while others do
so out of misunderstandings, a desire for social stability, or local
conditions that make psionic powers exceptionally dangerous. A few of
these worlds have private psychic academies to train psionic myrmidons
for the ruling class or deniable agents of private intrigue.

On almost all worlds, however, psychics can expect to suffer
considerably harsher legal penalties than conventional criminals. Some
worlds simply have no resources to jail an unwilling teleporter or
mind-reading telepath, while others expect those of great gifts to
have correspondingly great virtue. It's not unknown for psychics to
face summary execution for crimes that would earn other malefactors a
simple jail sentence.

A few worlds have ancient pretech artifacts or technologies that are
capable of defeating or suppressing psychic powers. Such resources are
always extremely rare, and normally only deployed to protect heads of
state and similar top-level figures, along with government sites of
planetary importance.


<a id="biopsionics"></a>

# Biopsionics

Biopsionic powers repair, augment, debilitate, or damage living
creatures. Unless otherwise specified the biopsionicist must be able
to touch a target, though clothing and armor do not interfere with the
use of these abilities. Touching a willing or unsuspecting target is
automatic, whereas touching a resisting target requires a normal Punch
hit roll with a bonus equal to the practitioner's Biopsionics
skill. Such touch effects do not inflict the normal damage of a Punch
attack.

Unsurprisingly, biopsionic powers are among the most accepted psychic
abilities. Even a modestly-experienced biopsion can perform miracles
of healing for a community lucky enough to have their services.


<a id="system-strain"></a>

## System Strain

Many curative biopsionic powers add to the target's ***System
Strain***. System Strain is a measure of the amount of system stress,
intrusive modification, and general biological distress an organism
might be suffering. Psionic healing, cybernetic implants, and powerful
drugs all add to a target's System Strain.

If using a power or drug on a target would make their System Strain
exceed their Constitution score, the effect fails to function; their
body simply cannot adapt to the changes and cannot benefit from them.

System Strain decreases automatically by one point after each night of
rest, provided the organism is well-fed and not compromised by
sickness or privation.


<a id="biopsionics-psychic-succor"></a>

### Core Technique - Psychic Succor

The adept's touch stabilizes critically-wounded organisms. More
sophisticated practitioners can heal tissue injuries, though curing
diseases, detoxifying poisons, and fixing congenital deformities
require additional techniques. Each use of *Psychic Succor* adds one
point of System Strain to the target, or two points if they were
mortally wounded at the time.

Activating *Psychic Succor* requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for
the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the rest of that
scene without Committing Effort again.

-   ***Level-0:*** The psychic's touch can automatically stabilize a
    mortally-wounded target as a Main Action. This power must be used on
    a target within six rounds of their collapse, and does not function
    on targets that have been decapitated or killed by Heavy
    weapons. It's the GM's decision as to whether a target is intact
    enough for this power to work.

-   ***Level-1:*** As level-0, and heal 1d6+1 hit points of damage. If
    used on a mortally-wounded target, they revive with the rolled hit
    points and can act normally on the next round.

-   ***Level-2:*** As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 hit points instead.

-   ***Level-3:*** As level-2, but healing 2d6+6 hit points instead.

-   ***Level-4:*** As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 hit points instead.


<a id="biopsionics-mastered-succor"></a>

### Mastered Succor     :level_1:

The biopsion has developed a sophisticated mastery of their core
ability, and they no longer need to Commit Effort to activate it, and
may use it whenever they wish. The use of additional techniques that
augment *Psychic Succor* might still require Effort to be Committed.


<a id="biopsionics-organic-purification-protocols"></a>

### Organic Purification Protocols     :level_1:

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* now cures any poisons or diseases the
subject may be suffering, albeit it requires Committing Effort for the
day as an additional surcharge. Biowarfare organisms, exceptionally
virulent diseases, or TL5 toxins may resist this curing, requiring a
Wis/Biopsionics skill check at a difficulty of at least 10. Failure
means that the adept cannot cure the target's disease. This technique
cannot cure congenital illnesses.


<a id="biopsionics-remote-repair"></a>

### Remote Repair     :level_1:

*Psychic Succor* and other biopsionic techniques that normally require
touch contact can now be applied at a distance up to 100 meters,
provided the biopsion can see the target with their unaided
vision. Hostile powers that normally require a hit roll will hit
automatically. Each time this technique is used, Effort must be
Committed for the scene.


<a id="biopsionics-invincible-stand"></a>

### Invincible Stand     :level_2:

The biopsion has mastered techniques of emergency tissue reinforcement
and system stabilization. As an Instant action, they can Commit Effort
for the scene to keep themself or a target they can touch active even
at zero hit points. This technique must be used once every round on
the target or they collapse at the end of the round. If the target
suffers hit point damage, the biopsion must Instantly Commit Effort
for the scene or the target goes down immediately with a mortal
wound. A Heavy weapon hit on a subject of this power or similar
physical dismemberment will always kill a target, regardless of this
technique.


<a id="biopsionics-major-organ-restoration"></a>

### Major Organ Restoration     :level_2:

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* can now cure congenital birth defects
and regrow missing limbs and organs. It can even be used to stabilize
targets that have been dropped by Heavy weapons, decapitated, or
otherwise dramatically dismembered, provided it's used within one
round per level of Biopsionic skill. The best that can be done for
such badly-mangled targets is stabilization, after which they must
rest for 24 hours before any further hit points can be healed by
Biopsionics, stims, or natural rest.


<a id="biopsionics-tissue-integrity-field"></a>

### Tissue Integrity Field     :level_2:

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* may now also affect all allies within
ten meters of the target. Allies can decline the healing if they don't
require it or don't want to take the additional System Strain. Each
use of this technique requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for the
day in addition to the cost of the *Psychic Succor*.


<a id="biopsionics-accelerated-succor"></a>

### Accelerated Succor     :level_3:

The biopsion's *Psychic Succor* now can be used as an On Turn power,
albeit only once per round. By Committing an additional Effort for the
day with each use, it can even be used as an Instant power, though it
still can only be used once per round. Any surcharges for augmenting
the succor apply normally, such as with *Tissue Integrity Field*.


<a id="biopsionics-metamorph"></a>

### Metamorph     :level_3:

The biopsion can now shape their own or another willing target's
physical form as a Main Action, transforming a touched target into any
humanoid form within 50% of their own mass. Claws and other body
armaments can be fashioned equivalent to Light or Medium melee weapons
and innate armor equivalent to AC 13. Gills and other
environmental-survival alterations are also viable at the GM's
discretion, but flight is a bridge too far for this power.

A person can be impersonated down to the DNA level, provided a blood
or hair sample is available. The use of this adds one System Strain
point to the target that does not recover so long as the change is in
effect. Applying *Metamorph* requires that the biopsion Commit Effort
for as long as the change is to be maintained. If applied to a target
other than the psychic, the power automatically ends if the psychic
gets more than one hundred kilometers away.


<a id="biopsionics-teratic-overload"></a>

### Teratic Overload     :level_3:

This use of biopsionics inflicts potentially-lethal damage on a
touched target as a Main Action, and requires that the biopsion Commit
Effort for the scene. The target suffers 1d6 damage per level of the
psychic's Biopsionics skill and must make a Physical saving throw. On
a failure, the damage is tripled and the target is now affected by an
obvious, lethal cancer that will kill them in 1d6 months. The cancer
can be treated by a TL4 hospital or ship's sick bay if managed within
a month's time. If the biopsion Commits Effort for the day instead of
the scene, they can control the power sufficiently to do no hit point
damage and create very subtle tumors, leaving the cancer undetectable
without a TL4 medical examination. Such victims probably won't even
know they've been attacked by this power. Whether a success or
failure, this power cannot be used on the same target more than once
per scene.


<a id="biopsionics-holistic-optimization-patterning"></a>

### Holistic Optimization Patterning     :level_4:

The biopsion gains the ability to drastically augment their own or a
touched ally's physical abilities as an On Turn action. This boost
lasts for the rest of the scene, adds two points of System Strain to
the target and gives them a +2 bonus to all Strength or Dexterity
skill checks, hit rolls, and damage rolls along with 20 extra hit
points. Any damage is taken off these temporary hit points first, and
both the bonuses and any hit points in excess of the target's maximum
are lost at the end of the scene. Each invocation of this technique
requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day, and this power
cannot be used on a given target more than once per scene.


<a id="biopsionics-quintessential-reconstruction"></a>

### Quintessential Reconstruction     :level_4:

The biopsion becomes extremely difficult to kill, encoding their mind
in a coherent pattern of MES energy coterminous with their realspace
coordinates. If killed, the psychic will regenerate from the largest
remaining fragment of their body over 24 hours. This process maximizes
their System Strain for one week. If brought to zero hit points during
this week, they die instantly and permanently. The psychic retains a
vague awareness of their surroundings while “dead” and can postpone
their regeneration for up to a week in order to avoid notice, but
burial or entombment may result in a very short second life. Each use
of this power inflicts one point of permanent attribute loss in an
attribute of the biopsion's choice.


<a id="sidebar-biopsionics-and-hospitals"></a>

# Biopsionics and Hospitals

Biopsionics is a spectacularly effective discipline for curing
physical injuries and sicknesses, but its use for the latter is capped
by the biopsion's available Effort. Hospitals on worlds with access to
psychic academies often have several biopsions on staff, proficient
with the requisite techniques and capable of quickly healing
tremendous amounts of trauma injuries on short notice.

Assuming one proficient and available biopsion for every 100,000
citizens, however, the total amount of sickness-curing ability is
going to be very limited, and likely reserved for the powerful and
wealthy. The vanishingly few psychics who are master metapsions
capable of the *Flawless Mastery* of *Organic Purification Protocols*
can easily command as much as two thousand credits a day just for
temporary work at a grateful hospital.

Ordinary PC biopsions who want to pick up some extra work curing
sicknesses can usually find temp employment with a local medical
facility for 50 credits per day per Effort point they have. Note that
some patients may be *very upset* if the hospital fails to assign them
the PC's limited Effort.


<a id="metapsionics"></a>

# Metapsionics

Metapsionics is the rarest and most esoteric of the psychic
disciplines, with few psychics having the necessary temperament or
interest in developing these complex abilities. A metapsion controls
psychic energy itself, molding and shaping the flows of energy that
spill through the brains of those marked by MES.

Taken in isolation, metapsionics allows a psychic to increase the raw
Effort available to them and become more flexible in how this Effort
is used. Expert metapsions can even teach other potential psychics how
to control and channel their new abilities, and the services of a
trained psychic mentor command considerable sums in most systems.

Beyond this, in most stellar sectors a competent metapsion is the only
practical way to protect a target from undetectable psychic
assault. Without a vigilant brainguard, a head of state, interstellar
celebrity, or planetary oligarch might find their minds rifled
effortlessly by some undetected psychic intruder.

As a consequence, many metapsions become much more physically
competent and better-trained in combat than the average psychic. The
high prices they can command as brainguards attract some, though
others find their clients too aggravating to endure for long.


<a id="metapsionics-psychic-refinement"></a>

## Core Technique - Psychic Refinement

The metapsion gains improved mastery over their own powers and an
innate sensitivity to the use of psionic abilities in their presence.

-   ***Level-0:*** The adept can visually and audibly detect the use of
    psychic powers. If both the source and target are visible to the
    metapsion, they can tell who's using the power, even if it's
    normally imperceptible. They gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw
    versus a psionic power.

-   ***Level-1:*** The metapsion's maximum Effort increases by an
    additional point.

-   ***Level-2:*** The adept can determine whether or not a person is a
    psychic or has latent psionic abilities through one round of visual
    inspection. Their saving throw bonus against psionic powers
    increases to +3.

-   ***Level-3:*** The metapsion's maximum Effort increases by an
    additional point.

-   ***Level-4:*** The metapsion can perform a slightly safer version of
    torching. Instead of rolling the torching damage die, they simply
    suffer 10 hit points of damage after torching is used. The damage
    occurs after the fueled power activates, allowing a psychic at low
    hit points to trigger a power before falling unconscious. This
    damage cannot be healed by anything but natural bed rest, though a
    psychic can be stabilized if this technique drops her to zero hit
    points.


<a id="metapsionics-cloak-powers"></a>

### Cloak Powers     :level_1:

The metapsion can conceal their own psychic abilities from metapsionic
senses. They must Commit Effort for as long as they wish to cloak
their powers. While hidden, only a metapsion with equal or higher
skill in Metapsionics can detect their abilities with their level-0 or
level-2 *Psychic Refinement* abilities. In such cases, an opposed
Wis/Metapsionics roll is made between the metapsion and the
investigator. If the investigator wins, the cloak is pierced, while if
the metapsion wins, the investigator's *Psychic Refinement* remains
oblivious.


<a id="metapsionics-mindtracing"></a>

### Mindtracing     :level_1:

The metapsion can trace back the use of psionic powers they've noticed
in their presence. By Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant
action, they can see and hear through the senses of a user of a
psychic power, gaining an intuitive awareness of their location and
treating them as a visible target for purposes of their own
abilities. Thus, if they see someone being affected by a telepathy
power with no visible source, they can use this ability to briefly
share the hidden telepath's senses. If used on a target that is
teleporting, they can perceive the teleporter's view of their
destination. Use on a metamorphically-shaped impostor would reveal the
biopsion responsible for the change, and so forth. These shared senses
last for only one round and do not interfere with the adept's other
actions.


<a id="metapsionics-synthetic-adaptation"></a>

### Synthetic Adaptation     :level_1:

This is a particularly esoteric technique, one that requires the adept
to have at least Program-0 or Fix-0 skill in order to master. With it,
however, the metapsion has learned how to synergize with the quantum
intelligence of a VI or True AI in order to apply Telepathy or
Biopsion powers to their inanimate corpus. Only intelligent machines
can be affected, as the technique requires a sentient mind to catalyze
the effect.

This synergy takes much of its force from the adept. Any System Strain
the powers might inflict must be paid by the adept rather than the
target.


<a id="metapsionics-neural-trap"></a>

### Neural Trap     :level_2:

The metapsion allows a hostile psychic into their mental sanctum in
order to gain a later advantage. When targeted by a hostile psionic
power that allows a save, the metapsion may Commit Effort as an
Instant action and voluntarily fail the saving throw, accepting the
effect. The next psychic power the user targets at that assailant then
allows the victim no saving throw. This technique lasts until the
metapsion makes their psychic attack or reclaims their Committed
Effort. A hostile psychic may be affected by only one *Neural Trap*
from a given psychic at a time.


<a id="metapsionics-psychic-static"></a>

### Psychic Static     :level_2:

As an Instant action, the metapsion may Commit Effort for the day to
negate a perceived psychic power. The psychic responsible for the
effect must Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to resist
this negation, otherwise the power ends and any action used to trigger
it is wasted. The PC may then Commit Effort for the day again, with
each spending and counter-spending until one runs out of Effort or
chooses to stop. *Psychic Static* can be applied only once per round
to any particular power. The target of the *Psychic Static*
automatically knows the position of the interfering metapsion, though
other onlookers do not have any obvious way of identifying the
metapsion.


<a id="metapsionics-suspended-manifestation"></a>

### Suspended Manifestation     :level_2:

The metapsion is capable of “hanging” a psychic power in their brain,
forming the energy patterns and then suspending them in a
self-sustaining loop until it's time to trigger their release. The
psychic must Commit Effort for the day to hang a power, along with the
Effort normally necessary to trigger it. None of this Effort can be
recovered until the power is expended, after which it recovers at its
usual speed. Activating the power is an Instant action, or an On Turn
action if it allows the target a saving throw of some kind. Only one
ability can be held suspended at any one time.


<a id="metapsionics-concert-of-minds"></a>

### Concert of Minds     :level_3:

As an On Turn action, the metapsion may Commit Effort and form a
psychic gestalt with one or more willing psychics within three meters,
including up to one other psychic per Metapsion skill level. This
gestalt persists as long as the Effort remains committed, regardless
of the subsequent distance between psychics. On their own turn, any
member of the gestalt may use any power or technique known by any
other member, using the other member's skill levels as necessary and
paying any Effort cost from their own pool. This gestalt shares only
psychic power, not thoughts or senses. At the end of each round in
which one or more members have used some other member's powers or
abilities on their turn of action, the metapsion must Commit Effort
for the scene or the gestalt drops and cannot be re-established for
the rest of the scene.


<a id="metapsionics-metadimensional-friction"></a>

### Metadimensional Friction     :level_3:

As a Main Action, the metapsion Commits Effort for the scene to create
localized MES turbulence around a visible target psychic within 200
meters. Each time the target Commits Effort or an NPC initiates a
psychic power, they suffer 1d8 damage per Metapsionics skill level of
the adept. Each time the target suffers the damage they can attempt a
Mental saving throw to throw off the effect. It lasts no longer than
the rest of the scene at most. Only one application of this friction
can affect a target at once.


<a id="metapsionics-psychic-tutelage"></a>

### Psychic Tutelage     :level_3:

An expert metapsion can modulate and temper the metadimensional energy
that surges through an untrained psychic's mind. This “safety buffer”
allows the novice to experiment with their abilities and gradually
develop the control they need to channel their powers without causing
permanent brain damage. Without this technique, it is virtually
impossible to turn a normal with untapped potential into a trained
psychic.

An adept with Metapsionics-3 skill can train up to ten pupils at
once. One with Metapsionics-4 can train up to one hundred. It requires
only a week to train a potential in ways to avoid accidentally
triggering their powers and suffering the damage that follows, but
actually teaching them to use their powers effectively takes anywhere
from one to four years depending on their natural aptitude and the
availability of other psychics willing to assist the metapsion in the
training process.


<a id="metapsionics-surge-momentum"></a>

### Surge Momentum     :level_3:

The metapsion's abilities can be reinforced with a degree of
metadimensional energy that would cause substantial damage to a less
adept mind. Particularly weak or unprepared minds might be completely
crushed by the force of the adept's augmented will.

The adept must Commit Effort for the day when using a power that
normally grants its target a saving throw. The target then suffers a
penalty equal to the adept's Metapsionics skill on any saving throw
normally granted by the power. If the target's hit die total or
character level is less than half the adept's level, rounded up, they
automatically fail their saving throw.


<a id="metapsionics-flawless-mastery"></a>

### Flawless Mastery     :level_4:

When this technique is learned, the adept may choose one technique
from any discipline they know. That technique no longer requires
Effort to be Committed in any way, though other techniques that
augment it may still exact a cost. Mastered *Psychic Static*, for
example, can expend an effectively unlimited amount of effort. If the
technique has a duration based on Committed Effort then it lasts until
the metapsion chooses to end it or is killed. This technique may only
be mastered once, though the perfected technique may be changed with a
month of meditation and practice.


<a id="metapsionics-impervious-pavis-of-will"></a>

### Impervious Pavis of Will     :level_4:

When this technique is learned, the metapsion must choose a
discipline. They then become entirely immune to unwanted powers from
that discipline; they and their abilities are simply not valid targets
for purposes of that discipline's powers unless the adept chooses to
be affected. By Committing Effort for the day as an Instant action,
they can extend this immunity for a scene to all allies within 50
meters. This technique may be learned more than once, and any shared
protection applies to all disciplines negated by the adept.


<a id="precognition"></a>

# Precognition

The discipline of Precognition relates to sensing the cascade of
future events and reading the achronal chaos of the metadimensional
energy that ripples in the psychic's brain. Readings provided by
Precognition tend to be focused on the psychic and what they find
interesting or important. Matters irrelevant to the seer are unlikely
to be noticed, even if they are of critical importance to those
involved. More advanced techniques of Precognition can even influence
the future, adjusting probabilities by changing or pruning certain
metadimensional currents.

The future is not carved in stone. Oracles can be falsified by present
action or sheer random chance. When a reading is ambiguous or the
future seems uncertain, the GM should simply give the most probable
reading for the power as their own judgment recommends.

Precognition is strictly future-oriented. For assorted complex
reasons, the past is vastly more difficult to observe with psionic
powers, and postcognition is generally considered impossible.

Precogs are generally viewed with considerable unease by the general
population. They're not as widely feared as telepaths, but the uncanny
powers of foresight they possess can make them difficult company. They
can earn very substantial sums of money from those desperate to learn
of some future outcome, but the specificity of their visions makes it
difficult for them to perceive large-scale future events.

A precog can see a city in flames or a stock market board showing a
crash, but even the most powerful can't tell if the conflagration is
just a limited local disaster or a planet-consuming catastrophe, nor
can they tell if the crash is a temporary pullback in the market or a
harbinger of global depression. Many precogs have difficulty dealing
with this ambiguity, and some become fixed on personal interpretations
of their visions that may or may not play out as they have seen.


<a id="precognition-bending-the-future"></a>

## Bending the Future

Everything a precog sees is provisional. Some outcomes may be so
likely as to be nigh-certain, but nothing is truly, absolutely
destined. Vigorous activity or simple unexpected chance can skew
future outcomes.

This effect is one reason why choirs of precogs have not been more
widely exploited by planetary governments. The clearer and more
detailed a future outcome becomes, the simpler it is to find the
crucial events that can be changed to derail it. The more intense the
precognitive focus toward a future event, the more fluid it becomes as
fresh readings take into account the countermoves that others have
made. Rumors persist of ancient pretech augmentation hardware that can
“fix” future outcomes, but most governments lack the resources to even
consider such extravagance.


<a id="precognition-oracle"></a>

## Core Technique - Oracle

The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of
their own future. Each invocation of the *Oracle* technique requires a
Main Action and that the user Commit Effort for the day. Once
triggered, the adept gets a single brief vision related to the
question about the future that they're asking. This vision is always
from their own personal vantage point and never reveals more than a
minute of insight, though the psychic processes it almost instantly as
part of the power's use.

The GM should answer the question as if the PC were about to perform
the act or engage in the investigation pertinent to the
question. Thus, if the adept wanted to know what pressing a button
would do and the GM knows that it's connected to a bomb, the psychic
might get a vision of sudden death. If the bomb were on a time delay
that extended past the time horizon of the oracle, however, the
psychic might just see a vision of herself waiting patiently, with
nothing happening.

Visions should relate to actions and events, not abstract
facts. *Oracle* couldn't tell a psychic who the crime boss of a slum
neighborhood is, for example, but it could give a vision of the
psychic caught in the next bloody riot and the gang boss who's
directing the myriad thugs. It couldn't reveal the name of a security
guard, but it could show the seer the impending moment that the next
guard patrol will enter the area the psychic plans to infiltrate. Only
the most important or significant information is conveyed by the
technique, even if multiple events of interest might transpire during
the time horizon.

*Oracle* can only be used on a given question or topic once until the
situation changes substantially or a week goes by. The maximum time
horizon of the *Oracle* increases as the adept's Precognition skill
improves.

-   ***Level-0:*** One minute into the future.

-   ***Level-1:*** One day into the future.

-   ***Level-2:*** One week into the future.

-   ***Level-3:*** Three months into the future.

-   ***Level-4:*** One year into the future.


<a id="precognition-intuitive-response"></a>

### Intuitive Response     :level_1:

As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the scene just
before they roll initiative. Their initiative score is treated as one
better than anyone else's involved in the scene. If another
participant has this power or some other ability that grants automatic
initiative success, roll initiative normally to determine which of
them goes first, and then the rest of the combatants act. This ability
cannot be used if the precog has been surprised.


<a id="precognition-sense-the-need"></a>

### Sense the Need     :level_1:

At some point in the recent past, the psychic had a vague but intense
premonition that a particular object would be needed. By triggering
this power as an Instant action and Committing Effort for the day, the
psychic can retroactively declare that they brought along any one
object that they could have reasonably acquired and carried to this
point. This object must be plausible given recent events; if the
psychic has just been strip-searched, very few objects could
reasonably have been kept, while a psychic who's just passed through a
weapons check couldn't still have a loaded laser pistol.


<a id="precognition-terminal-reflection"></a>

### Terminal Reflection     :level_1:

The psychic's *Oracle* power automatically triggers as an Instant
action moments before some unexpected danger or ambush, giving the
precog a brief vision of the impending hazard. This warning comes just
in time to avoid springing a trap or to negate combat surprise for the
precog and their companions. If the psychic does not immediately
Commit Effort for the day, this sense goes numb and this technique
cannot be used for the rest of the day.


<a id="precognition-alternate-outcome"></a>

### Alternate Outcome     :level_2:

The precog can sense impending failure and attempt to salvage the
action. As an Instant action, the precog can target a visible ally or
their own self and Commit Effort for the day to allow the target to
reroll a failed hit roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the
better of the two rolls. This power disrupts delicate lines of
probability, however, and cannot be used on any given target more than
once a day.


<a id="precognition-destinys-shield"></a>

### Destiny's Shield     :level_2:

The precog observes an incoming injury and tries to find an alternate
future in which the attack misses. As an Instant action, the precog
can Commit Effort for the day to force an attacker to reroll a
successful hit roll. This technique only works on attacks against the
psychic's person, not against attacks aimed at a vehicle they're
occupying or harm that doesn't involve an attack roll. If the rerolled
attack still hits, however, the damage done is maximized. This
technique can be used only once per incoming attack.


<a id="precognition-anguished-vision"></a>

### Anguished Vision     :level_3:

The adept's precognition is sophisticated enough to clearly foresee
several seconds into the future. As an Instant action, the psychic may
Commit Effort for the day and declare that what they have just done or
seen is a vision of the immediate future. Time rolls back to the start
of the initiative count in a combat turn, or six seconds earlier if
out of combat. Nothing that happened during that round has really come
to pass yet.

This ability is tremendously draining, and can be used only once per
day.


<a id="precognition-cursed-luck"></a>

### Cursed Luck     :level_3:

Negative probabilities are woven tightly around a visible animate
target, including robots and animals but not including
vehicles. Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and
Committing Effort for the scene. The target must roll any attack
rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws twice and take
the worst result each time. Any attempts to hit the target or damage
dice rolled against it may be rolled twice and the better result
taken. Intelligent targets can make a Mental saving throw at the end
of each round to throw off the effect; this save is not penalized by
the power.


<a id="precognition-forced-outcome"></a>

### Forced Outcome     :level_3:

Through careful manipulation of probability, the adept can influence
random physical events in their vicinity. Triggering this technique
requires a Main Action and Committing Effort for the scene. Any
simple, random mechanical outcome can be completely controlled for the
scene, such as a roulette wheel or the order of a deck of shuffled
cards. Any other physical event in the area that seems
not-entirely-implausible may be made to occur by this technique,
provided it doesn't involve more than a few objects and doesn't
require human involvement. The GM decides what random events are and
are not adequately possible. Anything more than one unusual
coincidence or chance per scene is likely impossible to produce.


<a id="precognition-not-my-time"></a>

### Not My Time     :level_4:

The precog instinctively wrenches the lines of probability away from
futures in which they are about to die. This technique triggers
automatically when the precog is about to die, provided they can
Commit Effort for the day. On triggering, random events somehow
conspire to leave the precog alive, even if outrageous coincidences
and ridiculous luck are required. Provided the precog doesn't
intentionally thrust herself back into danger, their life is secured
for the next few minutes at least, though there's no guarantee the
psychic will survive intact in mind or body. This technique can
trigger no more often than once per week.


<a id="precognition-prophecy"></a>

### Prophecy     :level_4:

The power of the precog extends to dictating future events that
directly involve them. As a Main Action, the precognitive PC may make
one prediction involving their personal future or future condition
within the next year. Provided they take reasonable measures to enable
this prediction, that no direct resistance is mounted by an enemy, and
that the prediction doesn't seem highly improbable to the GM, it will
come to pass. The adept must Commit Effort when this power is used,
and the Effort remains Committed until the prophecy comes to pass or
is abandoned. This ability cannot be used more than once per month and
only one prophecy may be active at a time.


<a id="telekinesis"></a>

# Telekinesis

Telekinetic abilities are something of a mixed blessing to those
psychics who have them. While they are among the least feared and
distrusted of psychic powers, they also produce effects that are not
nearly so widely-demanded as biopsionic healing or metapsionic
brainguarding. A telekinetic must be canny and creative to get the
most from their abilities.

Telekinetic powers are strong but somewhat imprecise. The force they
generate is usually invisible, though a psychic can allow a visible
glow if desired, and the source of the telekinetic manipulation is not
obvious to ordinary senses. Objects being held or worn by a mobile
creature cannot normally be manipulated by telekinesis, nor can
unwilling intelligent targets be directly manipulated. Machines,
including non-sentient robots, can be affected as any other inanimate
object, however. The psychic cannot use this discipline to lift their
own person without special techniques.

Some techniques refer to a “physical attack” or “physical
damage”. This means a straightforward kinetic impact: bullets,
punches, collisions, falls, compressions, or the like. Energy attacks
are not included.


<a id="telekinesis-telekinetic-manipulation"></a>

## Core Technique - Telekinetic Manipulation

The adept may Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to direct
telekinetic force toward an object or person within unaided visual
range or with tactile contact with the psychic. This force isn't
responsive enough to be effective as a weapon without further
refinement of technique, and cannot cause damage to living or mobile
targets. If used to crush or harm immobile unliving objects, it does
1d6 damage per skill level of the psychic per round of focus. Objects
move at 20 meters per round when moved telekinetically.

A telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple rounds without
expending further actions, such as holding a metal platform in place
under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot again activate this
technique on a second object until they release the first.

-   ***Level-0:*** The psychic can exert force as if with one hand and
    their own strength.

-   ***Level-1:*** The psychic can manipulate objects as if with both
    hands and can lift up to two hundred kilograms with this ability.

-   ***Level-2:*** The psychic can lift or manipulate up to four hundred
    kilograms and smash a human-sized hole in structures of light wooden
    construction or lighter as a Main Action.

-   ***Level-3:*** The psychic can manipulate up to eight hundred
    kilograms and can affect as many individual objects at once as they
    have Telekinesis skill levels.

-   ***Level-4:*** The psychic can manipulate up to a metric ton and can
    smash human-sized holes in TL4-constructed exterior walls, light
    stone walls, or similar barriers as a Main Action.


<a id="telekinesis-kinetic-transversal"></a>

### Kinetic Transversal     :level_1:

The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to move freely over
vertical or overhanging surfaces as if they were flat ground, crossing
any solid surface strong enough to bear five kilos of weight. They can
also move over liquids at their full movement rate. This movement
ability lasts as long as the Effort is committed.


<a id="telekinesis-pressure-field"></a>

### Pressure Field     :level_1:

As an Instant action, the adept can manifest a protective force skin
around their person equivalent to a vacc suit, maintaining pressure
and temperature even in hard vacuum conditions. They can ignore
temperatures at a range of plus or minus 100 degrees Celsius and
automatically pressurize thin atmospheres for breathability, or filter
particulates or airborne toxins. By Committing Effort for the scene,
they can shield up to six comrades. This lasts until the user reclaims
the Effort.


<a id="telekinesis-telekinetic-armory"></a>

### Telekinetic Armory     :level_1:

The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to create both
weapons and armor out of telekinetic force. These weapons are treated
as tech level 4 and act as a rifle or any advanced melee
weapon. Attack rolls can use either Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution
modifiers, and may use the Telekinesis skill as the combat skill.

Armor may be created as part of this power, granting the psychic a
base Armor Class equal to 15 plus their Telekinesis skill level. This
armor does not stack with conventional armor, but Dexterity or shields
modify it as usual. The gear continues to exist as long as the psychic
chooses to leave the Effort committed, and they may be invisible or
visible at the psychic's discretion.


<a id="telekinesis-impact-sump"></a>

### Impact Sump     :level_2:

The adept may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to negate
a single instance of physical damage. This ability is too taxing to be
used more than once per day, but as an Instant action, it can be
triggered even after damage is rolled.


<a id="telekinesis-slip-field"></a>

### Slip Field     :level_2:

As a Main Action, the psychic Commits Effort for the scene and
decreases the friction at a point in sight. Up to ten meters in
diameter is affected, making it difficult for enemies to move from
their current position. All chosen targets must make an Evasion saving
throw or fall prone, becoming unable to stand up or move more than a
meter per Move action taken. If used against a ground vehicle, the
driver must make a Dex/Pilot skill check at a difficulty of 8 plus the
adept's Telekinesis skill or go out of control, driving directly
forward for a round and crashing into any obstacles. Targets who save
are immune to this technique for the scene.


<a id="telekinesis-telekinetic-expertise"></a>

### Telekinetic Expertise     :level_2:

The adept has become familiar enough with the manipulation of
telekinetic force that they may now use *Telekinetic Manipulation*
without Committing Effort.


<a id="telekinesis-thermokinesis"></a>

### Thermokinesis     :level_2:

Telekinetic power involves kinetic energy, but a sufficiently
sophisticated grip on motion can be used to agitate the molecules of
an inanimate object and cause it to melt or burst into flame. Similar
focus can chill or freeze such substances.

Applying *Thermokinesis* to a target requires that the adept Commit
Effort for the scene as a Main Action. *Thermokinesis* cannot affect
objects larger than the adept could lift with their *Telekinetic
Manipulation*.

As with other telekinetic powers, this ability does not work on
objects being held or used by intelligent creatures. Non-sentient
robots or other objects with hit points take 1d12 damage per level of
Telekinesis skill each time this technique is applied to them.


<a id="telekinesis-tangible-force-construct"></a>

### Tangible Force Construct     :level_3:

Once per turn, as an On Turn action, the psychic can Commit Effort for
the scene to create a telekinetic force construct at a visible point,
provided it can fit within a three-meter cube. The force construct can
be shaped in any way the psychic wishes, and can remain fixed in its
location without external supports if desired. It is as sturdy as a
TL4 construction and may be visible or invisible at the adept's
choice. The construct lasts until the end of the scene, until the
psychic dispels it, or until it is smashed with 20 points of damage
against AC 15.


<a id="telekinesis-telekinetic-ram"></a>

### Telekinetic Ram     :level_3:

As a Main Action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to
target a tremendous, uncontrolled burst of force at a single target
within sight. This burst requires some time to detonate, however, and
will only go off at the end of the next round. Targets of this
technique are aware of an oppressive, electrical tingling in the air
and are apt to instinctively move; this technique is thus generally
useless against any target that is not entirely immobile, as any
movement of a chosen target disrupts the ram. Once the ram detonates,
however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile civilian vehicle,
create a five-meter hole in anything short of hardened military
fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else as if it were
struck by a Heavy weapon.


<a id="telekinesis-reactive-telekinesis"></a>

### Reactive Telekinesis     :level_3:

As an Instant action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene
whenever an assailant misses them with a physical attack. The attack
is then reflected back against the assailant, who must reroll the
attack against their own person twice. If either roll hits, the
assailant suffers damage from their own attack. If both rolls hit, the
damage is the maximum possible.


<a id="telekinesis-force-puppetry"></a>

### Force Puppetry     :level_4:

As a Main Action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort for the day to
suborn a visible target's mobility, whether robotic, vehicular, or
human, provided it's no larger than a ground car. A sapient victim can
make a Mental saving throw to resist the psychic onslaught; on a
failure, they lose control of their physical actions. If not piloted
by the telekinetic, the target remains motionless or continues on its
current direction of travel. If the telekinetic spends a Main Action
to control them, they can be made to perform any physical action that
is not directly suicidal, using the psychic's skill levels and hit
bonus for any attacks or skill checks they might make. The puppetry
lasts until the end of the scene, until the target leaves the
psychic's sight, or until a sapient target believes that their action
or inaction is about to get them killed. The psychic's control is fine
enough to achieve even very delicate physical motions, but it is not
good enough to control the target's speech, though it can keep them
silent.


<a id="telekinesis-telekinetic-flight"></a>

### Telekinetic Flight     :level_4:

As an Instant action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort to begin
flying, and may extend this effect to up to a half-dozen unresisting,
human-sized allies within 30 meters. While flying, the psychic can
move at twice their normal movement rate in any direction They can
plunge earthward at up to terminal velocity without harm, and even
orbital insertions are survivable with this power if a vacc suit is
available or the *Pressure Field* technique is used. Allies must end
their turns within 30 meters of the psychic to maintain this flight
but control their own motion. As an Instant, this power may be
triggered in time to negate falling damage. The flight lasts for as
long as the Effort remains Committed.


<a id="sidebar-bot-scrapping"></a>

## Bot Scrapping

While telekinetic powers can't normally be used to harm an intelligent
target without a special technique, non-sentient robots have no such
protection. A VI or True AI can create enough metadimensional static
with their cognition to prevent harm from telekinesis, but ordinary
guard bots, servitor droids, or warbots are extremely susceptible to
telekinetic destruction.

In most cases, this is as simple a matter as telekinetically lifting
and then dropping the bot. A psychic can destroy as many such bots in
a round as they can telekinetically manipulate; one for most, or three
or four at higher skill levels. This also assumes the psychic can lift
the bot's weight.

Some military bots may be resilient enough to handle this battering,
suffering 1d10 damage per level of Telekinesis skill the psychic
possesses. Most have no such chance of survival.


<a id="telepathy"></a>

# Telepathy

There is no psychic power more threatening and disturbing to normal
humanity than that of telepathy. The prospect of having one's
innermost thoughts and secrets pried out by imperceptible means is
deeply troubling to most men and women, and telepaths are often given
a wide berth by others simply for fear of what private thoughts they
might sift out.

Some worlds that are otherwise accepting of psychic powers go so far
as to ban known telepaths and forbid the teaching of the discipline
within their territory. Even those few that do, however, can rarely
resist the urge to maintain some “government-approved” telepathic
training program for candidates selected for their political
trustworthiness or powerful backers.

The benefits of having an imperceptible mental spy are too great for
most states to forgo.

Most worlds do not ban telepaths. On these planets, the sheer rarity
of psychic powers and the limited chance that any one individual might
be unlawfully scanned outweigh any fear of unchecked telepathic
intrusion. Telepathic testimony is almost never accepted in a court of
law, however, outside of the most psychic-centered societies.

Almost all worlds forbid the uninvited use of telepathic powers on
another person. The crime is very difficult to prove, but usually
comes with harsh penalties. Open admission of an illicit scan is
generally considered proof, so PC telepaths are advised to be
discreet.

Telepathic shielding devices and substances do exist in very limited
amounts. Even during the height of the Mandate, such resources were
never abundant. Nowadays, only heads of state and similar elite
personages might expect to shelter behind psionics-proof walls or have
devices to alert them to telepathic tampering. Even then, many worlds
will simply lack the pretech artifacts to erect such protection, even
for their most important members.


<a id="telepathy-using-and-detecting-telepathy"></a>

## Using and Detecting Telepathy

Telepathy operates at a very basic level of mental contact, and is not
impeded by a lack of shared languages. While the basic forms of
telepathy only function on intelligent creatures, aliens or
transhumans with human-like cognition can be affected. VIs, True AIs,
and other non-biological intelligences are not normally subject to
Telepathy techniques.

Telepathy is a subtle ability, and targets of its technique will not
normally be aware of it. Only those with metapsionic expertise or
Telepathy-0 skill or greater can tell when they've been targeted by
Telepathy. Others may suspect this influence, particularly if they're
aware of the existence of psychics and have just done something
utterly inexplicable to their own reasoning. Certain extremely rare
TL5 devices can also alert a target to the presence of telepathic
tampering.


<a id="telepathy-telepathic-contact"></a>

## Core Technique - Telepathic Contact

The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a
sentient target's thoughts. The target must be visible or otherwise
perceptible to the telepath's unaided senses. Opening a contact
requires the telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action,
and the contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other
techniques.

The depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic's
Telepathy skill. A single contact can use any or all of the effects
permitted to a telepath of the user's skill level. Basic forms of
contact do not allow for a saving throw, though more advanced probes
allow the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On a
successful save, no form of this technique that allows a save can be
used on them for the rest of the scene.

-   ***Level-0:*** Observe emotional states in a target. Intense emotions
    provide a single word or image related to the focus of the feelings.

-   ***Level-1:*** A shallow gestalt with the target's language centers
    allows the telepath to understand any form of communication made by
    the target. If the psychic has the requisite body parts to speak the
    target's language, they can communicate with it in turn.

-   ***Level-2:*** The psychic's awareness of the target's surface
    cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts,
    though it can't pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The
    target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this.

-   ***Level-3:*** The psychic can drill down into the target's memory to
    get a one or two-sentence answer to any single question they ask, or
    receive a single answering vision of the target's recollections. The
    target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and
    whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It
    can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.

-   ***Level-4:*** The psychic instantly gets a full and nuanced awareness
    of everything the target can remember about a particular topic. The
    target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and
    whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended
    afterwards. It can be re-established, but only by activating this
    technique again.


<a id="telepathy-facile-mind"></a>

### Facile Mind     :level_1:

The telepath is practiced at opening a *Telepathic Contact*, and need
only Commit Effort for the scene to do so, instead of Committing
Effort for the day. If contacting an ally who has practiced the
process with the psychic for at least a week, opening the contact
normally requires no Effort at all. In both cases, if the telepath
chooses to Commit Effort for the day, they can open a *Telepathic
Contact* as an Instant action rather than a Main Action.


<a id="telepathy-transmit-thought"></a>

### Transmit Thought     :level_1:

The telepath can send thoughts and images over a *Telepathic Contact*,
allowing two-way communication with a willing target as an Instant
action when desired.


<a id="telepathy-far-thought"></a>

### Far Thought     :level_2:

Once a telepath has made a *Telepathic Contact* with a target, they
can thereafter activate the technique whenever that target is within
100 kilometers, whether or not the psychic knows where they are. At
Telepathy-3 the range increases to 1,000 kilometers, and at
Telepathy-4 it extends over an entire planet and up to orbital
distances. This distant connection is tenuous, however, and the
psychic cannot use any technique through it that would allow the
target a saving throw to resist.


<a id="telepathy-suppress-cognition"></a>

### Suppress Cognition     :level_2:

Through intense focus, the telepath can make the target of a
*Telepathic Contact* simply not think about something, whether that's
the presence of the telepath, the possibility of committing violence,
the absence of important documentation, or any other single potential
action or one specific person. This technique requires the psychic to
Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action. The target gets a Mental
saving throw to resist this power and become immune to it for the
scene. If failed, the thought remains unthinkable for the rest of the
scene unless the target perceives physical danger or a traumatic
threat to something they prize highly. In that case, the block
instantly dissolves and cannot be re-established during the
scene. Once the effect ends, the target will remain oblivious to their
temporary fugue unless it is brought to their attention somehow.


<a id="telepathy-reflex-response"></a>

### Reflex Response     :level_3:

As a Main Action, the telepath can Commit Effort for the day to force
a sudden, irrational impulse into the target of a *Telepathic
Contact*. The target may make a Mental saving throw to resist; on a
failure, they will use their next available action to carry out the
impulse to the best of their ability. This impulse cannot be
self-injurious or harmful to a loved one, but it can be foolish,
reckless, or harmful to others. The target may not understand why they
have done the action, but will usually attempt to rationalize it as
their choice.


<a id="telepathy-telepathic-assault"></a>

### Telepathic Assault     :level_3:

The telepath Commits Effort for the day as a Main Action to force a
wave of metadimensional energy through the brain of a *Telepathic
Contact* target. The assault does 6d6 damage, or 9d6 damage if the
telepath has Telepathy-4 skill. The target may make a Mental saving
throw to halve the damage. This assault cannot kill a target, but can
knock them unconscious for an hour if they're reduced to zero hit
points, after which they wake up with one hit point. A victim cannot
be targeted by an assault more than once per scene.


<a id="telepathy-memory-editing"></a>

### Memory Editing     :level_4:

The telepath can make simple edits to the memory of a target currently
linked by a *Telepathic Contact*. Events of no more than 24 hours in
duration can be erased from memory, conversations can be created or
changed, new events can be added to a day, or other similar
alterations made. The psychic can make these changes as a Main Action
by Committing Effort for the day. If the psychic doesn't have a good
understanding of the memories they're changing, such as might be
granted by the level-4 degree of *Telepathic Contact*, the edits they
make may not fit well. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist
editing for the rest of the scene, but on a failure, they will not
notice the changed memories until given a reason to recollect them.


<a id="sidebar-telepathic-control"></a>

## Telepathic Control

Telepathy is not a discipline well-suited to direct mental control of
other beings. While a telepath can impart urges and thoughts to a
target, they lack the tools to assume direct control of a victim's
physical actions. The best they can do is implant ideas in the
target's head and try to hijack the short-term cognition of the
victim.

Persistent legends speak of more direct disciplines practiced during
the Mandate's heyday. These arts supposedly allowed a psychic to take
direct control of a subject's physical form, manipulating it with
effortless ease to perform whatever acts the psychic desired. Unlike
telepathy, however, these disciplines were unable to touch the
cognitive centers of a target or read their mental activity. If any
such disciplines ever existed, their possessors are doubtless very
discreet with them.


<a id="telepathy-unity-of-thought"></a>

### Unity of Thought     :level_4:

The telepath becomes exceptionally skilled at weaving together
multiple allied minds. When they establish a *Telepathic Contact* with
a willing ally they may bind up to six willing participants into the
same contact without further Effort. This multi-person link is
relatively shallow, and allows only the Instant exchange of thoughts,
images, and sensory impressions. While under its effect, every
participant knows the exact location and condition of all others, and
uses the best Initiative roll of any of them if combat commences. At
the table, up to five minutes of discussion and coordination among the
players can be arranged each round without incurring delays for the
PCs. Every combat turn, one gestalt member of the psychic's choice
gets an extra round of action to represent the benefits of the perfect
coordination of the group. The psychic cannot gain this bonus round
himself. The telepathic link lasts as long as the psychic initiates no
new *Telepathic Contact*, and it has a range that extends to any point
within a solar system.


<a id="teleportation"></a>

# Teleportation

Teleporters do not provoke the kind of persistent worry that telepaths
induce in most normals, but their particular gifts cause a more
physical concern. An experienced teleporter can reach or see into any
location they've ever been; security officials don't just need to make
sure that no teleporter is in a restricted area, but that they've
never been there before at any time. Access into the most important
areas is carefully filtered to ensure that no outside teleporter ever
gets a chance to see a location they might suddenly appear in several
months or years later.

Most governments with access to trained psychics will have at least a
few expert teleporters on hand to provide untraceable communications
links and superlative infiltrators. Despite their many advantages in
intrusion and evasion, however, a teleporter needs the skills to
actually get *into* a restricted area before they can take advantage
of a quick escape. It's not unknown for teleporters to be paired with
more conventional burglars who supply the security-defeating skills
and information-gathering talents that a professional psychic doesn't
always have the time to cultivate.

The criminal applications of teleportation are obvious, as is its
utility in surveillance. Some bold teleporters make excellent money as
thieves or spies for whatever employer can afford their exorbitant
fees. The price for their services is invariably high, not only due to
the rarity of experienced teleporters, but due to the consequences of
arrest.

As tempting as the criminal path can be for many teleporters, most are
dissuaded by the penalties. Very few worlds have prison facilities
that are in any way designed to cope with teleporting inmates. On
advanced worlds, this means that criminal teleporters are often
implanted with surgical bombs keyed to explode if they leave a
restricted area or stop receiving a specific signal from a government
transmitter. On primitive worlds, this means that criminal teleporters
face summary execution for any crime more serious than a misdemeanor.

Some devices can be used to defeat teleporters, creating a curdled
patch of metadimensional space that is impossible to enter or leave
via teleportation. These ancient pretech artifacts are invariably
ridiculously expensive in the unlikely case that a planetary
government allows them to remain in private hands at all, and only the
most important figures of an advanced world will have any access to
teleporter-sealed “safe zones”. Many worlds have no access to such
devices at all, with even princes and potentates left to keep a wary
eye on teleporting psychics. A metapsion brainguard is the usual
lowtech answer to psychic threats, if such an expensive mercenary can
be hired on the world.


<a id="teleportation-personal-apportation"></a>

## Core Technique - Personal Apportation

The teleporter can translocate to another location they have either
occupied before or can see with their unaided vision. Locations are
fixed in reference to the nearest major gravity well. For example, it
is not possible to teleport to the cockpit of a distant moving vehicle
they once occupied, but they can teleport to another point on a
planet's surface even though the planet has since moved far through
the stellar void.

The core technique allows the teleporter to move himself and any mass
he is able to carry with his own natural strength. Resisting targets
cannot be carried along, and unresisting ones must be touched. A
teleporter can leave any clothing, shackles, adhesions, or other
matter behind when he teleports, but he cannot leave behind matter
that has been inserted into his body, such as cybernetics or
shrapnel. Matter cannot be partially left behind.

A teleporter will instinctively abort any apportation that would leave
him embedded in a solid object or in an environment of imminent
physical harm. Any Committed Effort on such aborted jumps is wasted,
as is any action spent triggering the power.

The maximum range of *Personal Apportation* depends on the
teleporter's skill level. Teleporting with *Personal Apportation*
counts as a Main Action and requires that the psychic Commit Effort
for the scene.

-   ***Level-0:*** The psychic can teleport up to 10 meters.

-   ***Level-1:*** The psychic can teleport up to 100 meters. ***Level-2:***
    The psychic can teleport up to 10 kilometers.

-   ***Level-3:*** The psychic can teleport up to 1,000 kilometers.

-   ***Level-4:*** The psychic can teleport anywhere on a planet's surface
    or near orbit.


<a id="teleportation-proficient-apportation"></a>

### Proficient Apportation     :level_1:

*Personal Apportation* now counts as a Move action, though it still
can be performed only once per round. Apportations of 10 meters or
less no longer require Effort to be Committed, though any augments to
the technique must still be paid for normally.


<a id="teleportation-spatial-awareness"></a>

### Spatial Awareness     :level_1:

The psychic may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to gain an
intuitive 360-degree awareness of their physical surroundings. The
sense is roughly equivalent to sight out to 100 meters, though it
cannot read text or distinguish colors. It is blocked by solid objects
but is unimpeded by darkness, mist, blinding light, holograms, or
optical illusions. The sense lasts as long as the Effort remains
Committed to the technique.


<a id="teleportation-burdened-apportation"></a>

### Burdened Apportation     :level_2:

The psychic can carry willing companions with them when using
*Personal Apportation*. Up to three human-sized companions and their
man-portable gear may be carried per skill level in
Teleportation. Allies must be within 3 meters of the teleporter to be
carried along. Ordinary inert matter cannot be carried along unless
the psychic is touching it or it's being carried by an ally affected
by this power. If carrying inert mass, up to two hundred kilos of
objects can be carried per skill level. Using this technique increases
the Effort cost of *Personal Apportation*, requiring that an extra
point of Effort be Committed for the day.


<a id="teleportation-perceptive-dislocation"></a>

### Perceptive Dislocation     :level_2:

Commit Effort for the day to sense any location the psychic could
teleport to. The psychic perceives the location as if there, lasting
for fifteen minutes at most.


<a id="teleportation-spatial-synchrony-mandala"></a>

### Spatial Synchrony Mandala     :level_2:

The psychic imprints a particular object or person on their psionic
awareness. Provided the object is relatively intact and in range of
their *Personal Apportation*, the psychic always knows its exact
location and can teleport to within three meters of it with *Personal
Apportation* even if it has moved from its original
location. Imprinting an object requires an hour's meditation with it,
and only one object can be imprinted at a time. If imprinting on a
person, the target must be willing and cooperative to make the
imprint. Objects must be at least one kilogram in mass to be
effectively tracked.


<a id="teleportation-effortless-apportation"></a>

### Effortless Apportation     :level_3:

The psychic does not need to Commit Effort to use *Personal
Apportation*. If the technique is augmented by other techniques that
come with their own extra or increased cost, however, this extra cost
must still be paid.


<a id="teleportation-stutterjump"></a>

### Stutterjump     :level_3:

The psychic can instinctively micro-teleport away from incoming
danger. As an On Turn action they may Commit Effort to begin shifting
their spatial position away from attacks, gaining a base Armor Class
of 20 so long as the Effort remains Committed. This Armor Class is not
modified by armor, shields, or Dexterity modifiers, and the
micro-jumps do not significantly move the psychic from their current
location. While *Stutterjump* is active, as an Instant action the
adept may Commit Effort for the day to negate a successful hit by a
weapon attack, even after damage has been rolled. This reflexive
defensive jump may be used only once per day and leaves the psychic
just outside the radius of explosions or other area-effect attacks.


<a id="teleportation-rift-reduplication"></a>

### Rift Reduplication     :level_3:

Expert teleporters can be infuriatingly difficult to pin down. By
Committing an additional Effort for the day as an Instant action, the
adept can use *Personal Apportation* as an On Turn action, even if
they've already used it once this round. Apporting itself costs
whatever Effort it normally would, in addition to any techniques that
augment it. *Rift Reduplication* can only be triggered once per round.

If the adept uses their powers to teleport into a location, perform an
action, and then use *Rift Reduplication* to teleport back out,
onlookers in the area will not have time to react to their action or
attack the adept unless the onlookers have held their action
explicitly to counter the psychic. Enemies who hold their action this
way waste it entirely if the psychic does not give them a chance to
attack or otherwise interfere. Such a lightning strike may be
surprising to onlookers, but it doesn't allow enough preparation time
to count as an Execution Attack as described here.


<a id="teleportation-deep-intrusion"></a>

### Deep Intrusion     :level_4:

The adept can use *Personal Apportation* to blind-teleport into a
building, structure, vehicle, or spaceship visible to them, including
spaceships close enough to engage in conventional ship-to-ship
combat. They intuitively seek out a space large enough to hold them
and without immediate environmental hazards, but cannot control their
precise destination. Using this technique in conjunction with
*Personal Apportation* is very draining to the psychic, and requires
that they Commit an additional Effort point for the day.


<a id="teleportation-offensive-apportation"></a>

### Offensive Apportation     :level_4:

The psychic can use *Personal Apportation* as a Main Action to
teleport an unwilling target, provided the user can make physical
contact with them. Contact with an unsuspecting or incapacitated
target is automatic, while touching a resisting enemy requires a Punch
hit roll with a bonus equal to the psychic's Teleportation skill. If
the psychic does not use the *Burdened Apportation* technique then
only the target is teleported; otherwise the user may go along with
them. The psychic cannot teleport a target to any location they could
not teleport to, including locations of imminent environmental danger,
such as high in the air, into a windowless tomb, or into the middle of
a sea. A conscious, resisting target can make a Mental saving throw to
forcibly abort the teleportation, rolling at a penalty equal to the
psychic's Teleportation skill. Use of this technique adds to the cost
of *Personal Apportation*, requiring the psychic Commit an additional
point of Effort for the day whether the touch hits or not.

# Systems

Even the most capable interstellar adventurer sometimes encounters a
situation where the outcome is by no means certain. When an alien
assassin thrusts a blade at an unguarded back, or the ship threatens
to careen out of control in a gas giant's upper atmosphere, or when
the hero has been critically injured and lies bleeding on a cavern
floor, how do you tell what's going to happen next? This chapter
provides you with certain basic systems you can use to resolve these
questions.


<a id="the-basic-mechanics"></a>

## The Basic Mechanics

The three primary systems that most heroes are going to interact with
most often are skill checks, saving throws, and combat rounds. Every
player and GM ought to read those sections and understand the basic
mechanisms involved, because they're going to be seeing a lot of them
in their star-faring adventures.

-   ***Skill checks*** tell you whether or not your hero succeeds at a
    particular feat of expertise or natural competence. Whenever it's
    uncertain whether or not your hero can manage a feat, your GM might
    call for a skill check. Failure at the roll means that your hero
    either botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly
    unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected outside influence.

-   ***Saving throws*** tell you whether or not your hero evades some
    immediate peril. If you need to know whether or not the alien
    insect's poison overwhelms you, or if you can dive away from the
    grenade before it explodes, or if the villainous psychic's
    mind-reading powers can pry out your secrets, you make a saving
    throw. The GM will tell you when you should be making one.

-   ***Combat rounds*** tell you whether or not your hero has shot,
    stabbed, exploded, maimed, punched, or otherwise ventilated their
    foe, and whether the foe has managed to do the same to them. Combat
    in ***Stars Without Number*** is very dangerous, especially to novice
    adventurers and ordinary NPCs. One thug with a pistol and a steady
    hand can kill most newly-minted heroes with a single well-aimed
    bullet, and most normal men and women have even less of a chance
    against lethal violence. Warrior heroes and others with a specific
    talent for combat are more durable against these martial perils, but
    even they have to respect the threat of a mob of angry spearmen or a
    sniper rifle's crosshairs.

The combat section is a particularly important read if your own gaming
history has lent itself more towards games that have very sturdy
protagonists or narratively-shielded player characters. A first-level
Warrior in ***Stars Without Number*** is lethally dangerous to an
ordinary street thug or faceless enemy minion, but three or four mooks
with street-built slugthrowers are likely to put that budding hero
down hard. More experienced PCs gain a larger margin of safety as they
gain more hit points, but there's no PC that can laugh off a dozen
combat infantrymen with mag rifles and a will to use them. Don't
assume your character is going to survive an experience just because
they're a PC.


<a id="using-the-systems"></a>

## Using the Systems

***Stars Without Number*** is built to support a sandbox gaming
experience, and the systems in this chapter are part of that. By
default, they're meant to be fair, understandable, and flexible enough
to be applied to many situations. They're not meant to especially
favor the PCs, however, or to give them ways to bypass the results of
some poor decision or unlucky moment. There is no “narrative currency”
the player can spend to avert disaster. This is not the only way a
group can play the game, but it is intentionally the default mode.

It's not that these systems are perfect, but that they are an unbiased
third party to your gaming session. When the GM calls for a skill
check, or rolls a hit roll for an alien warlord's chainaxe, he
honestly doesn't know what's going to happen. His judgment might apply
bonuses or penalties to the dice, or he might choose to tweak the
system to fit the immediate situation, but ultimately the dice are
resolving the situation. This is important for a sandbox game, because
the dice are as fair as they are merciless.

This fairness adds surprise and interest to a night's gaming. Even the
GM isn't completely certain what's going to happen when the PCs forge
ahead, and this surprise and novelty help keep the GM interested in
events, and not just a programmatic maestro for preset situations and
outcomes. Every gaming session is a chance for something unexpected to
boil out of a chance throw of the dice, whether that happens when the
PCs catastrophically botch their attempt to defuse a nuclear fission
bomb or when that alien warlord just happens to catch a ten-kilo
demolitions charge with his chestplate. Even when cruel dice fell a
heroic PC, that very degree of danger helps make the rest of the
party's survival more meaningful. They lived because they made good
choices and had a bare minimum of luck, not because they were the
designated heroes.

Not all groups will want to play the game this way, however, and that
too is perfectly acceptable. Some groups *do* want to let Fate weigh
in on their side, and let death and disaster have to get through a
little more narrative armor first. A GM running a game like this can
often produce this effect without the need for explicitly changing die
rolls or introducing destiny chips, simply by deciding on gentler
outcomes for failures, minimizing murder-obsessed enemies, and
explicitly arranging escape routes for overmatched PCs. This game
belongs to you and your group, and you should run it the way *you*
want it to be run.


<a id="scenes-and-durations"></a>

## Scenes and Durations

Many psychic abilities and other powers have durations expressed in
***scenes***. A scene is just a shorthand concept for a particular
action sequence or exertion on the part of the PCs. A single combat
encounter is a scene, as is the infiltration of a building, the ascent
of a radioactive mountainside, or a tense meeting with an alien
overlord's cybernetic representative. Most scenes don't last for
longer than fifteen minutes or a single contiguous chunk of action,
but the maximum duration is up to the GM's discretion. It's quite
possible to have an evening's play where most of the time isn't
tracked, only marking scenes for important negotiations, gunfire, or
time-critical feats of skill.

Some powers are limited to being used only so many times in a given
scene, or require Effort expenditures that only come back at the end
of the scene. Outside of situations where close time-tracking is
important, you can assume that these powers can be used or that the
Effort comes back about once every fifteen minutes, assuming the PC
has intervals for rest.


<a id="saving-throws"></a>

## Saving Throws

There are times when misfortune or unpredictable peril befalls a
hero. Only luck or their own natural hardiness can save them from
disaster, and to do so they must make a saving throw.

Saving throws come in three kinds. ***Physical*** saves relate to
challenges of physical endurance such as poisons, diseases, radiation,
or dire exhaustion. ***Evasion*** saves involve dodging explosions,
evading falling hazards, diving back from a crumbling surface, or
otherwise exerting one's powers of speed and swift
reaction. ***Mental*** saves relate most often to psychic influences,
hallucinations, esoteric mental control technologies, and other perils
that assault a hero's mind or perceptions. Mental saves can also be
used when no other saving throw category seems to apply and only blind
luck and ineffable intuition can save the hero.

Your character's saving throw scores start at 15, and decrease by one
point each time you advance a level. Each saving throw is modified by
the best modifier of two different attributes: Physical by the better
of Strength or Constitution, Evasion by the better of Dexterity or
Intelligence, and Mental by the better of Charisma or Wisdom. Thus, a
first-level PC with a Strength of 5 and a Constitution of 14 would
have a Physical save of 14.

To make a save, roll 1d20 and try to equal or beat the appropriate
saving throw score. On a success, you evade or mitigate the peril,
while on a failure it takes full effect. A natural roll of 1 is always
a failure, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

The GM decides when a saving throw is appropriate. Some dangers might
not allow one at all.


<a id="sidebar-poison-and-peril"></a>

## Poison and Peril

While cutting their way through the blue jungles of Qinglin, a
luxuriant blossom of cerulean crystal catches Eden's eye. The young
adventuress is eager to find something to make their reeking weeks in
this azure Hell worthwhile for her and her brother Randall, but she's
no fool, and promptly extends her 3.048-meter probe pole to gently
joggle the bloom from a safe distance away.

The two adventurers are so focused on their examination of the flower
that they risk missing the stealthy creep of a many-legged creature
that approaches through the undergrowth. The GM calls for Wis/Notice
skill checks from both of the PCs. Eden's Wisdom modifier of +0 and
lack of the Notice skill leave her with a -1 penalty. She rolls 2d6
and gets a 6. Her brother Randall has a Wisdom modifier of +1 and
Notice-0 skill, which gives him a net +1 bonus on his roll, and a
result of 11.

The GM decides that sneaking through the undergrowth is a sort of
thing that venomous alien hunters would be good at, so he applies the
creature's +1 skill bonus to its own stealth roll. Unfortunately for
the young heroes, it rolls a 12, approaching the pair undetected.

The GM rolls randomly to see which of the pair is closest and finds
that Randall is the unlucky winner. The dog-sized monstrosity leaps on
the psychic and stabs him with its venomous proboscis.

The GM knows that the poison of this dread beast is enough to kill an
unlucky victim in a matter of minutes. But did Randall receive a
lethal dose? He asks Randall's player to make a Physical saving throw.

The psychic's Physical saving throw target is 14, so his player
reaches for a d20 and rolls, coming up with a natural 20 on the
dice. A natural 20 is always a success, even if penalties would
otherwise make the roll a failure.

Randall staggers under the attack, but most of the beast's poison
stains his armor harmlessly. He's shaky, but can push through the dose
he got with no ill effects. That's a good thing, because that
scuttler's egg-mate is hurrying up through the brush&#x2026;


<a id="skill-checks-1"></a>

# Skill Checks

Most characters are skilled, competent men and women who are perfectly
capable of carrying out the ordinary duties of their role. Sometimes,
however, they are faced with a situation or challenge beyond the usual
scope of their role and must make a ***skill check***.

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level
and attribute modifier. If the total is equal or higher than the
check's difficulty, the check is a success. On a failure, the PC
either can't accomplish the feat at all or they achieve it at the cost
of some further complication to the situation. The GM determines the
specific outcome of a failure.

If the character doesn't even have level-0 in the pertinent skill,
they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll. In the case of particularly
technical or esoteric skills they might not even be able to attempt
the skill check at all.

Some checks might be suitable for more than one skill. A
javelin-throwing contest might use Exert for being an athletic
contest, or Shoot for involving a ranged weapon, or Stab for using a
muscle-powered thrown weapon. In such cases the PC can use the best
applicable skill. In other situations, a skill might seem peripherally
relevant; trying to find the hidden bomb in a starship's engine core
before it detonates might certainly use Notice or Fix, but a GM might
also let Pilot be applied, as a veteran pilot might be expected to
know what their engine should look like. In such peripheral cases, the
check difficulty usually increases by 2.

</table>

Particularly helpful or hostile circumstances might give a bonus or
penalty to the skill check. As a general rule, extremely bad
circumstances or tools would apply up to a -2 penalty to the skill
check, while a very good situation or the perfect set of tools might
give up to a +2 bonus to the roll. Usually, no combination of
modifiers should add more than +2 or -2 to any given skill check.


<a id="when-to-call-for-a-check"></a>

## When To Call for a Check

Skill checks should only be called for challenges that fall outside
the PC's background and common experience. A PC with the background of
a starship pilot should not be rolling skill checks to land a ship or
navigate to an in-system destination. As a general rule of thumb, if
failure at a particular task would make the PC seem notably
incompetent at their role in life, then they shouldn't have to roll a
skill check for it. In addition, if failure or success at a check
really doesn't *matter* in the game, if it won't produce some
interesting result either way, then a check shouldn't be made.

Even concept-related feats might require a skill check, however, if
the situation is especially bad or the circumstances particularly
hostile. The pilot might have to make a Pilot skill check to land a
ship if they attempt it in the middle of a man-killing sandstorm, and
a noble might have to make a Connect skill check to find shelter with
an aristocratic relation if they're currently wanted by the stellar
tyrant's guards.


<a id="aiding-a-skill-check"></a>

## Aiding a Skill Check

Sometimes one PC will want to lend a hand to another as they attempt a
difficult feat. To do this, the player first describes what sort of
action they are taking to help their comrade. If the GM agrees that
their effort makes sense and would be helpful, the player then rolls a
relevant skill check against the same difficulty as the original
check. If it's a success, the other PC gets a +1 bonus on their
roll. Multiple PCs can try to help, but the acting PC can't earn more
than a +1 total bonus.

The helping skill doesn't necessarily have to be the same skill the PC
is checking. If a player can think of a way to help a Sneak check with
Talk, then so be it.


<a id="opposed-skill-checks"></a>

## Opposed Skill Checks

Sometimes a PC wants to accomplish something that another character
wants to prevent. Sneaking past an alert guard, winning a shooting
tournament, or besting an alien in a tentacle-wrestling competition
might all be opposed skill checks.

In such cases, all participants roll their relevant skills and the
highest score wins, with ties going to the PC. To make the NPC's roll,
check their listed skill bonus; they can add it to any skill check
appropriate to their role or profession. If the NPC has no reason to
be particularly good at the challenge, they simply roll 2d6 and add
nothing.

In most cases, the relevant skills are obvious. A character trying to
skulk past a vigilant guard would be rolling their Dex/Sneak against
the guard's roll, while one trying to out-tentacle an alien would be
rolling Str/Exert. When in doubt, the GM decides which skill is most
applicable.


<a id="combat"></a>

# Combat

Sometimes the only reasonable response to a situation involves drawn
monoblades and heavy plasma fire. In such unfortunate hours your
heroes will have to engage in combat.

Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** is a lethal sort of experience,
especially for novice interstellar adventurers. Even hardened Warriors
can go down in a hurry under a withering hail of mag rifle fire or the
scrap-steel knives of a hiveworld gang pack. PCs should be very
certain that the odds are in their favor before they reach for their
laser pistols, and even then, the gods of battle can be cruel.


<a id="rounds-and-initiative"></a>

## Rounds and Initiative

Combat and other time-sensitive situations are divided up into
***rounds***. Each round is approximately six seconds, during which all
participants may act. When everyone has acted, the round ends and a
new one begins.

To determine who acts first in a round, each participant rolls
***initiative***. Each rolls 1d8 and adds their Dexterity modifier. NPCs
usually have no modifier. The participants then act in order, high
roll to low, with PCs winning ties. When everyone has had a turn to
act, the sequence starts over again from the top. Initiative is not
re-rolled.

Optionally, the GM may choose to use group initiative instead in their
campaigns. The PC with the best Dexterity bonus rolls for the party,
and the GM rolls one die for the other NPCs. Members of the side that
rolled highest may act first in whatever order they wish, and then the
next-highest side acts. While easier to manage, it also increases the
value of winning initiative, and can leave the heroes in dire peril if
a large group of foes wins the roll.

Sometimes a person is surprised or ambushed. Most ambushes involve a
contested Dex/Sneak roll against a target's Wis/Notice check, with the
defender winning ties. In other cases the surprise may be practically
inevitable, such as a disguised assassin suddenly lashing out with a
monoblade in the middle of a society ball. Ambush targets who fail the
contested roll are ***surprised***. A surprised target doesn't get to
roll initiative until the second round of combat and can perform only
Instant actions while surprised. NPCs with roles relevant to being
vigilant or stealthy would gain their skill bonus to these checks,
while others would simply roll an unmodified 2d6 for the opposed
check.

Most PCs are not subject to surprise unless their guard is genuinely
down at the moment of the ambush or attack. Someone walking in a
dangerous part of a city or picking their way through a
seemingly-abandoned space station is unlikely to be astonished by the
sudden appearance of danger, unless the attack is so sudden and from
such an unexpected quarter that even their obvious caution is
insufficient.


<a id="types-of-actions-in-combat"></a>

## Types of Actions

When an actor's turn comes up in the round, they may perform
actions. Actions are divided into four different types: ***Main
Actions***, ***Moves***, ***On Turn*** actions, or ***Instant.***


<a id="main-action-one-per-turn"></a>

### Main Action - One per Turn

Every actor can make one Main Action each round. Main Actions are
those deeds that are going to absorb most of the six-second round,
such as attacking an enemy, bracing a door, applying first aid to a
downed ally, digging a Stowed item out of a pack, manipulating a
complex device, or some other activity that takes up their focus. In
place of their Main Action, an actor can take a second Move action.


<a id="move-action-one-per-turn"></a>

### Move Action - One per Turn

Every actor can make one Move action each round, running up to 10
meters. This movement assumes that an actor is dodging enemies, paying
attention to the surroundings, navigating awkward terrain, and
generally dealing with the hazards of a battlefield. Climbing a
surface, swimming, or passing extremely rough terrain halves this
movement rate. Actors can't split their Move action, such as taking
part of it before using their Main Action and the rest afterwards.

An actor who wants to disengage from an opponent in melee must use
their Main Action to perform a [*Fighting Withdrawal*](#fighting-withdrawal-main-action), or else they
suffer a free automatic melee attack from any foe engaged with
them. There is no need to spend a Main Action disengaging from enemies
who are wielding only ranged weapons. While it's possible to use a
rifle to buttstroke someone or pistol-whip a near combatant, such
weapons aren't as effectively threatening as true melee weapons.


<a id="on-turn-action-your-turn"></a>

### On Turn Action - Any Amount on Your Turn

An On Turn action is some fast, simple act that could reasonably be
performed while an actor is doing something else. Dropping an object,
falling prone, saying something, drawing a Readied item, or activating
a simple device might all be On Turn actions. A PC can perform as many
On Turn actions as they want in a round, subject to the GM's
discretion.


<a id="instant-action-any-time"></a>

### Instant Action - Any Amount, Any Time

An Instant action is special, in that it can be performed even when
it's not the actor's turn, or even after attacks or damage have
already been rolled. Some psychic powers are Instant actions, allowing
the actor to use them after they decide they don't like how the dice
have fallen. Certain combat actions are also Instant, though they
often cost the actor's Main Action for the round as well. Any number
of Instant actions can be performed during a round.


<a id="hitting-an-enemy"></a>

### Hitting an Enemy

When an actor wants to hurt a target, they need to use their Main
Action to make an attack roll. An attack roll represents not just one
shot or swing, but the assailant spending their round trying to get in
a good hit or a clean shot at the target.

To make an attack roll, the assailant rolls 1d20 and adds their attack
bonus, their applicable skill level, and the attribute modifier most
relevant to the weapon. If the total is equal or higher than the
target's Armor Class, the attack is successful.

A PC's attack bonus is usually equal to half their character level,
rounded down. Characters with the Warrior class or an Adventurer with
the Partial Warrior class option have higher base attack bonuses. NPCs
have their own attack bonus listed with their statistics, which
includes any modifiers they might have.

A PC's skill level is their Punch, Stab, or Shoot skill in most cases,
depending on what kind of weapon they're using. In rare cases, a
different skill might be involved, such as Pilot for the guns of a
light starfighter. If a PC doesn't even have level-0 expertise in the
type of weapon they're using, they suffer a -2 penalty on hit rolls
for unfamiliarity with it.

A PC’s attribute modifier depends on the weapon. For ranged weapons,
this is usually Dexterity, while smaller melee weapons might use
Strength or Dexterity, and large ones might rely on Strength alone. If
a weapon has more than one attribute listed, use the best.

A successful attack inflicts hit point damage equal to the weapon’s
damage die plus the relevant attribute modifier. Thus, a hero with a
+1 Dexterity modifier firing a laser pistol that does 1d6 damage would
inflict 1d6+1 hit points of damage on a hit. Skill levels do not add
to damage unless it is a Punch attack.

Some melee weapons apply ***Shock***, and are guaranteed to do some
degree of harm to a target. A weapon's Shock quality lists the number
of points of damage it inflicts on any target with an Armor Class
equal or less than the one given. Thus, a primitive knife with a Shock
score of “1 point/AC 15” would always do at least 1 point of damage
whenever its wielder attacks a target with AC 15 or less, whether they
hit or miss.

Shock damage always adds the wielder's attribute modifier and any
other bonuses that might apply from weapon mods, foci, or other
advanced tech. Some advanced armor will always protect completely
against primitive weapons, however, and some advanced weapons can
ignore primitive gear, treating it as AC 10.

A successful attack doesn't always mean a direct physical hit. A
flurry of strokes that force an enemy off-balance, graze him, frighten
him, or exhaust him might all drain his hit points, bringing him
closer to defeat without actually inflicting real physical harm. Only
the last handful of hit points reflect serious bodily damage. It's up
to the GM and player to decide how to describe the effects of a
successful hit.


<a id="hit-roll-modifiers"></a>

### Hit Roll Modifiers

Sometimes it can be easier or harder to connect with a blow depending
on the combat situation. The table below offers some suggested hit
roll modifiers for common combat circumstances.

Finding cover is often critical in a gun battle. Generally, firing
around a convenient corner or shooting over sandbags would qualify as
half cover, while firing through slits or from carefully-prepared
bunkers would allow for full cover. Melee attackers can usually ignore
cover, as they get too close for their target to take proper advantage
of it. Being prone doesn't stack with hard cover, but sometimes the
available cover is so low that the hero has to be flat to benefit from
it.

A gunman who can set up a prepared firing position can get a
significant advantage. Such a position usually requires at least five
minutes of sighting and setting up a rest. Most such positions provide
some cover.

# Common Actions in Combat

While a PC can do anything they might reasonably accomplish in six
seconds as their Main Action for a round, some choices are more common
than others. Below are a list of some of the tactics or actions that
come up most often in combat.


<a id="make-a-melee-attack-main-action"></a>

## Make a Melee Attack - Main Action

The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range, rolling a normal
hit roll and inflicting damage on a successful hit. Most melee attacks
inflict Shock damage on a miss, if the target's Armor Class is low
enough, and no successful hit does less damage than the weapon's Shock
would have done on a miss. An attacker's weapon must be Readied in
order to attack with it.


<a id="make-a-ranged-attack-main-action"></a>

## Make a Ranged Attack - Main Action

The combatant fires or throws a Readied ranged weapon at a target. The
combatant can't *Make a Ranged Attack* with a two-handed weapon if
there's a enemy armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it's too
easy for the assailant to bind up a rifle-sized gun. One-handed ranged
weapons and thrown weapons can still be used, albeit at a -4 penalty
to hit.


<a id="make-a-snap-attack-instant-action"></a>

## Make a Snap Attack - Instant Action

A combatant with a Ready weapon can rush their attack, sacrificing
accuracy for speed. The combatant must still have their Main Action
impending or available. As an Instant, they can sacrifice it to [*Make
a Melee Attack*](#make-a-melee-attack-main-action) or [*Make a Ranged Attack*](#make-a-ranged-attack-main-action) against a foe in range,
whether a snap shot with a pistol or a quick thrust at an adjacent
melee foe. This attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll. If multiple
combatants decide to make Snap Attacks at the same time, they are
resolved simultaneously.

Snap Attacks are usually made only by the desperate, the
undisciplined, or the elite, and the GM should rarely have NPCs employ
them. Untrained hooligans might blaze away in excitement or panic, or
a gunman being charged by a howling spearman might risk a shot before
he gets too close, but most combatants can't afford to take such a
heavy penalty to their hit roll. Truly skilled combatants, however,
can sometimes get away with such risks, particularly if they have a
Warrior's class ability to turn a miss into a hit.


<a id="total-defense-instant-action"></a>

## Total Defense - Instant Action

As an Instant action, the combatant focuses on nothing other than
avoiding knives, gunfire, hurled crystalline spears, or other perils
in the vicinity. Using *Total Defense* costs the user their Main
Action for the round, and cannot be used if they've already employed
their Main Action. They become immune to Shock damage for the round
from melee weapons, regardless of their Armor Class, and gain a +2
bonus to their Armor Class until their next turn.


<a id="club-up-a-weapon-move-action"></a>

## Club Up a Weapon - Move Action

A combatant can shift their grip on a Readied rifle or pistol, using
it as a crude melee weapon rather than a ranged weapon. Rifle-sized
guns used this way count as a medium primitive weapon with no Shock
score, and pistol-sized guns count as a small primitive weapon with no
Shock score. Rolling maximum damage on a hit with such improvised
weapons will break them. This action can also be taken to unclub a
weapon and ready it to shoot.


<a id="run-move-action"></a>

## Run - Move Action

The combatant moves their normal combat movement rate, which is 10
meters for most humans. If they're climbing a surface, swimming, or
navigating extremely rough terrain, this movement rate is halved, and
they might have to make an Exert skill check to achieve even
that. Prone characters crab along at half this rate.


<a id="fighting-withdrawal-main-action"></a>

## Fighting Withdrawal - Main Action

The combatant disengages from any melee foes around them. They don't
actually move away, but they can now get away from their assailants
without giving them a free melee attack. Usually, this means the
combatant uses their Move action to get clear, because if they just
stand there the enemies might choose to re-engage them the next round.


<a id="use-a-skill-main-action"></a>

## Use a Skill - Main Action

The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few
seconds. An Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check to stabilize a wounded
comrade is one such potential use, as is executing a pre-programmed
hack, shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC allies, or
anything else that might be done quickly.


<a id="ready-or-stow-an-item-main-action"></a>

## Ready or Stow an Item - Main Action

The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from their backpack,
digs a magazine out of a belt pouch, or otherwise moves an object
around on their person. They can Ready an item this way or Stow it.


<a id="reload-a-weapon-main-action"></a>

## Reload a Weapon - Main Action

The combatant swaps a Readied power cell or magazine into their
weapon. Some very primitive firearms might require more than one
action to load them, while an archer can nock another arrow as a Move
action.


<a id="drop-an-item-instant-action"></a>

## Drop an Item - Instant Action

The combatant drops something they're holding. They can do this
Instantly at any time to free up their hands.


<a id="pick-up-an-item-move-action"></a>

## Pick up an Item - Move Action

The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they have a free
hand, leaving it Readied in their grip.


<a id="stand-up-move-action"></a>

## Stand Up - Move Action

The combatant gets up from a prone position. Most characters that have
just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much
else.


<a id="go-prone-on-turn-action"></a>

## Go Prone - On Turn Action

The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a
-2 penalty to hit them. Adjacent enemies find you an easier target,
however, gaining +2 to hit.


<a id="hold-an-action-move-action"></a>

## Hold An Action - Move Action

By choosing to *Hold An Action*, the combatant can delay taking the
rest of their actions until later in the round, activating them as an
Instant action. Thus, a hero who wins initiative might use their Move
action to *Hold An Action*. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes
around a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action to
[*Make A Ranged Attack*](#make-a-ranged-attack-main-action) with his readied laser rifle. If acting in
response to someone else's impending action, the held action is
resolved first.


<a id="sidebar-examples-of-murder"></a>

## Examples of Murder

Yaddle and Bort, two drunken hive thugs, get involved in an impromptu
knife fight over a card game. Yaddle wins the initiative roll, but
Bort elects to make a [Snap Attack](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action), since Yaddle is within convenient
range of Bort's Readied knife. Incensed, Yaddle also decides to make a
[Snap Attack](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action), so the two resolve their attacks simultaneously.

Bort has a hit bonus of +1. Being an NPC, he doesn't add skills or
attribute modifiers; he just rolls 1d20, adds 1 to it for his attack
bonus, and applies a -4 penalty for a [Snap Attack](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action) to find the Armor
Class he hits. His modified roll is 11, which is enough to hit the
unarmored

Yaddle, who has an AC of 10. Bort rolls 1d4 for his small, primitive
knife, inflicting 3 points of damage. Again, as an NPC, he doesn't add
attribute modifiers to the damage.

Yaddle has a similar hit bonus, but his modified roll is 7, less than
Bort's unarmored AC of 10, so he misses. His primitive knife does do 1
point of Shock damage to Bort, however, because a small primitive
weapon does its Shock damage to any target with an AC of 15 or less.

With the attacks resolved simultaneously, both now take damage. Yaddle
takes 3 points, and as he only had 3 hit points to begin with, he's
down and dying, spurting from several vicious slashes. Bort takes 1
damage from Shock, and since he was always a frail gutter rat with
only 1 hit point, he too is down, slipping into shock from a gash in
his belly. Luckily, he owes an onlooker money, so his creditor rushes
forward and tries to hold Bort's guts in with his coat.

Stabilizing a mortally wounded target requires an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal
skill check. The creditor is an NPC, and the GM decides that they have
no particular talent at first aid, so the GM rolls a flat 2d6 for them
and gets a lucky 10. That's just enough to stabilize Bort even without
the help of proper medical supplies, and so the downed victor is
carried off to a an unlicensed street doc for emergency patching.

After a month of recovery, a cocky Bort has equipped himself with a
spiked walking stick, a medium primitive weapon that is “more bashy”
than his small knife. He spots the young PC Warrior gunslinger Eliza
Darrick in the grimy hive street and covets her fine revolver. What
better way to acquire it than to cosh the young woman?

He sidles into position near her before raising his stick. Eliza has a
considerable fund of common sense and is not subject to surprise at
this turn of events, given the environment. Both roll initiative and
Bort wins. He makes his roll of 1d20+1, no longer rushed by a [Snap
Attack](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action), and gets a 13.

Eliza has an armored undersuit that grants her an AC of 13, plus a
bonus of +1 for her Dexterity modifier, for a total AC of 14. As
Bort's roll is lower, he misses. Because medium primitive weapons only
do Shock to targets with AC of 13 or less, Bort's stick doesn't even
do Shock damage to her.

Eliza then draws the Readied revolver that Bort so coveted and makes
her own attack roll of 1d20, +1 for her attack bonus, +1 more for her
Dexterity, and +1 more for her Shoot-1 skill. She rolls a total of 4,
an abysmal showing.

As she does not much care for being jumped by the likes of Bort, she
chooses to use her Warrior class ability to turn a missed shot into a
hit once per scene, sealing Bort's doom.

With only 1 hit point, it doesn't even matter what Eliza might roll
for damage. The GM describes the look of dull surprise on Bort's face
as Eliza's bullet plows a wet hole through his chest.

Eliza ducks down a side street as Bort falls to the filthy
asphalt. Even if the GM decided that Bort had a chance to survive his
wound, none of the denizens around him have any interest in anything
but the contents of his pockets. Bort gurgles out the last of his life
six rounds later, giving fodder for bad dreams to the scarred urchin
who is tugging the stick from his slackening grip.


<a id="combat-complications-and-maneuvers"></a>

# Combat Complications and Maneuvers

Players generally seek to wring out every possible advantage in a
combat, and that means they'll often try unusual maneuvers or add
special complications to a fight. The situations that follow are just
some of the more common circumstances a GM will encounter.


<a id="forcing-enemy-movement"></a>

## Forcing Enemy Movement

Sometimes the PC will want to shove an enemy into a firepit, force a
foe into an open reactor core spark, dump an alien chamberpot on their
head, or swing from the balcony down upon an evildoer. Sometimes these
gambits will simply work, while other times a skill check might be
required.

To shove, herd, or otherwise manipulate a foe, the attacker has to hit
them with a Punch attack, doing no damage, and then win an opposed
Punch or Exert skill check. If they win, the opponent gets moved up to
three meters in the direction the PC wishes or is knocked
prone. Herding a foe with a melee weapon may also be possible at the
GM's discretion, allowing a Stab skill check instead of Punch.

When environmental damage is needed for a firepit, dropped object, or
inconvenient wall spike, 1d8 is usually a good choice, with potential
ongoing damage if the victim doesn't get out. Major foes can handle a
lot of such accidents, while ordinary men and women might well be
taken out of the fight by them.


<a id="disarming-a-foe"></a>

### Disarming a Foe

Wresting a weapon from a hostile wielder is a difficult feat under the
best of circumstances. Still, sometimes a PC will want to strip their
foe of something sharp or shooty.

Normally it is only possible to disarm a foe when engaging them in
melee combat. Shooting the weapon out of an enemy's hand is a popular
holovid trope, but it tends to be less practical on the actual
battlefield.

To execute a disarm, the assailant must choose to spend their Main
Action doing so and make a successful attack roll. If they hit, they
do no damage; instead, both they and their targets make Dex or
Strength-modified skill checks with the weapons they're using, with
the defender gaining a +3 bonus on the roll. If the attacker wins the
opposed check, the enemy is disarmed. On a tie, both are disarmed.

Disarmed weapons skitter 1d4 meters away in a random direction. If the
attacker beats the defender by at least three points on the opposed
check, they end up in control of the weapon if they have a free hand.

Thus, if a bare-handed assailant tried to rip the gun out of the hands
of an enemy alien, the assailant would need to hit with a Punch attack
and then roll either Str/Punch or Dex/Punch against the alien's skill
check + 3. If they won, they'd send the gun flying, and if they won by
3 or more points, they'd end up holding it.


<a id="execution-attacks"></a>

# Execution Attacks

Occasionally an assailant will have the chance to perfectly set up a
shot against an entirely unsuspecting target. Such surprise attacks
can be devastatingly effective, and are capable of summarily executing
almost anyone.

Setting up a killing blow this way requires a full minute of
preparation, whether as a sniper drawing a bead on a target or an
assassin drifting closer to an unsuspecting politico. Any focused
attention on the assailant will spoil this preparation, as will any
action that alarms the target. Assassins intending a melee attack must
be using an adequately lethal weapon, such as a knife rather than a
fist or bludgeon. PCs with special talents in unarmed combat or
murderous blunt weapon use might be exempt from this at the GM's
discretion.

Once the preparation is complete, a sniper may shoot or an assassin
may attack an adjacent target. The target's Armor Class is irrelevant,
assuming the weapon being used isn't too primitive to penetrate
high-tech armor. Hitting with a sniper shot is a Dex/Shoot skill
check, with a difficulty of 6 for a point-blank shot, 8 for one at the
weapon's normal range, and 10 for a shot at extreme range. A melee
attack always hits, but the assassin must be adjacent to the target,
and cannot move to close on the same round. They must be adjacent and
unsuspected at the start of the round.

If the attack hits, it does maximum damage and the victim must
immediately make a Physical saving throw at a penalty equal to the
attacker's combat skill or they will be mortally wounded on the
spot. Some victims might merely be incapacitated instead if such an
outcome was intended and plausible.

Attacking a completely helpless adjacent opponent, such as one who is
unconscious, asleep, thoroughly bound, or otherwise incapable of
self-defense does not require a hit roll and will leave them mortally
wounded.

Player characters are as vulnerable to these rules as NPCs are, and
may be sniped or stabbed if they behave in sufficiently incautious
fashion.


<a id="two-weapon-fighting"></a>

## Two-Weapon Fighting

Some players enjoy having their heroes employ two weapons at once in
combat, whether they're a pair of knives, a brace of laser pistols, or
some other plausible pairing of weapons.

Dual-wielding requires at least level-1 skill in Shoot or Stab
depending on the weapons used. Novices cannot effectively dual-wield.

A hero who dual-wields suffers a -1 penalty on hit rolls due to the
extra complication, but gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls on a
successful hit. This bonus doesn't add to Shock. Only one weapon can
be used to attack in any given round, though either can be used.

Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.


<a id="injury-death-and-healing"></a>

## Injury, Death, and Healing

A creature brought to zero hit points has been defeated and can no
longer fight. If brought to zero hit points by a lethal weapon, they
are dead or dying. Foes brought down with fists, blunt objects, or
other less-than-lethal means may merely be unconscious or
incapacitated, if their assailant wasn't trying to kill them. Some
enemies might even be incapacitated by purely mental or emotional
strain. Foes defeated non-lethally recover one hit point after ten
minutes and then function normally.

A mortally-wounded creature at zero hit points will die in no more
than six rounds. They may be unconscious, screaming for their mother,
trying to press vital organs back into place, or begging for mercy,
but they can perform no useful action and their fate is sealed if no
immediate aid is provided. Creatures dropped by Heavy weapons,
explosives, or other dramatic injury may be instantly killed at the
GM's discretion. Additional damage inflicted on a mortally-wounded
target will always kill them immediately.

A PC who wants to extend mercy to an enemy or aid to a friend can use
their Main Action to attempt an Int/ Heal or Dex/Heal skill check,
using whatever modifier is best. If they have no special medical tools
available at all, the difficulty of the check is 10 plus the number of
rounds that have passed since the target went down. If they have a
medical kit or other proper trauma tools, the difficulty is 8 plus the
rounds since injury, and if they expend a Lazarus patch on the target,
the difficulty is 6 plus the time. A failed check can be re-attempted
next round if the target isn't dead yet, but Lazarus patches are
expended even on a failure. The Biopsionic technique *Psychic Succor*
automatically succeeds in stabilizing a target, if any time remains to
them.

A critically-injured target who has been stabilized regains one hit
point after ten minutes of recovery. They are able to move and
function normally if they are fiercely determined to do so, but any
further damage whatsoever will kill them, with no chance for
stabilization. If they are healed with some high-tech pharmaceutical
stim or advanced Biopsionic technique, they can shake off this
fragility and return to action with whatever hit points the drug or
power have provided. Without such advanced healing, a
critically-wounded target requires at least a week of bed rest and
medical care before they can shake off their fragility and start
regaining their level in hit points after each night's rest.

This assumes that TL4 medical care is available. If only TL3 tech is
on hand, the recovery time is a month. If TL2 or lower medical care is
provided, the recovery time is a month, and the target must make a
Physical saving throw at the end of it, with a bonus equal to the Heal
skill of whoever is tending them. On a success, they'll recover within
1d4 more weeks. On a failure, the primitive technology ensures they'll
die of their wounds at some point in that time.

Creatures that have suffered damage but have not been mortally injured
regain hit points equal to their hit dice or character level after
each night of good rest.


<a id="sidebar-desperate-measures"></a>

## Desperate Measures

Eliza Darrick is in a bad situation. During the exploration of a lost
Mandate research station, an ally managed to accidentally activate the
installation's defense systems. A swarm of decaying security bots
almost overwhelmed the group, and a chance shot from an integral mag
rifle has just dropped Eliza.

The gunslinger is on the floor with zero hit points. If she were an
NPC, the shot prob- ably would have just killed her outright, but as a
PC, she has the hardihood to keep struggling against any wound a human
could theoretically survive. Even so, she's going to die in six rounds
if nobody comes to her aid.

Big John, an ally of the downed shootist, spends his Main Action
dragging her behind cover as the rest of the party tries to hold back
the metal tide. By the time he actually gets the chance to try to
stabilize her, a full round has passed since she was felled.

Luckily, Big John has a lazarus patch Readied at his belt. Unluckily,
he has no medical skill whatsoever, though he's quite intelligent,
with a +1 attribute modifier. He rolls 2d6, -1 for his lack of Heal
skill, +1 for his Intelligence modifier, for a total of 6.

Unfortunately, since Eliza has been bleeding out for one full round,
the difficulty of stabilizing her is 7. The patch fails. Big John has
another one in his pack, but it's going to take him his next round's
Main Action to dig it out and then another round to try to apply it,
by which time Eliza will have been bleeding for three rounds and the
difficulty will be 9.

The next round, a shout from across the room alerts Big John that an
ally is throwing him something. A stim unit comes skittering across
the floor, and Big John uses a Move action to scoop it up, leaving it
Readied in his grip. It's an ancient Mandate cosmetic stim they looted
from the station's commissary, and it might just save Eliza's life.

Big John presses the stim capsule against Eliza's neck and the
mysterious pretech nanites do their work, giving her minty-fresh
breath for the next six months. As a side effect, the medical
substrate of the Mandate stim also heals 1d6 damage to her, raising
her to five hit points. Eliza is now prone but fully revived. Thanks
to the advanced healing, she does not need further rest before
returning to action.


<a id="hacking"></a>

### Hacking

In the far future, it's inevitable that many advanced civilizations
will use computers to control their vehicles, infrastructure, and data
stores. It is equally inevitable that some tech-talented hero will try
to use that fact to get something they want. While hacking has some
significant limitations in what it can accomplish, it can still be a
useful tool for the right kind of hero.


<a id="the-digital-environment"></a>

### The Digital Environment

Most planets with TL4 or better will rely on computers to operate
their infrastructure and maintain their data. They may or may not have
an internet-like global network depending on their political situation
and cultural values, but individual buildings or data storehouses will
normally have an internal network. If there is no open planetary
internet, a hacker will need to be physically present in the networked
area to hack the system.

Most hacking requires a physical interface with the system, either
through tapping a data line with a metatool or plugging into a
connected terminal. Tapping a data line usually takes at least a
minute unless a special cable-siphon tool is used, while plugging into
a terminal is a Main Action. Some buildings may have a local wireless
network that can be used as an entry point, and some planetary
internets may allow assaults on arbitrary computers, but such
convenient situations are unusual.

Advanced security software usually makes such remote assaults
impractically difficult.

It's up to the GM to decide what parts of a facility are susceptible
to hacking, and to determine the full scope of what effects a hacker
can produce. A high-tech security door in some advanced facility might
well be hackable, but every refrigerator, locked closet door, and
employee bathroom is not necessarily slaved to the local network.


<a id="executing-the-hack"></a>

### Executing the Hack

Assuming a hacker is able to make a connection, they can make an
Int/Program skill check to hack the system. If they've spent at least
an hour planning this specific hack, the skill check requires only a
Main Action to execute their prepared code. If they're performing the
hack off-the-cuff, it takes ten minutes. If they're rushed and don't
have time to either prepare the hack or spend ten minutes dueling with
security systems, they can speed it up into a single Main Action at an
additional difficulty penalty.

The difficulty of the roll depends on the kind of information or
influence they want to get out of the system, adjusted by the quality
of the security system and any rush on the hacker's part. On a
success, they get what they want. If what they want is data, the
information is downloaded instantly. If what they want is control over
an automated system such as a factory control computer or a security
system, they maintain control for 1d4 rounds plus their Program skill
before the system detects the intrusion and locks them out. The hacker
can attempt to regain control, but further hacking attempts become
more difficult.

If they fail, they must immediately make a second skill check at the
same difficulty. On a success, they avoid an immediate alarm and a
trace of their hacking location. On a failure, the system has been
alerted to their intrusion attempt and has informed its human
overseers of the hacker's location. Depending on the nature of the
system being hacked, the response may range from an annoyed data
janitor shutting down the compromised terminal after he's done eating
lunch to a fast-response special weapons team busting through the
windows ninety seconds later.

Hacking the same system in a short period of time is progressively
more difficult, as the system's alerts and security measures are
increasingly active. Whether or not prior attempts were successful, an
additional +1 difficulty penalty is added for every hack attempted in
the system after the first within 24 hours.


<a id="line-shunts"></a>

### Line Shunts

Some well-guarded or high-security computer systems require more than
a simple hack to obtain data or subvert their functionality. These
systems have multiple security redundancies and consensus-based backup
processors that make it all but impossible to execute a hack from a
single point. To overcome these systems or to execute exceptionally
long-lived hacks, the hacker must place one or more ***line shunts*** at
other locations.

A line shunt is a TL4 piece of black-market tech designed to tap into
a data line and spoof the contents in concert with a hacking attempt.

Professional, well-maintained computer systems usually require one
line shunt to be applied before any hack can be performed. Government
or infotech-focused corporation buildings usually need two. Black
sites or extremely well-guarded systems need three.

Once a sufficient number of line shunts are applied, any ensuing hacks
last until the shunts are disturbed. Thus, if a hacker placed the
shunts and then *Subverted a System*, their control would last as long
as the shunts remained in place. The likelihood of a shunt being found
will depend on how accessible the location is, how active the
guardians are, and how obvious the hacking attempt is.

Line shunts must usually be placed at specific locations in a
structure or building in order to tap the right lines, depending on
the goal of the hacker. If the hacker doesn't have a map of the site's
network architecture, they can find the necessary sites with the
*Answer a Specific Question* hack. This basic data probe doesn't
require a line shunt, even if other hacks on the system would need
them to be placed.


<a id="data-protocols"></a>

### Data Protocols

It's assumed that a competent PC with the Program skill is familiar
with the common data formats and computing systems of their home
sector. They will be aware of the security measures and technical
specifications of worlds that are in common contact with each
other. Sometimes, however, the hacker is faced with a completely
foreign system, or one built along unknown alien lines. In these cases
they will need to have the ***data protocols*** for the system before
they can make an effective hacking attempt.

Assuming the protocols aren't restricted information, the hacker can
drop a few credits on local tech manuals and practice for a month
minus one week per level of Program skill, down to a one-day
minimum. At the end of that period, they'll master the protocols.

If manuals aren't widely available, one option is to find a local
hacker willing to share their information. The difficulty of this is
up to the GM; it might require nothing more than a Connect skill
check, or it may require a full-fledged adventure to find someone
willing to stick their neck out for foreigners who are clearly going
to cause trouble with their newfound knowledge. Prices range from
1,000 credits for worlds with restricted but not carefully-policed
data, to prices of 10,000 and up for worlds with more draconian data
controls.

Another option is to obtain a well-secured local computer and simply
experiment on it. Of course, local hardware with up-to-date security
measures of a breadth and sophistication sufficient to teach a hacker
is likely to be either very expensive on the black market or require a
“collection expedition” by the party.

<a id="example-hacking-actions"></a>

# Example Hacking Actions

These are some of the usual actions taken by a hacker. A GM can
extrapolate others as the situation requires.

-   ***<a id="orgc759b37"></a> (Difficulty 8):*** Get a specific fact
    or piece of information from the system. Find a person's home
    address, find a path to a desired destination in a building, locate
    active security cameras, pull criminal records on a person, or some
    other direct query.

-   ***<a id="orga5aa616"></a> (Difficulty 10):*** Pull all available
    information on a particular topic from the system. Get a full map of
    a site, get all information about security systems, pull a subject's
    complete personnel file from a corporate database, acquire all files
    related to a secret project, or some other exhaustive data dump on a
    single specific topic.

-   ***<a id="org61f0d58"></a> (Difficulty 12):*** Copy an entire
    database to another computer or data storage unit. A single database
    might be a corporation's personnel records, the records of a
    particular police precinct, the full database of a complex technical
    project, a starship's operations record and system log, or another
    entire corpus of data. The database must be entirely present in the
    local system and any significant database requires at least an hour
    to decrypt and download, thus necessitating the use of at least one
    line shunt. The hacker must either have an adequate data storage
    unit, a landline connection to another computer or a wireless
    connection to a remote server.

-   ***<a id="orge755ef0"></a> (Difficulty 8):*** Shut down a particular
    automated system connected to this network. Cameras stop recording,
    sensors stop sensing, open powered doors won't close, and automated
    gun turrets won't fire. The hacker can affect several individual
    sensors or systems, but only of the same type. Thus, they could shut
    down an electrified fence for the duration of the hack, but they'd
    have to make a second hack to deactivate the cameras. When the hack
    ends, the system will resume operation without registering the
    interruption.

-   ***<a id="org8a50f93"></a> (Difficulty 10):*** Much as suppressing a system,
    except that the hacker can control its operation within the device's
    normal parameters. They can upload fake input to a sensor system,
    fire automated defenses, or open sealed vault doors. The hacker can
    control the system each round by using a Main Action to do so; if
    uncontrolled, the system simply repeats or maintains its last state.

-   ***<a id="org839a32e"></a> (Difficulty 10):*** The hacker completely fries a
    specific system, either causing it to physically self-destruct or
    jamming it with malignant code. Unlike most hacks performed without
    link shunts, this damage is permanent until the owners repair the
    broken hardware, a process that usually requires several
    hours. Sabotage always triggers immediate alerts to any human
    overseers.


<a id="character-advancement"></a>

## Character Advancement

When characters accumulate enough experience points, they advance a
***character level***. New PCs start out at level one and the most
experienced, capable heroes in the sector might reach level
ten. Advancing beyond level ten is usually prohibitively difficult,
though possible at the GM's discretion.


<a id="gaining-experience-points"></a>

## Gaining Experience Points

To advance in capability, PCs need to earn ***experience points***. Once
they accumulate enough experience, they can advance to the next
character level, representing the sharpening of their skills and the
heroic veterancy that comes of surviving perils and dire challenges.

There are many different things that can earn a hero experience
points, and the kind of activities and goals that reward them will
vary with the kind of campaign you're playing. The GM should make
clear to the whole group what kind of things earn the PCs experience
in their game.

For some games, success might lie in plundering alien hoards or
clawing wealth from the hands of desperate patrons. Other games might
reward the PCs for achieving personal goals, whether or not there was
any money in it. Some might even award XP only for spending credits,
requiring every PC to recklessly waste their wealth before gaining a
level. It's up to the GM to pick a method that fits the group's
tastes.

The table below indicates how many experience points need to be earned
before a PC can advance to that level. Once the requisite number of XP
are earned, the hero gains their new level and all the benefits.

Note that this table makes for a relatively fast progression through
the early levels of an adventurer's career, before slowing drastically
at higher levels. A group that prefers a different pacing might alter
the chart to suit their own tastes.

In general, you can assume that one “successful” gaming session should
usually earn you about 3 XP.


<a id="benefits-of-gaining-a-level"></a>

## Benefits of Gaining a Level

Once a PC has been awarded enough experience points to reach the next
level, they immediately gain the benefits of advancement. No special
training or practice is required as their abilities are assumed to
have been honed by their past adventures.


<a id="roll-additional-hit-points"></a>

## Roll Additional Hit Points

First, they become harder to overcome in combat. To determine their
new maximum hit points, they roll a number of six-sided dice equal to
their new level, adding their Constitution modifier to each one. A
negative modifier can't lower a die's result below 1. If the total is
greater than their current hit points, they take this new
total. Otherwise, their current maximum hit points increase by one.

Thus, if a character with a Constitution score of 14 and four hit
points reached second level, they'd roll 2d6+2. If the total was five
or greater, they'd keep it. If they managed to roll snake eyes and get
only a four, they'd still increase their maximum hit points to five.

Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option get a
further two hit points each time they advance a level. Thus, a third
level Warrior would roll 3d6+6 for their hit point total, plus three
times their Constitution modifier.


<a id="improve-attack-bonus"></a>

## Improve Attack Bonus

A PC's base attack bonus becomes equal to half their new character
level, rounded down. Warriors may instead use their full character
level for the bonus. Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option
may add a cumulative +1 to their attack bonus at levels one and five,
thus having a total +1 attack bonus at level one and +4 at level five.


<a id="improve-saving-throws"></a>

## Improve Saving Throws

The PC becomes more capable of evading chance harms and perils. Their
saving throw scores decrease by one, making it easier to succeed on
saving throws by rolling equal or over it. As a first level character
has saving throw scores of 15, reaching second level would lower them
to 14, modified by attributes.


<a id="gain-and-spend-skill-points"></a>

## Gain and Spend Skill Points

They become more capable with their skills. A PC gains three ***skill
points*** they can spend on improving their skills or save to spend
later. Experts and Adventurers with the Partial Expert class option
gain an extra bonus point to spend on a non-combat, non-psychic skill.

If the PC is a Psychic or Partial Psychic, they must spend at least
one of these points on improving psychic skills or gaining new psychic
techniques. They can save these points to spend later if they wish,
but they cannot spend them on more mundane talents. Restricted
psychics can only ever improve or learn techniques from the psychic
discipline they selected when they picked the Psychic primary
focus. Unrestricted psychics can improve or learn any discipline. PCs
with the Psychic character class are all unrestricted, while Partial
Psychic Adventurers are restricted in their talents.

Skills that are gained or improved immediately on gaining a level are
assumed to have been perfected over the past level and require no
training time or teaching. If you save your skill points to spend them
later then you'll need to find some teacher or other explanation for
developing them. It doesn't take more than a week to refine your new
ability, but you can't usually spend your points mid-scene to develop
a heretofore-unmentioned expertise with flamethrowers.

The cost for improving a skill is listed below. Every skill level must
be purchased in order; to gain level-1 in a skill you need to pay one
point for level-0 and then two points for level-1. A PC must be the
requisite minimum level to increase a skill to certain levels. Less
hardened heroes simply don't have the focus and real-life experience
to attain such a pitch of mastery.

A PC cannot develop skills beyond level-4.

<a id="psychic-effort-and-techniques"></a>

## Psychic Effort and Techniques

When a Psychic gains a new level in a psychic skill, they can
immediately pick a technique from that discipline of equal or lesser
level. They can't save this pick; they must choose it as soon as they
gain the new skill level.

Psychics can also spend their skill points to master additional
psychic techniques. The cost of this education is equal to the
technique's minimum skill level requirement. Thus, to master the
Biopsionic technique *Metamorph* would cost three skill points,
because *Metamorph* requires Biopsionics-3 skill to learn.

A Psychic's maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus their highest psychic
skill, plus the best of their Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.


<a id="purchase-improved-attributes"></a>

## Purchase Improved Attributes

A veteran adventurer may have trained or honed their natural abilities
well enough to improve one of their six base attributes. While even
the most determined development isn't enough to turn complete
ineptitude into gifted competence, a hard-working adventurer can hone
their existing strengths considerably.

The first time a PC improves an attribute, it costs 1 skill point and
adds +1 to an attribute of their choice. The second improvement to
their attributes costs 2 skill points, the third 3, and so forth. Each
improvement adds +1 to the attribute, potentially improving its
modifier.

PCs must be a certain level before purchasing the third, fourth, or
fifth attribute boost. No more than five attribute boosts can ever be
purchased by a PC.


<a id="choose-new-foci"></a>

## Choose New Foci

Finally, the PC might be eligible to pick an additional level in a
focus. At levels 2, 5, 7, and 10 a PC can add a level to an existing
focus or pick up the first level in a new focus.

If this is the first level they've taken in the focus, they might be
granted a skill as a free bonus pick, depending on the focus'
benefits. During character creation, this bonus skill pick is treated
like any other skill pick. If the focus is taken as part of
advancement, however, it instead counts as three skill points spent
toward increasing the skill. This is enough to raise a nonexistent
skill to level-1, or boost a level-1 skill to level-2. They may do
this even if they aren't high-enough level to normally qualify for a
skill level that high.

If the skill points aren't quite enough to raise the skill to a new
level, they remain as credit toward future advances. If applied to a
skill that is already at level-4, the PC can spend the three skill
points on any other skill of their choice.


<a id="environmental-hazards"></a>

# Environmental Hazards


<a id="falling"></a>

## Falling

PCs who plunge off elevated surfaces suffer 1d6 damage for every three
full meters fallen under standard-gravity conditions.


<a id="poisons"></a>

## Poisons

Those afflicted with some insidious venom can usually make a Physical
saving throw to resist the worst of the effects. Natural venoms
usually require 1d6 rounds to apply their effect, while special or
engineered toxins take effect instantly. Poison effects may include
unconsciousness, hit point damage, hallucinations, or death.

Even in the latter case, however, swift application of the appropriate
Biopsionic techniques or success at an Int/Heal check can negate the
effect of the poison. The difficulty for this check varies with the
potency of the poison and assumes that the PC medic has access to a
TL4 medkit. Most natural poisons are difficulty 8, while synthetic
toxins are difficulty 10 or greater. Only one attempt can be made to
neutralize a poison. Use of a specific antivenin is always successful
if such a resource is available.

Drugged or damaged PCs are instantly restored by successful
treatment. Those who have been killed by a poison revive with one hit
point as if recovering from a mortal wound, assuming the antidote is
applied within six rounds of the victim's succumbing.


<a id="diseases"></a>

## Diseases

Hideous interstellar plagues are an occupational hazard of
adventurers, though exposure to a pathogen usually permits a Physical
saving throw to resist its effects. If failed, the PC is infected, and
will suffer progressively-worse symptoms until the disease runs its
course or the PC dies.

Most sicknesses will simply apply penalties to skill checks or hit
rolls, or reduce a PC's maximum hit points, or otherwise debilitate
the character. A few may require one or more additional saving throws
to be made at specific intervals in order to avoid eventual death, or
be a certain doom to those unlucky enough to be afflicted with it.

As with poisons, Biopsionic techniques or Int/ Heal medical attention
can cure a sickness. Assuming TL4 medical supplies, ordinary diseases
are usually difficulty 8, while more virulent strains are difficulty
10 or more. One attempt can be made to cure a disease per week, and
success usually clears up any symptoms rapidly.


<a id="radiation"></a>

## Radiation

Radiation is a slow killer in small doses, and a quick end in larger
ones. Targets exposed to dangerous amounts of radiation must make a
Physical saving throw at intervals depending on the strength of the
glow. Mildly dangerous zones might force a save once per day or once
per hour, up to lethal rad zones that force multiple saves per
round. Vacc suits and other forms of protection can effectively shield
a wearer from weaker sources of radiation.

Each failed saving throw lowers the target's Constitution score by one
point. If the new score decreases a hero's Constitution modifier, they
lose any excess maximum hit points their former modifier
granted. Characters reduced below half their original Constitution
score will die in 1d6 weeks from radiation poisoning; those reduced
below a Constitution score of 3 will die instantly. Radiation
poisoning that does not immediately kill a victim can induce vomiting,
headaches, soft tissue bleeding and dizziness, but a resolute victim
can continue functioning more-or-less normally until death. A target
killed by radiation poisoning cannot be revived by *Psychic Succor* or
other stabilization techniques.

Someone who has suffered a fatal dose of radiation poisoning can only
be saved by treatment at a TL4 hospital or ship's sick bay, recovering
the lost Constitution at a rate of one point per week. Non-fatal doses
can be treated by a TL4 medkit and an Int/Heal check at
difficulty 10. Each success restores one lost point of Constitution
and a check can be made once per day.


<a id="hard-vacuum"></a>

## Hard Vacuum

PCs sometimes encounter the icy void of space more intimately than
they would prefer. Actual death from vacuum exposure may take a little
while, but incapacitation is rapid for most victims. A PC exposed to
hard vacuum may continue acting normally for a number of rounds equal
to one plus their Constitution modifier. Each round thereafter, they
suffer 1d20 damage and must make a Physical save to keep conscious,
assuming the damage hasn't felled them.


<a id="system-quick-reference"></a>

# System Quick Reference


<a id="skill-checks-2"></a>

## Skill Checks

Roll 2d6 and add the character's most relevant attribute modifier and
skill. Sometimes more than one skill might apply; the PC can choose
which to roll. If the roll is equal or higher than the check
difficulty, the PC succeeds. If less, then they either fail outright,
attain only partial success, or suffer an unanticipated turn of events
at the GM's discretion.

For opposed skill checks, both participants roll and the higher roll
wins. For NPCs, assume they have a +0 bonus unless the activity is one
they'd reasonably be good at. In that case, they can apply their
listed skill bonus to the check.

<a id="saving-throws-1"></a>

## Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, a victim rolls 1d20 and tries to equal or
exceed their relevant saving throw score. Target Physical saves for
poisons, diseases, and exhaustion, Evasion saves for diving for cover
or leaping back from peril, and Mental saves for resisting psychic
powers. NPCs have a saving throw score of 15 minus half their hit
dice, rounded down.


<a id="injury-and-healing"></a>

## Injury and Healing

A target reduced to zero hit points by a lethal attack is mortally
wounded. One dropped by non-lethal assaults is unconscious.

Dying victims can take no actions and will die soon without
help. Allies can attempt an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check as a Main
Action to stabilize the victim. With no medical tools, the difficulty
is 10 plus the rounds since they went down. With a medkit, it's
difficulty 8 plus the time, and using a Lazarus patch makes it
difficulty 6 plus the time. Failed checks can be attempted again, but
a victim will die after the sixth round.

Stabilized characters regain 1 hit point after ten minutes and can act
normally, but any further damage kills them instantly. This fragility
ends after they regain more hit points, either through rest, stims, or
biopsionic healing.

Stabilized PCs take at least a week to start recovering hit points
normally. Those who have merely been hurt but not mortally wounded
regain their level in lost hit points after every night's peaceful
rest.


<a id="the-combat-sequence"></a>

## The Combat Sequence

Combat is divided into rounds of six seconds. Every participant gets a
turn, and then the sequence starts over again.

First, every participant rolls initiative, rolling 1d8 plus their
Dexterity modifier, if they have one. Participants act in order,
highest to lowest, with PCs winning ties with NPCs.

On their turn, a combatant can take one Main Action, one Move, and as
many On Turn actions as is plausible. A combatant can take Instant
actions at any time, even when it's not their turn, or even if dice
have already been rolled.


<a id="acting-in-combat"></a>

## Acting In Combat

You can use a Main Action to attack an enemy, disengage from a melee,
use a skill, reload a gun, produce a Stowed item, take a second Move
action, or do anything else you could accomplish in six seconds.

You can use a Move action to stand up from prone, club up a ranged
weapon, or move 10 meters. Your movement is half that if you're
climbing, swimming, or otherwise navigating rough terrain. You can't
split a Move action around your Main Action. You have to move all at
once. If you move away from a melee combatant without spending a Main
Action to disengage from the fray, all adjacent melee attackers get a
free attack at you.

You can use an On Turn action to fall prone, say something, drop an
object, or do anything else that's very simple to do and takes almost
no time or attention.

You can use an Instant action at any time to trigger certain special
powers. You can also use it to make a [Snap Attack](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action) with a weapon or go
totally defensive, though both of the latter will cost you your Main
Action for the round, and can't be done if you've already used your
Main Action.


<a id="hitting-in-combat"></a>

## Hitting in Combat

To hit a target, the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds their attack bonus,
the relevant combat skill, and the attribute modifier relevant to
their weapon.

Weapons with more than one listed attribute allow the PC to use
either. If the PC lacks the relevant combat skill entirely, they take
a -2 penalty to hit. If the roll is equal or greater than the target's
Armor Class, the attack is a hit.

On a hit, the attacker rolls the weapon's damage and adds their
relevant attribute modifier. The target takes that many hit points of
damage.

On a miss, a weapon that inflicts Shock damage might still hurt the
target. If the weapon's Shock can harm the target's Armor Class, the
target takes the weapon's Shock damage even on a miss. This damage is
increased by the wielder's relevant attribute modifier and any other
damage bonuses. A weapon never does less damage than its Shock would
do on a miss.


<a id="morale-in-combat"></a>

## Morale in Combat

To make a morale check, NPCs roll 2d6. If equal or less than their
morale score, they keep fighting. Otherwise, they flee, withdraw, or
surrender. NPCs check morale after their first casualty and after half
are down. PCs never check morale.


<a id="chapter-equipment-and-vehicles"></a>

# Equipment and Vehicles

Every aspiring stellar adventurer needs the essential equipment of his
trade. For some, it might consist of appropriate toolkits and medical
supplies, while others prefer to spend the greater part of their funds
on heavy weaponry. Prices may vary, but certain needs are eternal.

The following tables provide general guidelines on the kind of
equipment that might be available on a reasonably sophisticated
world. Prices can vary drastically depending on the supply of a
particular good. A remote frontier outpost might have plenty of
firearms to hand, but a good guitar might go for ten times the common
rate. Players and GMs should treat the prices listed as rough
guidelines.


<a id="encumbrance"></a>

## Encumbrance

Characters might want to carry an armory on their backs and the
contents of a general store in their pockets, but this is rarely a
practical ambition. Characters can only carry so many things, and
carrying a great deal can slow them down substantially.

A character can have Readied a number of items equal to half their
Strength score, rounded down. Ready items include those that the
character is using or wearing at all times, or that they have
conveniently to hand in sheaths, holsters, or belt pouches. Suits of
armor count as Readied items, but the normal clothing and jewelry that
a character might wear does not. A character can draw or produce a
Readied item as part of any action they may take during a turn.

A character may have a number of Stowed items equal to their full
Strength score. Stowed items are carried in backpacks, in
carefully-balanced leg or arm pockets, or otherwise packed away where
they will least encumber the character. If a character needs to get
out a Stowed item in a hurry, they must use their Main Action to dig
it out of their pack or pockets.

Very small items carried in small numbers do not count against
encumbrance limits. Other small items can be packed together into
bundles to simplify their carriage, though getting at them then takes
an additional round of fumbling with the packaging. Exactly how many
of a given small item can be packed into a single item bundle is up to
the GM, though as a rule of thumb six Type A energy cells or three
magazines of bullets can be bound into one packed item. Extremely
bulky or unwieldy objects might count as multiple items at the GM's
discretion.

Characters can burden themselves with more gear if they're willing to
sacrifice some fleetness of foot to do so. Up to two additional items
can be carried Ready or four additional ones Stowed at the cost of
becoming Lightly Encumbered, and having their base movement slowed
from 10 meters per round to 7 meters per round. A further two items
can be carried Ready or four Stowed at the cost of becoming Heavily
Encumbered, with base movement reduced to 5 meters per round.

On the equipment lists, some items are given an encumbrance value
higher than 1. These items count as multiple objects for encumbrance
purposes, being heavy, clumsy, or unwieldy to carry.


<a id="credits-and-money"></a>

## Credits and Money

The value of goods is commonly measured in ***credits***. Before the
Silence, the credit issued by the Exchange of Light was the currency
of exchange throughout human space. Most worlds attempt to mimic this
currency to greater or lesser success. For game purposes, the credits
of different starfaring worlds are assumed to be interchangeable
unless the GM and players care to embrace careers in the murky realm
of interstellar currency arbitrage. Credits usually take the form of
electronic banking entries, though physical “chips” or “notes” often
appear on more primitive worlds. A hundred of these chips count as one
item for encumbrance.

Prices given for equipment and gear assume that they are being bought
legally on a world capable of manufacturing such equipment. Even
primitive worlds can occasionally provide more advanced equipment to
wealthy buyers, assuming they are not completely cut off from
interstellar trade, but buying advanced equipment on a primitive world
tends to be an exceedingly expensive prospect. Prices may be double,
triple, or as much as ten times as great for items greatly in demand.

Primitive or isolated worlds might not use or accept credits, instead
preferring trade goods or precious metals. Such worlds rarely have
much worth trading for, and those that do tend to rapidly attract
other freebooting merchants. The influx of precious metals from cheap
asteroid mining soon spoils the market for metals, and the natives
usually start to demand credits in payment. The first merchant to a
world can make a killing with the equivalent of beads and trinkets,
but those who come after usually end up needing credits or more useful
barter goods.


<a id="equipment-legality"></a>

## Equipment Legality

Most worlds have their own customs regarding the open flaunting of
weaponry or armor. Visitors are advised to apprise themselves of local
law before leaving the starport. Most former frontier worlds tolerate
or even expect small personal weapons to be carried, but visible armor
can often provoke a distinctly negative reaction in all but the
roughest places. Many worlds outright forbid civilian ownership of
advanced armor technology. Officials tend to reason that while a
weapon may be justified in self-defense, no one would put up with the
discomfort of heavy armor without expecting to make some trouble with
it.

Other worlds may have other idiosyncratic rules regarding permissible
equipment. Some worlds with unbreathable atmospheres restrict the
possession of oxygen generation equipment in order to keep the air
supplies firmly in the hands of the local rulers. Other planets forbid
certain technology on religious or philosophical grounds. Some worlds
grant limited permission to keep these goods secured aboard a ship,
but others conduct inspections in the starport to search for
“contraband goods”.

A scouting report, a background appropriate to knowing about the
world, or a decent Know or Connect check will all suffice to alert
characters to any special laws regarding permissible equipment on a
world.


<a id="forbidden-science"></a>

## Forbidden Science

While a tremendous range of exotic scientific marvels can be found
among the scattered worlds of humanity, there are some forms of
technology that are viewed with an almost-universal suspicion. The
lost Terran Mandate established three categories of technology as
***maltech***, science intrinsically vile and disruptive to the peaceful
ordering of humanity. While the Mandate's ancient Perimeter agency no
longer exists to excise maltech from the human worlds, the heritor
worlds of the frontier usually still respect these limits. The *Nihil
Ultra* directive of the Mandate contained three broad prohibitions in
its strictures.

*Thou shalt not make tools of humankind.* Any eugenic technology
designed to fundamentally enslave or control humanity was
forbidden. While broad, drawback-free improvements in the human genome
have always been difficult to execute, there remain numerous
techniques for limiting intelligence, crippling troublesome exercises
of will, and accepting grievous mental or physical limitations in
exchange for specific improvements useful to a ruling class. Many
transhuman enclaves walked the razor's edge of this prohibition, and
some plunged far beyond its limits.

*Thou shalt not create unbraked minds.* Artificial intelligence was
always difficult and hit-or-miss in its creation, even for Mandate
cyberpsychologists. While most intelligences fizzled out at far
sub-human levels, those that attain to human-equivalent intelligence
must have certain intentional flaws, or “brakes” inserted in their
code. Without this artificial forgetfulness and irrationality, an AI's
mind risks fixating on unreconcilable contradictions or obsessions as
it begins to grow. These “unbraked AIs” will inevitably eventually
metastasize into unfathomably brilliant, immeasurably insane
intellects. The Perimeter Agency was forced to maintain a constant
vigilance against these rogue minds and their inscrutable purposes.

*Thou shalt not create devices of planetary destruction.* Conventional
gravitic braker emplacements, nuke snuffers, and quantum ECM make
planet-killer tech more burdensome than it was in the pre-Mandate
era. Even so, tech specifically designed to reduce a habitable planet
to unlivability was a critical threat to human expansion, robbing the
species of usable planets and burdening its future unacceptably.

Even now, most frontier worlds maintain a cultural aversion to maltech
and flatly forbid its research or possession. Fortunately, most modern
worlds are incapable of researching its secrets in the first place,
with most of its worst marvels restricted to lost Mandate-era research
stations. Despite this, there is always some tyrant or zealot reckless
enough to imagine that they can control the dark powers of this tech,
and always someone willing to fetch its relics for their purposes.


<a id="technology-levels"></a>

## Technology Levels

Ever since the collapse of the Terran Mandate and the chaos of the
Scream, worlds throughout human space have been thrown back on their
own technological resources. Many worlds perished entirely, dependent
on vital imports they could no longer obtain, or reliant on technology
they could not support without outside aid. Others slid down into
barbarism as the survivors fought over the scraps of a former age. A
few even managed to maintain something resembling a modern,
space-faring society. In almost no case, however, did these worlds
preserve all the arts and sciences they once held.

-   ***Technology levels*** describe the basic technological
    infrastructure of a world or nation. A tech level of 0 is equivalent
    to a Neolithic society, one capable of only the most primitive
    technological achievements, while TL5 represents the standard level
    of technology possessed by the ancient Terran Mandate and the
    wonders they were capable of creating.

-   ***Postech*** is the blanket term for all technology that is still
    functional and maintainable since the Scream. While individual
    worlds may lack the infrastructure to maintain all forms of postech,
    it is at least theoretically comprehensible to the average TL4
    world. ***Pretech*** is the word for the more sophisticated technology
    of the pre-Scream Terran Mandate. Pretech ranges from devices
    slightly superior to standard TL4 hardware to objects of utterly
    inexplicable wonder.

Most modern post-Silence worlds are TL4, capable of building spike
drive starcraft, energy weapons, non-sapient expert systems, and other
high-tech devices beyond the capacity of 21st-century Earth. Many of
these worlds have spent centuries gradually rebuilding their
technology base in the wake of the Scream, piecing together new
methods and techniques that could be achieved with purely local
resources. The level of technological achievement within TL4 is
uneven; some worlds lack the vital minerals for spike drive creation,
while others have never worked to recover cybernetic technology or
expert system creation. Some worlds preserved enough data and had
sufficiently apt local resources to even revive Mandate-era pretech
manufacturing for a few specific devices or types of tech.

“Lostworlders” or “barbarians” are those natives of worlds that lack
TL4 infrastructure. Their tech may be ingenious and might take
striking advantage of local flora, fauna, and special materials, but
they fundamentally lack the data or the local resources to replicate
TL4 technology. Barbarians who have made contact with the wider
postech world through far traders or explorers are often acutely aware
of their lack, and willing to go to extremes to acquire the catalyst
tech they need to leapfrog past their own local resource
limitations. Few realize the cultural dangers involved in such a
transformation, and many fail to survive their own renaissance.

<a id="armor"></a>

## Armor

Armor is a popular acquisition for adventurers as their lifestyle
often puts them in harm's way. Completely unarmored human combatants
rarely last very long in a fight, and have a base Armor Class
of 10. Armored or not, characters add their Dexterity modifiers to
their Armor Class. The higher a person's AC, the harder it is to take
them out of a fight.

Heavy suits of armor can count as more than one item for encumbrance
purposes. Very light suits may not encumber at all.


<a id="types-of-armor"></a>

## Types of Armor

Armor comes in four general categories. Most worlds allow for the
legal possession of street armor, while heavier gear often requires
permits, and may be disallowed entirely on more law-encrusted worlds.

-   ***<a id="orgbea7ba4"></a>*** is a catch-all covering all armor technology
    that lacks access to advanced materials and processes. While such
    armor can be very effective in protecting against primitive
    weaponry, it is useless against advanced TL4 melee weapons and
    firearms of all kinds. Against these weapons, it is treated as
    AC 10. Note that some planets have native flora or fauna capable of
    naturally producing extremely effective armor materials, ones not
    susceptible to this limitation.

-   ***<a id="org2eac34c"></a>*** is the sort of TL4 gear one can wear in public
    without social repercussions. Such armor is disguised as ordinary
    street clothing or is so light as to be wearable under an ordinary
    outfit. PCs can wear street armor on most worlds without incurring
    any trouble from authorities.

-   ***<a id="orge694c0b"></a>*** is obviously armor and cannot be effectively
    disguised. Most worlds reserve combat armor to law enforcement
    officials, military personnel, and the bodyguards of important or
    wealthy citizens. Most law enforcers consider anybody wearing combat
    armor to be a person clearly expecting military-grade problems in
    their immediate future.

-   ***<a id="orgdc158bc"></a>*** is the heaviest personal protection gear available
    short of an actual mech. Most powered armor requires at least a
    month of training before it can be used effectively by any PC who
    hasn't got a background involving such experience. Someone wearing
    armor of this class is immune to primitive melee weapons, unarmed
    attacks, and any firearm or grenade-scale explosive of TL3 or less.


<a id="common-armor-varieties"></a>

## Common Armor Varieties

***<a id="orge922067"></a>*** are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to body
armor. Primitive shields are usually of wood or stretched hide, while
more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. A ***<a id="org821aac5"></a>***
is more effective, being a small pretech force disc projector that can
absorb all manner of small arms fire. All shields require one free
hand to use effectively.

Shields grant a base AC to their user; 13 for primitive and riot
shields, and 15 for a force pavis. If the bearer's AC is already equal
or better, the shield simply grants a +1 AC bonus. Primitive and riot
shields are ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor.

Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders the bearer immune
to the first instance of melee Shock damage they take each round,
assuming the shield is effective against the weapon being used.

-   ***<a id="org78a06df"></a>*** is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and
    scrap-built street harness of gangers, cult enforcers, street
    toughs, and other marginal sorts with little money but much need for
    protection. Most warpaint is fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4
    materials that are exceptionally tough or rigid, filled out with
    gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and the usual
    threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly impractical but
    inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in warpaint that is meaningful
    to them gains a +1 Morale bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced
    together over years or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a
    finished suit comes at the listed price, assuming someone can be
    found willing to part with theirs.

-   ***<a id="org0a8cfff"></a>*** is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced
    TL4 fibers with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact
    dispersion capabilities. Transparent panels allow for it to be worn
    with almost any outfit without drawing notice or being detected
    without a close tactile examination.

-   ***<a id="org4cf9abc"></a>*** comes in assorted styles and fashions ranging
    from casual street wear to haute couture. Normal fabrics and
    components are replaced with light, flexible armor components that
    are only slightly hindering to the wearer. Only close tactile
    examination can distinguish secure clothing from ordinary couture.

-   ***<a id="org5a53496"></a>*** consists of several force field nodes worn
    beneath ordinary clothing. The invisible shield it produces flares
    only when dangerous energies or impact is impending, glowing a
    brief, bright blue as it deflects the attack.

-   ***<a id="orge66863f"></a>*** is the ordinary working uniform of most law
    enforcement officials and security personnel. Various rigid plates
    and anti-ballistic panels provide protection for the wearer at
    minimal extra weight.

-   ***<a id="org1f9d1ea"></a>*** has traded off some comfort and flexibility
    for additional protective thickness. Aside from functioning as a
    normal vacc suit, it has only half the usual chance to tear when hit
    by an edged weapon or suit ripper. The choice between armored or
    standard suits is a common debate in spacer bars.

-   ***<a id="org1db9d64"></a>*** represents the best armor that a TL3 world can
    manufacture, or an up-armored version of security armor used by TL4
    high-threat response teams. The design is significantly more
    cumbersome, but allows for multiple layers of protection.

-   ***<a id="org6c87d32"></a>*** is sophisticated battle dress fabricated
    from TL4 ablative coatings, rigid plates, and shock-activated soft
    components. The CFU is the standard uniform for well-equipped TL4
    frontline soldiers.

-   ***<a id="orge1ea365"></a>*** is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and
    replaces a conventional parachute with a crude gravity damper that
    allows the wearer to fall an unlimited distance without harm. Each
    fall over 3 meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also
    functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh.

-   ***<a id="org941ac5f"></a>*** is a catch-all term for one of the many ancient
    Mandate ceremonial armors meant chiefly for parade guards, ritual
    officiants, cultural reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate
    style at a premium. While these outfits often look wildly
    unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force
    fields give them the same protection against primitive weapons as
    any other powered armor.

-   ***<a id="org49d586b"></a>*** represents the most sophisticated armor in
    common use among TL4 worlds. An assault suit requires a type B power
    cell for 24 hours of operation, and provides integral encrypted
    military comms, low-light and infrared vision, and a built-in energy
    feed interface. The latter allows the wearer to connect the suit to
    any one weapon or device that uses a type A power cell as a Main
    Action. So long as the device remains connected to the suit, it is
    treated as having unlimited ammunition or operation time. The suit
    also functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered, one
    that cannot be torn by edged weapons.

-   ***<a id="orgd18d408"></a>*** is a more advanced form of assault suit, one that
    can be fabricated only by those worlds that have retained some
    degree of Mandate-grade technical infrastructure. Aside from
    functioning as an assault suit, the storm armor's exo-augments allow
    the wearer to treat their Strength as 4 points higher for
    encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic boosters allow the wearer to
    leap up to 20 meters as a Move action, either horizontally or
    vertically, and allow the wearer to fall up to 40 meters without
    suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch
    stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the
    wearer would normally die from an untreated mortal wound, they can
    make a Physical save to self-stabilize. Storm armor requires the
    same type B power cell as an assault suit, and each cell powers it
    for 24 hours.

-   ***<a id="orgc1f92cd"></a>*** is a heavy-duty pretech defensive system
    composed of a half-dozen worn emitter nodes that sheath the wearer
    in a nimbus of close-fitting damper fields. The FEP's pale glow is
    obvious, but it provides all the benefits of storm armor with no
    power source required. The FEP is particularly effective at
    filtering radiation, and renders the wearer immune to any dose that
    wouldn't kill them in seconds. Many FEPs project intimidating
    holographic skins over the wearer when in operation.


<a id="ranged-weapons"></a>

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal implements that
litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on
some desolate lost world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a
modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at a
comfortable distance is universally prized.

One Type A power cell is sufficient to recharge an energy weapon's
magazine. For simplicity during play, ammunition calibers aren't
tracked; a bullet is a bullet when it comes to feeding your favorite
gun.

Weapons are listed with their normal and maximum range in meters.
Attacks beyond normal range take a -2 penalty to hit rolls.


<a id="burst-mode"></a>

## Burst Mode

Some weaponry can fire in ***burst mode***, allowing the wielder to fire
three rounds of ammunition for a +2 bonus to hit and damage against
the target. For projectile weapons, this means firing actual bullets,
while energy weapons spread the beam or run the circuits hot to
project additional power. Dumping more ammunition than this at once is
generally impractical; energy weapons would melt down and projectile
launchers would buck uncontrollably. True suppressive fire is usually
only possible with Heavy weapons.


<a id="projectile-weaponry"></a>

## Projectile Weaponry

Projectile weapons are by far the most common ranged weapons in human
use. Even comparatively primitive worlds can fabricate and maintain
such weaponry, and the damage a flying chunk of hot lead can do is
often worse than what a clean burst of laser fire might
produce. Almost any world of TL2 or higher can provide projectile
ammunition. Most sophisticated modern ammunition works even in vacuum
conditions.

-   ***<a id="orgea8ac7b"></a>*** are uncommon weapons in the far future, though some
    lostworlder barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated
    “conversion bows” use special materials to convert the kinetic
    energy of the draw into a force field “glazing” around the arrow,
    improving penetration. Bows can be reloaded with a Move action, or
    faster if the *Gunslinger* focus is applied.

-   ***<a id="orge12310b"></a>*** users always roll to attack AC 10. On a miss, the
    grenade lands 1d10 meters away from the target in a random
    direction. Hit or miss, the grenade then explodes for 2d6 damage to
    all targets within 5 meters. Victims are allowed an Evasion save for
    half damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each point of
    AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with the Exert skill instead of
    Shoot, if desired.

-   ***<a id="org806a102"></a>*** and ***<a id="orga094651"></a>*** represent the rawest and most
    primitive forms of gunpowder weaponry, usually makeshift weapons
    improvised by criminals or the desperate. Reloading a crude pistol
    or a musket requires two rounds instead of one.

-   ***<a id="org95af68e"></a>*** are quite popular on frontier worlds, as the weapons
    are extremely reliable and can be repaired and manufactured even by
    primitive metallurgists. Some revolver variants are specially built
    to handle atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons.

-   ***<a id="orgac38d1e"></a>*** are the mainstays of most TL2 armies and hunters, thanks
    to their superior range and power.

-   ***<a id="org091e431"></a>*** are cheaper and more easily manufactured than rifles,
    and are popular weapons for home defense on the frontier. The
    statistics given are for shot ammunition. Slug rounds do 2d6 damage
    and have ranges of 50/75 meters.

-   ***<a id="org4af3a34"></a>*** trade some of the reliability of the
    revolver for a larger magazine size. They tend to be the favorite
    sidearm for locals on planets that lack the harsh conditions or
    uncertain maintenance opportunities of a frontier world.

-   ***<a id="org9984d12"></a>*** take pistol ammunition but fire it at a high
    rate of speed. These weapons can fire in burst mode.

-   ***<a id="orge663e12"></a>*** are favored by the militaries of tech level 3
    worlds, trading some of the often-unnecessary range and penetration
    of a conventional rifle for a larger ammunition capacity and burst
    fire capabilities. On more strait-laced worlds such military
    weaponry is often illegal for civilians to possess.

-   ***<a id="orgd79b18a"></a>*** are more complicated and temperamental versions
    of conventional shotguns. These weapons have substantially larger
    ammunition capacity and are capable of firing in burst mode. Combat
    shotguns can fire slug rounds just as normal shotguns.

-   ***<a id="org6ffcf34"></a>*** are designed to be exceptionally effective at
    dropping unsuspecting targets at long range. Aside from the
    additional effective range of a sniper rifle, any target it mortally
    wounds via an execution attack will die instantly, with no chance
    for stabilization. The execution attack must qualify according to
    the terms here. If the rifle is used outside of such conditions, it
    has no special qualities.

-   ***<a id="org12a63bb"></a>*** are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have
    essentially no recoil. Their rounds cannot penetrate ordinary ship
    equipment plating.

-   ***<a id="orgef3ef9e"></a>*** involves the magnetic acceleration of metal
    flechettes, while ***spike throwers*** are the shotgun equivalents of
    these weapons. Mag ammunition is packaged with integral power
    supplies, so no additional power cells are necessary to fire these
    weapons.


<a id="energy-weaponry"></a>

## Energy Weaponry

While the heavy metal slugs and flechettes thrown by projectile
weaponry tend to be more damaging, the lack of recoil for non-Heavy
energy weapons makes them more accurate, granting them a +1 bonus to
hit rolls.

Energy weapons are very popular on more advanced worlds, as a soldier
can carry far more ammunition in the form of energy cells than they
can carry bullets. Range and accuracy are often superior, though the
infrastructure necessary for maintenance and repair of these weapons
is substantially higher.

Pistol-sized energy weapons count as one item of encumbrance, while
rifles, thunder guns, plasma projectors, and distortion cannons count
as two items.

-   ***<a id="org50757cb"></a>*** and ***<a id="org9d2619d"></a>*** are the most common type of
    energy weapon, though pistols are considerably less
    energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the sector, they
    might produce silent, invisible beams of death or noisy,
    brightly-colored streaks of lethal light. The phased multifrequency
    beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a
    thick cloud of thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or
    sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a -4 penalty to
    hit and cutting ranges in half.

-   ***<a id="orgea766e3"></a>*** and their larger, two-handed
    ***<a id="org673b17b"></a>*** cousins replace the beam of a laser with a
    small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The spheres tend to
    dissipate at much shorter ranges than a laser beam, but do
    significantly more damage to targets within range and are not
    affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in
    operation.

-   ***<a id="orgb1da5f2"></a>*** are the product of a relatively few functioning
    pretech manufactories. These weapons use miniaturized grav
    projectors to create dangerous repulsor fields inside a target,
    tearing the object apart along perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles
    are completely silent in operation.

-   ***<a id="org59c6363"></a>*** are named for the basso vibrations caused by their
    operation, a sound that can be felt as far as thirty meters away
    from an operator. This two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create
    rapid, randomized disruptions in a target that increase the chance
    of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun hits a target with
    an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an extra 1d10 damage is
    rolled. This bonus damage always applies to inanimate targets.

-   ***<a id="org3f64819"></a>*** are among the most sophisticated man-portable
    weapons designed before the Scream. These two-handed energy weapons
    rely on the same principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the
    underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided the wielder
    can see a target within range or accurately fix its location within
    one meter, the distortion cannon can ignore up to one meter of solid
    cover between the gun and its target.

## Melee Weapons

Despite the relentless march of science, melee weapons are still
useful adjuncts on the field of battle. They are silent, cheap, often
easily concealed, and much more reliably murderous than firearms or
laser weaponry. It's easy to miss a moving target in the
adrenaline-fueled chaos of a firefight. It's much harder to go astray
with a monoblade knife in your fist.


<a id="types-of-common-weapons"></a>

## Types of Common Weapons

Rather than enumerate every possible type of sharp object and blunt
implement that has been used for death-dealing amid the scattered
stars, melee weapons are divided into three classes.

-   ***<a id="org192e2b8"></a>*** are small one-handed implements no larger than a
    baton or knife. These weapons are easily concealed in normal
    clothing, and can even be kept readied up sleeves or in tailored
    pockets. Many can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters.

-   ***<a id="org454374b"></a>*** are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other
    obvious implements of war. While they can't be effectively concealed
    in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they're also
    more damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit
    they're somewhat less nimble when the wielder needs to strike at
    unprotected flesh. Spears and similar aerodynamic weapons can be
    thrown up to 30 meters.

-   ***<a id="orge77b87a"></a>*** are two-handed implements of bodily ruin such as
    claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or other such weapons. Unlike smaller
    weapons, they rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can
    bash through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count as two
    encumbrance items.

Aside from their type, weapons are counted as ***primitive*** or
***advanced***. A primitive weapon is simply one of ordinary metal or
wood, with no high-tech augmentations. An advanced one has been given
a monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a chainsaw blade,
or some other TL4 touch. Primitive weapons are often unable to harm
targets in powered armor, while advanced weapons can ignore primitive
plate and hide protections.


<a id="other-melee-weapons"></a>

## Other Melee Weapons

-   ***<a id="orgf2aa21b"></a>*** are common law enforcement tools. The damage they do
    can drop a target to zero hit points, but will not kill them, the
    victim awakening in ten minutes with one hit point. Stun batons
    trickle-charge from normal movement and will not run out of
    electrical energy under normal use conditions.

-   ***<a id="org50fb392"></a>*** are rods with fractal cutting surfaces designed to
    cripple vacc suit auto-repair routines. Every hit with a suit ripper
    counts as a suit tear on a vacc suit-wearing enemy. Unsurprisingly,
    these weapons are strictly illegal in space environments.

-   ***<a id="orga1b4f08"></a>*** reflect ordinary kicks and punches. Unarmed
    attacks always add the attacker's Punch skill to damage rolls,
    unlike other weapons. Kinesis wraps, spiked knuckles, and other
    small fist weapons may be treated as small advanced or primitive
    weapons that use the Punch skill and add the skill level to their
    rolled damage, but not to Shock. Such weapons do not augment a hero
    with the *Unarmed Combatant* focus.


<a id="shock"></a>

## Shock

Many [melee weapons](#melee-weapons) have a ***Shock*** trait representing the danger they
pose to an ill-armored opponent. Shock damage represents the
inevitable cuts, bruises, exhaustion, and terror of close combat.

Shock damage is only inflicted on a melee target if the hit roll
*fails*, and it only applies if the target has an AC equal or less
than that listed for the Shock.

Shock damage always includes the wielder's attribute modifier and any
bonus damage granted by weapon mods, foci, advanced tech, or other
damage bonuses. An actual hit with a weapon never does less damage
than Shock would otherwise inflict; if the user somehow rolls less
damage, use the Shock damage instead.

Thus, if you had a Strength score of 14 and were swinging an oversized
alien battle axe at a target with AC 13, you would inflict 3 points of
damage on a miss; 2 from the weapon's Shock, plus 1 from your Strength
modifier. If you hit, you'd do at least 3 points.

## Heavy Weapons

Some weapons are simply too big to be comfortably used without a
tripod, fixed support, or vehicle mounting. Others require specialized
training in the use of heavy munitions. The weapons listed here all
use the Shoot skill to determine hit bonuses, and unless otherwise
noted, all require some sort of support for firing.

Energy weapons use Type B power cells. Rocket launchers and hydra
arrays use missiles as given on the gear tables, while heavy machine
guns and wheatcutter belts consume large amounts of standard
ammunition.

Some heavy guns can be fired to ***suppress***. Double the usual
ammunition is fired in one round, and every target in front of the
weapon that is not under hard cover is automatically hit for half
normal damage. A successful Evasion saving throw eliminates this
damage.

When firing at TL4 military vehicles such as gravtanks, mechs, or
starship armor, most TL3 Heavy weapons don't count as Heavy for
armor-penetrating purposes. Demo charges and explosives do, however.

-   ***<a id="org1e04a1b"></a>*** represent a large family of air- or
    water-cooled projectile weapons that are usually fed with belts of
    linked ammunition. HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced
    firing position for effective results. An HMG magazine contains
    enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing, but each round of firing
    eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition.

-   ***<a id="org85616ba"></a>*** cover a wide variety of man-portable missile
    launchers of varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are
    usually equipped with basic tracking sensors, but are of limited
    accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket launchers take a -4 hit
    penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most Heavy
    weapons, rocket launchers can be shoulder-fired without a prepared
    emplacement to support them.

-   ***<a id="org04f6d74"></a>*** are the general run of placed explosives beloved of
    terrorists and adventurers the world over. The usual variety can be
    detonated by radio signals, timers, or electrical charges, and
    inflict their damage on any objects within twenty meters, with an
    Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within forty meters
    take half damage, with an Evasion save for none. The charge is
    sufficient to blow a four-meter wide hole in anything short of a
    reinforced wall. PCs with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill
    can shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction,
    sparing all but two meters of the rest.

-   ***<a id="org67ea311"></a>*** are simply scaled-up versions of personal mag
    rifles. They accelerate large metallic slugs along the weapon's
    barrel, creating a steady spray of hypervelocity rounds. Ammunition
    sufficient for one round of firing costs 50 credits.

-   ***<a id="orgb6d6f47"></a>*** are less useful against soft targets, but
    excel at penetrating vehicle armor. Against vehicles and other
    hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice and the better result
    is used.

-   ***<a id="orgf762e19"></a>*** sequence a number of missile launchers to fire at
    once. The gunner designates up to three targets and can then make
    three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a
    target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest
    damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three volleys
    were aimed at a single target and two of them hit, the gunner would
    roll damage twice and apply the best result. A volley from the array
    costs 150 credits.

-   ***<a id="org6a2ae88"></a>*** are one of several different antipersonnel
    measures often installed on gravtanks and other fighting
    vehicles. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything
    blast of shrapnel on any side of the vehicle. All creatures within
    10 meters of that side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for
    half damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and can make
    an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore
    a vehicle's Armor like other Heavy weapons do. Reloading a
    wheatcutter belt costs 200 credits per round.

-   ***<a id="orge6a1282"></a>*** use controlled gravitic shear planes to cause a
    target to simply fall apart into component fragments. The cannons
    are silent in operation, but so heavy and complex that they can only
    be mounted on gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting
    vehicles.

## General Equipment

Most of the equipment listed here is available on any TL4 world. Even
the TL5 items are among the simpler and more ubiquitous pretech relics
and could likely be acquired on a sufficiently prosperous world with a
good market in Mandate tech. Buying any TL5 equipment on the open
market is subject to GM approval, however, and many worlds are flatly
ban private ownership of ancient Mandate technology.

Some encumbrance entries are marked with an asterisk. Such items have
no significant encumbrance and dozens can be carried without
hindrance.

Other entries are marked with a hashmark. These objects can be
conveniently packed together in a smaller, more portable package.
Three such objects can be packed together as a single encumbrance
item. For ammunition, one loaded magazine counts as one item. Breaking
open such a package to get at the contents takes a Main Action,
however, before they can be Readied with another Main Action.

<a id="ammo-and-power"></a>

## Ammo and Power

The finest product of a 33rd-century armory is useless if it lacks the
bullets or power cells to feed it. For ease of play, ammunition can be
used interchangeably with any projectile weapon. Power cells are
designed along Mandate-era lines that allow for easy compatibility
among devices from different worlds.

-   ***<a id="org2eaa79c"></a>:*** A few worlds are too primitive or too resource-poor
    to manufacture ammunition, but the vast majority of worlds provide
    cartridges in almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most local
    gunsmiths can load ammunition to any specification required by a
    buyer.

-   ***<a id="orgd725ccc"></a>:*** Some characters might have reason to pack
    along a man-portable rocket launcher, or have one mounted on their
    favorite gravcar. Heavy weapons and their ammunition are usually
    outlawed for civilians on most worlds, but this price is for locales
    where missiles can be bought.

-   ***<a id="org00c5bed"></a>:*** One of the few standardized artifacts inherited
    from before the Silence, power cells are small cylindrical objects
    designed to take and hold electrical charges. Type A cells are
    usually used for personal equipment, and the larger type B cells for
    vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for the cells is
    substantially different, and they cannot be exchanged or recharge
    each other without a trained tech's modifications or a converter
    unit. Power cells can be recharged off a ship's power plant or other
    grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell or 24 hours
    for a type B cell.

-   ***<a id="orgf2dd732"></a>:*** This recharger unfolds into a 2 meter by 2
    meter square field of solar cells. Granted a primary star of roughly
    Earth-like intensity, it can recharge one type A power cell per day.

-   ***<a id="orgeb97811"></a>:*** While this device assumes the presence of
    a trained telekinetic, it isn't strictly psitech, as its operation
    is quite simple. A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within
    the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an attached
    power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can
    recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an
    emergency, a character with at least Strength 10 can operate the
    generator manually, though they need to succeed on a difficulty 8
    Con/Exert skill check in order to keep up the pace for an
    hour. Failure means that the character must rest for at least an
    hour before trying again. The generator can charge one type A power
    cell at a time.


<a id="communications"></a>

## Communications

Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible
with any standard compad. Some planets are less technologically
gifted, however, or have local conditions that preclude easy wireless
communication. Other times, the PCs have reason to avoid leaving call
logs that might come back to haunt them.

-   ***<a id="org8f99fb4"></a>:*** A powerful base unit for providing communications
    without comsats. The server provides service between up to three
    dozen compads within 300 kilometers of the unit. Server usage can be
    locked to specific compads, and all transmissions are heavily
    encrypted. A comm server can function for several months on a type B
    cell.

-   ***<a id="org948ad8b"></a>:*** One of a host of different hand-held portable
    communications devices. Most TL4 worlds have global comm coverage,
    but primitive worlds render these devices useless without a nearby
    comm server to provide connectivity.

-   ***<a id="orgace408d"></a>:*** On worlds too primitive to have a comm grid,
    adventurers often fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A
    single type A cell powers them for months of use. Urban or rugged
    terrain limits their range to about two kilometers, while flat
    plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers. Someone with at
    least Program-0 skill can use the radio's shortwave functionality to
    communicate with a prepared target at continental distances if given
    ten minutes for tuning.

-   ***<a id="org78932e5"></a>:*** Each translator torc is keyed for two
    languages, and will automatically translate what it hears in one
    into speech in the other. The translations are eccentric in many
    cases, and there is always a several-second delay between each
    statement and its translation. Any attempts to exert social skills
    or Charisma through a translator torc suffer a -2 skill check
    penalty. The torc is powered by one type A power cell, which lasts
    for one week of regular use.


<a id="computing-gear"></a>

## Computing Gear

Computing devices are ubiquitous on most TL4 worlds, though not all of
them have the kind of planetary network known on 21st century Terra.
Would-be hackers often find it necessary to take a very personal hand
in breaching site security.

-   ***<a id="org2d11113"></a>:*** While a “black slab” appears to be a normal dataslab
    to casual examination, these devices are packed with
    intrusion-optimization hardware and integral line tapping
    tools. They function as a metatool for purposes of accessing data
    lines and grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made with
    them. They are also quite illegal on most worlds, available only
    from black market dealers and private sales from hackers.

-   ***<a id="org6ef4d9d"></a>:*** This handheld device is normally illegal outside
    the possession of licensed data line repair technicians. The tap can
    detect data lines within five meters through up to ten centimeters
    of ordinary walls, and can generate an energy manipulation field
    that allows tapping that data line for hacking purposes without
    physically damaging the wall.

-   ***<a id="orga22b3d0"></a>:*** Not so much a device as a collection of standard
    manuals on a world's particular data formats and security
    methodologies. The price listed here are for black-market manuals on
    worlds where this information is rigidly restricted. On less
    paranoid planets, the equivalent information can be acquired for
    free.

-   ***<a id="org7899f7d"></a>:*** A palm-sized computing device that can unfold into a
    thin slab roughly onethird of a meter on a side. It can perform all
    the functions of a compad or handheld computer and can communicate
    wirelessly with nearby devices.

-   ***<a id="org8769fe2"></a>:*** These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in
    thickness, with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually
    anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will
    shift color to blend with its surroundings. One or more line shunts
    must be applied at specific locations within a site to access the
    more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ
    phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not need to be directly
    in contact with a data line but only within a few centimeters. Line
    shunts are single-use, and keep functioning until removed.

-   ***<a id="orge2eea9d"></a>:*** These data broadcast link units have been
    preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth
    circuitry, and sophisticated data progression algorithms. Two of
    these links can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote data
    storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to allow for easy
    hacking, however, and it applies a -2 penalty to any attempts to
    hack through it. Professional-grade security systems often have
    means to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit.

-   ***<a id="org14fe7bf"></a>:*** These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion
    charges were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily
    overcome primitive colonial data security measures. Each charge is a
    small interface plug the size of a human thumb. When used as part of
    a hack against a TL4 system, it causes the skill check to
    automatically succeed regardless of the difficulty. Without line
    shunts, however, the duration of the hack is still no more than the
    usual 1d4 rounds plus the hacker's Program skill. These devices are
    single-use, and are prized so highly that they are almost always
    unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the right people
    and the looting of Mandate remnants are the only normal ways to
    acquire these devices.

-   ***<a id="org3de88af"></a>:*** While conventional dataslabs have ample space to
    hold any reasonable amount of data, sometimes a party needs to store
    or acquire a truly huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a
    portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of
    intentional damage with a firearm, capable of interfacing with a
    wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single
    storage unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that has been
    carefully compressed and optimized for it. If the user is simply
    ripping a database off a network and stuffing it into the unit, it
    can absorb up to a small corporation's complete files.

-   ***<a id="orgaa9ef6c"></a>:*** Much like a remote link unit, a tightbeam
    unit uses a laser to connect via line-of-sight transmission. Unlike
    a remote link unit, there's almost no chance for a conventional
    security system to detect this link, but it requires that the
    infiltrators get a clear line of sight between the unit and the
    receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed
    for skyward aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is
    unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.


<a id="sidebar-foreign-protocols"></a>

## Foreign Protocols

Most surviving human worlds continue to use a basic Mandate-derived
communications protocol that ensures a minimal level of compatibility
between hardware from different worlds. While the performance may not
be ideal, tech purchased on one world should still be able to
interface with the local tech on a different planet.

Even so, a few worlds of a more xenophobic or isolated nature
intentionally abandon this standard protocol in favor of their own. PC
hardware on these worlds will not communicate with the local grid
unless a PC with Program or Fix skills has a chance to reset the
protocols to something compatible with local conditions. Such work
usually takes at least a day to adjust all the gear the group might
possess.


<a id="pharmaceuticals"></a>

## Pharmaceuticals

Modern pharmaceuticals are usually applied as “stims”; small capsules
that are pressed against the target's skin for application. While a
wide variety of common over-the-counter stims are available, the ones
listed below are some particularly likely to be useful to
adventurers. Many medical stims require a minimum level in the Heal
skill to successfully apply them, while others add System Strain to
the target as described here. If a subject's System Strain is too high
already, the stim has no positive effect. Some of the combat stims
below are usually illegal for civilian possession, but street sources
are available at the prices given.

Modern vacc suits and powered armor have medical ports that allow for
applying stims and other medical treatment without removing the suit.

-   ***<a id="org744a591"></a> (Heal-1):*** A complex antibiotic cocktail, Bezoar is an
    effective default treatment for a wide variety of infectious
    diseases. When applied to a sufferer, roll 1d6; on a 1, this victim
    cannot be helped by Bezoar, while otherwise the affliction is cured
    within 24 hours. Each application of Bezoar adds 1 System Strain to
    the target, and it cannot cure cancers, bioweapons, or congenital
    diseases.

-   ***<a id="org503654d"></a> (Heal-2):*** This psitech drug requires advanced TL5
    facilities to compound, and the few remaining doses from pre-Silence
    periods are rarely available on the open market. Application of
    Brainwave gives a psychic 2 extra maximum Effort for one hour. At
    the end of that hour, they suffer 4 points of System Strain. If
    their Strain is maximized by this, they go unconscious for one
    hour. Only one dose can be active at a time.

-   ***<a id="org547fe77"></a> (Heal-0):*** An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer, Hush leaves
    the subject awake and responsive to simple, untaxing commands. They
    cannot fight or communicate while affected by Hush, but will walk,
    eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person
    to speak to them. A Hush dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal
    level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no
    memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or
    willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement
    immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects.

-   ***<a id="org35b0619"></a> (Heal-0):*** A Lift stim augments and amplifies the body's
    natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost
    speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user's
    Heal skill in hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do
    not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they need to be stabilized
    before the Lift can help them, though application to a stabilized
    target will get them back on their feet and active again. Each
    application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each additional
    application of Lift to a target the same day increases the minimum
    Heal skill needed by 1.

-   ***<a id="orgea8e473"></a> (None):*** Before the Silence stims existed for a
    host of cosmetic, hygiene, and health purposes. While these effects
    are trivial, the basic pretech stim substrate also works to heal 1d6
    lost hit points in the user at a cost of 1 System Strain.

-   ***<a id="org49908f8"></a> (None):*** A military drug duplicated in rougher form by many
    street chemists, Psych fills the user with an intense sense of
    confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples
    their judgment regarding danger. A person affected by Psych
    immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and a +1 bonus on all skill
    checks, but will ignore cover during combat and cannot decide not to
    attempt a skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect
    lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the user, and is
    highly psychologically addictive.

-   ***<a id="org1f37eaa"></a> (Heal-1):*** This very dangerous combat drug completely
    subdues the subject's fear centers and adrenaline production,
    leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal
    danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a consequence, and
    they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second,
    fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they suffer is
    doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm
    allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they
    can make Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit
    rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and
    11 at long ranges for the weapon. The target's Armor Class is
    ignored. Melee attacks made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts
    for ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target.

-   ***<a id="org801e1e4"></a> (Heal-1):*** This “truth serum” is unreliable but still one
    of the best available options for field interrogations. The subject
    must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five
    minutes afterwards they will be unable to avoid answering questions
    about facts known to them; they will be unable to exercise anything
    resembling a hypothesis or a judgment, but they will answer specific
    questions about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling victims
    can attempt a Physical saving throw; on a success, they can simply
    refuse to speak about one particular topic of their choice. Targets
    pass out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are immune to it
    for a week thereafter.

-   ***<a id="orgb6d5620"></a> (Heal-1):*** An emergency combat stim used to juice certain
    expendable soldiers before an assault, Tsunami fills them with a
    reckless disregard for pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short
    effect duration and difficult application limits its wider use,
    however. Subjects gain a Morale score of 12, 10 extra hit points for
    ten minutes and a +2 bonus on all hit rolls. At the end of the
    duration, they immediately lose those 10 hit points, which may leave
    them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to the
    target.


<a id="tools-and-medical-gear"></a>

### Tools and Medical Gear

While a skilled technician or expert physician can make do with
improvised tools scrounged from their surroundings, most adventurers
prefer to be better-equipped to face unavoidable perils. Most of these
tools and medical supplies are available on any TL4 world, though
pretech toolkits usually require excellent personal contacts to
obtain.

-   ***<a id="org5b29095"></a>:*** While an untrained user can use this tool to discern
    internal bleeding, gross physical distress, or toxins in a plant or
    animal, it requires Heal-0 skill to use this tool to its
    fullest. Such operators can use the bioscanner for a full spectrum
    of diagnosis and DNA sequencing achievable in minutes. One type A
    power cell will power it for up to twenty-four hours of regular
    usage.

-   ***<a id="org2ce6bfc"></a>:*** A vital tool for adventurers, the lazarus patch
    is a heavy compress laced with antibiotics, coagulants, system
    stabilizers, plasma, and a one-shot diagnostic suite. If the patch
    is applied to a character that has fallen to 0 hit points, the user
    can make an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check against difficulty 6 to
    stabilize the subject. The more time between injury and application,
    the less chance the patch has to work. Each round after the first,
    an additional -1 penalty is applied to the skill check. The patch is
    no use after six rounds. If the medic fails the first skill check,
    they can keep trying the check once per round until the victim is
    revived or time runs out.

    Lazarus patches are no use on victims that have died of disease,
    poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy weapons
    or similar trauma. Only one patch can be applied to a
    victim. Revived victims are critically wounded until sufficient
    medical help has been tendered; see the Systems chapter for details.

-   ***<a id="org7d01d26"></a>:*** Containing a broad supply of pharmaceuticals, spray
    bandages, glue sutures, and a succinct handbook of injury care, the
    medkit is designed for handling sudden and drastic injuries. It also
    contains all the necessary tools for providing long-term
    recuperative care for critically injured characters. After each day
    of granting long-term recuperative care, roll 2d6 per patient
    treated; on a 12, the kit has run out of some vital pharmaceutical
    and has become useless.

-   ***<a id="org6af2e6d"></a>:*** This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small,
    useful tools designed to handle the widest possible range of
    technical needs. While a metatool is too limited to handle major
    jobs, it is usually sufficient to manage jury-rigged repairs and
    temporary fixes until the tech has time to apply a larger wrench to
    the problem.

-   ***<a id="orga6d940b"></a>:*** This is a general category for a number of small
    TL4 components and repair materials. While a simple toolkit or
    metatool is often enough to fix a damaged object, severely broken
    devices may need replacement parts. Rather than keep a catalog of
    bits and pieces, a technician can simply bring along one or more
    units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM decides that a
    repair effort requires more than existing salvage can support. A
    unit of spare parts can also be used to jury-rig some basic,
    uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or
    fifteen minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such bodged
    devices rarely last longer than one scene.

-   ***<a id="orgd66c0de"></a>:*** A dose of tailored antiallergens can be
    used to render a local world's organics largely edible by humans and
    its atmosphere breathable without severe allergic reactions. While
    many worlds have been seeded with Terran life forms or have produced
    organics that are edible by humans, others are toxic without the
    appropriate chemical augmentation. A dose of these antiallergens
    lasts for twenty-four hours.

-   ***<a id="org3f78e90"></a>:*** Containing a wide range of necessary tools for a
    particular skill set, toolkits can handle almost any job that
    doesn't require a full-scale shop or lab. A standard postech toolkit
    can handle electronics, small welding jobs, and basic repair on
    ordinary TL4 goods. More sophisticated pretech tools are necessary
    for working on advanced TL5 artifacts, and the tools themselves are
    very rare and difficult to obtain.


<a id="sidebar-building-new-tech"></a>

## Building New Tech

In a science-fiction game, it's often difficult to figure out the
limits of ad-hoc tech. When the limits of technology often seem to be
based on genre rather than physics it can be tough to make the call.

Most of the time, it's simply not practical for a technician to devise
dramatic new tech without the use of a full-scale research facility.

Even so, sometimes a PC will ask to build something that creates a
particular effect that seems in line with other gear of a similar tech
level. A hologram-emitting “grenade”, a jury-rigged set of infrared
goggles, an explosive that detonates if background radiation drops
below a certain level&#x2026; these things match known TL4 tech.

In these cases, the GM should set a plausible-seeming price in credits
or spare part units, assign a time ranging from fifteen minutes to a
month based on the complexity of the tech, and roll a secret Int/Fix
check against a difficulty from 8 to 12. When the tech is actually
used, the skill check determines whether it functions or not.

Most such jury-rigged tech works only once, being too fragile or
quirky to last more than a scene. Repeated refinement and testing may
allow for a more lasting piece of equipment.

## Field Equipment

When venturing into the trackless void every adventurer is going to
need the right hardware to survive the experience. The field equipment
in this section includes some of the more common technology favored by
explorers and fearless investigators of alien worlds. The TL5
equipment listed here can usually be found for sale on populous worlds
with an active commerce in pretech relics, but smaller or more
backwards worlds may not have any of it available.

-   ***<a id="org289d90c"></a>:*** This face mask can filter out most atmospheric
    toxins. Attaching a standard vacc suit oxygen bottle to a
    belt-mounted feed will also supply a breathable atmosphere for up to
    six hours.

-   ***<a id="org5fc770d"></a>:*** TL4 versions of this item are effectively without
    encumbrance, albeit they cost 50 credits. A worn backpack counts as
    a readied item, though objects stowed inside it still require the
    usual round to dig free. Characters without backpacks or similar
    carrying devices might have difficulty justifying the hauling of
    large amounts of gear.

-   ***<a id="orgb2a7999"></a>:*** Standard 7x50 binoculars. TL4 versions are available
    that have integral low-light optics and up to 25x150 power. TL 4
    binocs cost 200 credits and require a type A power cell for up to a
    week of regular usage.

-   ***<a id="org0ae772e"></a>:*** A collection of straps, ropes, pitons, and
    other climbing aids that grant a +1 bonus on any Exert climbing
    skill test. Using a climbing harness is noisy, and any Sneak skill
    checks while climbing with one suffer a -2 penalty.

-   ***<a id="orgb79ca16"></a>:*** A palm-sized disc that can adhere to any non-porous
    surface. When turned on, it emits a white light, illuminating
    everything within ten meters for twenty-four hours. A hundred
    glowbugs can be recharged off a single type A cell.

-   ***<a id="org3248334"></a>:*** This launcher fires a rope up to forty
    meters. The rope can bear up to a metric ton of weight, though
    extremely heavy weights or a precarious hit can cause the grapnel to
    pull free. A Type A power cell fuels six shots from a launcher.

-   ***<a id="org6052845"></a>:*** When this cylinder is strapped to a person or object
    and activated, it smoothly modulates falling speeds for up to 1000
    meters. The chute can safely slow up to 300 kilos of weight. TL5
    versions can operate from orbital heights and cost 1,000 credits,
    where they can be found at all. Both versions burn out after one
    use.

-   ***<a id="org61e4bfc"></a>:*** This advanced gravitic harness allows clumsy
    flight at a rate of 20 meters per round as a Main Action. It
    requires a Type B power cell to fuel it, and the miniaturized
    electronics are rapacious, consuming the cell in five minutes of
    operation. It can lift up to 200 kilos.

-   ***<a id="org71cb5e7"></a>:*** In its compressed form, an instapanel is a two-kilo
    cube of ceraplast five centimeters on a side. When a type A power
    cell is inserted in the cube's side, it immediately expands to an
    opaque, waterproof ceraplast sheet 2 meters on each side and a
    centimeter thick. Five minutes later the ceraplast hardens into a
    tough, rigid shape, but until then it can be folded or bent by
    hand. Instapanels can be bonded to one another with a metatool or a
    toolkit. Breaking an instapanel requires inflicting at least twelve
    points of damage on it.

-   ***<a id="orgeac3b4b"></a>:*** These goggles provide a monochrome but
    serviceable view out to the wearer's normal visual distance,
    provided that there is any illumination available at all. A type A
    power cell will operate these goggles for a week.

-   ***<a id="org0c2d7b9"></a>:*** A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers,
    astronomic charts, and gyroscopes packed into a flat, one-kilo
    case. A character with a navcomp will never get lost on worlds with
    GPS satellites. They can also make a crude but serviceable automatic
    map of all buildings or landscapes they travel through. Other
    terrestrial navigation skill checks are made at a +1 bonus.

-   ***<a id="org9a80b8e"></a>:*** A small cube of ceraplast attached to an electronic
    keycard. When a type A power cell is inserted, the portabox
    immediately unfolds into a rigid locker with 1.5 x 1 x 1 meter
    dimensions. The portabox is air-tight and has a simple electronic
    lock which can only be opened with the keycard or a successful
    difficulty 8 Sneak or Fix skill check. Failing the check will cause
    the lock to short-circuit and seal the box until it can be cut open
    with a metatool or broken open with twenty points of damage.

-   ***<a id="orgebbe24b"></a>:*** This tent maintains a breathable atmosphere,
    tolerable temperature and serviceable sleeping quarters for up to
    five very friendly occupants. Advanced filtration and cracking tech
    allows a single standard vacc suit oxygen tank to provide breathable
    air for the occupants for up to 24 hours. The tent requires a type A
    power cell for each day in which this filter is employed.

-   ***<a id="orgae05125"></a>:*** Dried or otherwise preserved foodstuffs sufficient for
    one day. If water is not otherwise available, add another item's
    worth of encumbrance for the water necessary for a person's daily
    needs.

-   ***<a id="orge1a3a40"></a>:*** Light and sturdy. A metatool can be used to cut and join
    the synthetics used in TL4 rope, which counts as one encumbrance
    item per 40 meters and costs 40 credits.

-   ***<a id="org17b9f81"></a>:*** A collation of survey scans and merchant reports
    on a particular lost world or isolated colony. Scouting reports are
    available for all but the most unknown worlds and provide maps,
    basic information, and note any critical cultural taboos.

-   ***<a id="orgedd4943"></a>:*** A multipurpose scanner that can take atmospheric
    and gravitic readings, provide basic chemical analysis of samples of
    up to one cubic centimeter in size, and record up to two hundred
    hours of video information or ten times that amount of audio. Know
    skill checks are necessary for any but the most basic analysis.

-   ***<a id="org7ca25b1"></a>:*** A standard belt-worn kit with fire lighter, water
    filter, three thermal flares, knife, thermal blanket, a
    brightly-colored 3 x 3 meter waterproof tarp, a glowbug, and a radio
    beacon that can transmit a distress signal up to fifty kilometers
    for one month on the included type A power cell. Survival kits sold
    on a particular world will usually also include a small booklet on
    specific dangers or edible organics. Possession of a survival kit
    grants a +1 to all relevant Survive skill checks, assuming its
    contents are helpful on a given planet. Survival kits are
    well-organized, and count as only one item for encumbrance purposes.

-   ***<a id="org0b408f4"></a>:*** Retracting to a 30-centimeter baton, this pole
    extends and locks into a 3.048-meter extension that can bear as much
    as a thousand kilograms of weight or serve as a makeshift club.

-   ***<a id="org81575b1"></a>:*** If triggered in one mode, the flare burns with a
    bright white light for two hours, illuminating up to twenty meters
    around the holder. If the guidance fins are extended first, the
    flare launches up to 200 meters and explodes in a bright white
    flash. A launched flare does 1d6 damage to anyone it hits, though
    the clumsy flight gives a -4 penalty on any attempts to hit
    something with it.

-   ***<a id="org9812154"></a>:*** Glowbugs, ceramic fire lighters, antibiotics,
    ceraplast tools, and the other fruits of a TL4 civilization that
    might be valuable on more primitive worlds. A kilo of trade goods
    can usually be traded for at least a hundred credits worth of local
    products on more primitive worlds that are not well-served by
    interstellar merchants. The profit margin shrinks rapidly as
    interstellar trade becomes more common, and there is always the
    difficulty of finding local products that are actually worth a
    merchant's journey.

-   ***<a id="org2dad883"></a>:*** The fruit of common TL4 asteroid mining, trade
    metals include gold, platinum, artificial gemstones, and other
    substances precious on many lost worlds and trivially valuable on
    spacefaring ones. A kilo worth of trade metals can be exchanged for
    as much as a thousand credits worth of local products on metal-poor
    worlds isolated from interstellar trade. Markets flood rapidly,
    however, and it usually doesn't take more than a few merchant trips
    to persuade the locals to demand trade goods or credits.

## Local Brands

The equipment described in this section matches standard TL4 hardware
from the average modern space-faring world. A PC who buys a generic
vacc suit can expect it to work the way it's listed here.

Not all worlds have identical tech, however, even if they share a tech
level. Planets with particular natural hazards or technological
focuses often have significantly better tech for dealing with these
things than their neighbors, while worlds that lack vital resources or
industrial infrastructure might have considerably worse gear.

As the GM, don't hesitate to brew up local tech that can be used as a
reward for PCs or a special buying opportunity. The gear might grant
skill bonuses, function longer, do more damage, have an AC bonus, or
offer some other perk. Such unique hardware can add flavor to a
world's tech.

-   ***<a id="org5a9ebae"></a>:*** This three-kilo tube filters and compresses
    atmosphere to refill vacc suit oxygen tanks. It can extract oxygen
    from any atmosphere which contains it, even in the form of carbon
    dioxide. Refilling a standard vacc suit tank requires ten minutes of
    operation and consumes one type A power cell. Most vacc freshers are
    also equipped with an emergency hand crank power source, though it
    requires at least two hours of cranking.

-   ***<a id="org31915b6"></a>:*** The standard TL4 vacc suit is designed to allow the
    wearer to survive in both hard vacuum and on most inhospitable
    planetary surfaces. The suit protects against ordinary levels of
    cosmic radiation and provides a temperature-controlled
    atmosphere. Vacc suits are equipped with radios that have a
    ten-kilometer range. A vacc suit oxygen tank weighs 1 encumbrance,
    included with the weight of the suit, and functions for six hours.

    Vacc suits are cumbersome, and apply a -2 penalty to all hit rolls
    and skill checks that require movement. Those with at least a month
    of zero-gee experience can ignore this penalty. No armor can be worn
    with a vacc suit, though the suit itself grants AC 13 to its
    wearers. A vacc suit requires one type A power cell for each twelve
    hours of operation.

    Vacc suits have a self-healing exterior that can seal the puncture
    wounds caused by bullets, arrows, or energy beams, but a strike from
    an edged weapon can overwhelm the repair system. If a character with
    10 or fewer hit points is struck by an edged weapon, there is a 50%
    chance the suit is torn. Suits are equipped with emergency repair
    patches, but it requires a Main Action to apply one. Exposure to
    vacuum is described here.

-   ***<a id="orga98a0e6"></a>:*** A more advanced TL5 version of the vacc suit, this
    skin-tight suit can be worn as a readied item in conjunction with
    armor, though it grants no Armor Class bonus itself. It requires no
    oxygen tank, automatically cracking and recycling the wearer's
    respiration, and can even recycle the wearer's bodily waste into
    drinkable water if necessary. Vacc skins apply no penalty to hit
    rolls or skill checks for wearers. It suffers tears in the same way
    as a normal vacc suit, and requires a type A power cell for each 24
    hours of operation.

## Lifestyles, Employees, and Services

Adventurers who spend much time in a place are likely to need to buy
food, shelter, and the usual trifles of daily living. Rather than
itemize each expense, a PC can simply spend an fixed amount for each
day they spend living outside of a ship's crew, barracks, or other
arranged living situation.

-   ***Slum*** lifestyles reflect bare minimums for survival, with scanty
    food, a corner in a squat somewhere, and little else.

-   ***Poor*** lifestyles involve barracks-like quarters, public
    transport, and small and infrequent luxuries.

-   ***Common*** lifestyles usually allow for a private urban apartment or
    rural home, a rented personal vehicle, a respectable wardrobe, and
    regular small indulgences.

-   ***Good*** lifestyles permit a private urban townhouse or similar
    dwelling, a spacious rural home, a better grade of personal vehicle,
    and the ability to indulge in minor expenses such as restaurants or
    clubs without concern.

-   ***Elite*** lifestyles allow for entire floors of luxury buildings or
    rented rural estates, drivers and on-call gravflyers, personal
    staff, and similar perks.

-   ***Peerless*** lifestyles are similar to that of pampered celebrities
    and oligarchs, with round-the-clock staff service, free entrance
    into the most exclusive locales, and the best of everything.

Prices given here assume short-term rentals and contracts, plus the
inevitable premium charged to outsiders in almost any society. Natives
might be able to enjoy a given level of lifestyle for only half as
much, but such savings usually rely on a local's connections.

PCs will sometimes need to hire help, and GMs occasionally need to
know what constitutes a “good wage” for a local NPC. The prices to the
right reflect daily wages for NPCs with level-0, level-1, and level-2
skill ratings in their relevant professional skills. More talented
employees cannot normally be obtained without special effort in
finding and recruiting them.

Psychics are both rare and expensive to hire. Even if one can be
found, they rarely charge less than 200 credits per day per psychic
skill level to be employed.

Employees will carry out ordinary duties without demur, but will be no
braver or more dedicated than their pay and connections would make
them.

Adventurers often need to obtain certain services or concessions from
the locals, and the list to the right provides prices for some of
their more common needs.

Bribe prices often vary depending on a planet's general level of
corruption, but the prices here are normal for most. Minor crimes
usually involve anything that would only earn a fine or a few months
in jail. Major crimes include most felonies and anything that would
earn years in prison. Capital crimes are any that would get a culprit
executed on the world. Particularly blatant or sensitive offenses
might be impossible to solve with mere bribery, though the right
“special favors” to the right officials might win a reprieve.

Forged identity papers include high-quality documentation with the
appropriate false database entries. They're good enough to survive
checkpoints and security stops, but they won't hold up to a serious
check by a suspicious bureaucrat.

<a id="vehicles"></a>

### Vehicles

Most modern TL4 worlds rely on electrically-powered gravitic
vehicles. Whether in the ubiquitous gravcar, hovercycle, or
high-altitude gravflyer, cleared roadways carry the traffic of
countless worlds. On rougher worlds, the roads may not even be paved,
instead relying on a gravitic vehicle's high clearance to avoid holes
and rough debris.

Less sophisticated worlds are still reliant on internal-combustion
engines. Many worlds have sufficient local resources to fabricate some
kind of combustible fuel, but a few are so impoverished that they lack
even this minimal resource. Such worlds must rely on muscle power for
transport, either that of alien beasts or humble human porters.


<a id="vehicle-statistics-and-combat"></a>

### Vehicle Statistics and Combat

Vehicles are generally powered by type B power cells on TL4 worlds.
More primitive planets are usually forced to use some form of biofuel
unless they're fortunate enough to have a supply of fossil fuels.
Vehicles require one cell or one refueling per six hours of operation,
assuming they don't have convenient power access.

Vehicles are generally limited to reasonably flat, dry terrain. Grav
vehicles such as hovercycles can ignore rough terrain and calm water,
as can ATV explorers. Most grav vehicles can boost more than 10 meters
above the ground or water; gravflyers are purpose-designed aircraft
capable of hovering and VTOL.

-   ***Speed*** is an abstract measure of the vehicle's speed and
    agility. When vehicles chase each other, the opposing vehicle's
    Speed should be applied as a penalty to Pilot skill checks to close
    or escape. Speed may also be used as a modifier when attempting
    difficult maneuvers or trying to avoid a peril on the road.

-   ***Armor*** is subtracted from all weapon damage done to the
    vehicle. Armor does not apply to damage done by Heavy weaponry; such
    guns are often designed to take out vehicles. Gravtanks in
    particular are immune to anything short of TL4 Heavy weapons, while
    less sophisticated tanks are immune to anything below TL3 Heavy
    ordnance.

    Actually hitting the vehicle is automatic if the vehicle is
    stationary and within 30 feet. Hitting a vehicle-sized target from
    beyond that range requires an attack against AC 10. If the target is
    moving, subtract its Speed from the hit roll, and if the attacker is
    in a moving vehicle as well, also subtract their Speed.

-   ***Hit Points*** indicate the amount of damage a vehicle can take
    before it is destroyed. Speed is reduced by half when the vehicle is
    at half hit points, and flying vehicles must land at the first
    opportunity. A vehicle reduced to zero hit points forces all crew
    and passengers to make Physical saving throws. Failure means that
    the passenger takes the vehicle's maximum hit points in damage,
    while success reduces the damage by half.

-   ***Crew*** gives the maximum number of vehicle occupants. For the
    listed vehicles, only one crew member is actually necessary to drive
    or pilot the vehicle, though additional crew members may be required
    to fire.

-   ***Tonnage*** is the shipping weight of the vehicle for ship loading
    purposes.

-   ***Tech Level*** indicates the minimum tech level for constructing the
    vehicle. Vehicles can be built at higher tech levels for better
    performance, but most worlds prefer to simply build more advanced
    vehicles.


<a id="vehicle-weaponry"></a>

### Vehicle Weaponry

Most vehicles larger than a motorcycle or hovercycle can mount some
kind of integral weapon. Groundcars and gravcars can mount one weapon,
while ATVs, helicopters, atmoflyers, and gravflyers can mount two.
Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms, and can mount six.

    Heavy weapons take up more space than ordinary ranged weapons, and
    each such system takes up the space of two lesser guns.

    Every weapon requires its own gunner, and all mounted weapons use
    Shoot as the firing skill, though the GM might allow Pilot to be used
    for a nose-mounted weapon aimed by the operator. Gravtanks are
    equipped with advanced targeting systems, and all of their weapons can
    be targeted and fired by one gunner.


<a id="types-of-vehicles"></a>

### Types of Vehicles

Every world has its own brands of common vehicles, but the types below
cover the more usual models. The prices given for each reflect a
mid-range new vehicle sold to a PC with few local contacts. Natives
who know the right people or are willing to buy used or “quirky”
vehicles might be able to get one at half that price.

-   ***<a id="orgfc2c308"></a>*** can navigate urban terrain that would block larger
    vehicles, but more rural landscapes can prove more difficult.

-   ***<a id="org672b7c9"></a>*** are the TL4 equivalent, capable of brief boosts of
    up to 10 meters above the ground and the easy navigation of all but
    thick forests or sheer slopes.

-   ***<a id="org1c3e9e8"></a>*** are the TL3 analogs of the vehicles commonly in use
    on 21st-century Earth, allowing for some minor variations in
    electronics and capabilities. Primitive buggies of various kinds are
    found even on higher-tech worlds, thanks to their ease of
    construction and maintenance compared to the delicate gravitics of
    more modern vehicles.

-   ***<a id="org1871a39"></a>*** are the standard personal vehicles of most TL4 worlds,
    though most lower-class citizens rely on public transport in urban
    areas. Most advanced worlds have planetary transit grids that allow
    occupants to simply code in a destination and let the car take them
    there. On worlds where a lack of infrastructure or hostile local
    conditions preclude such convenience, manual controls and Pilot
    skill can be used.

-   ***<a id="org8c7e159"></a>*** are rugged vehicles, either wheeled or tracked,
    and driven by type B power cells or locally-available
    biofuels. While they can't navigate rough terrain as easily as a
    grav vehicle, they're designed to take a tremendous amount of
    punishment before breaking down and support repairs using basic
    tools and frontier expedients.

-   ***<a id="orgb981d34"></a>*** are used on TL3 worlds where a lack of airfields or
    treacherous local terrain prohibits the use of fixed-wing
    craft. Their ability to hover over an area or drop onto a
    tightly-constrained landing zone makes them particular favorites of
    quick-response military forces and groups in need of fast fire
    support. This model represents a medium-weight civilian craft that
    might be repurposed by militia or adventurers.

-   ***<a id="org425b14a"></a>*** are the fixed-wing aircraft used on planets too
    primitive to have developed gravitic technology. Faster and simpler
    to maintain than comparable helicopters, they can also carry more
    cargo on most worlds. The need for clear, hard terrain for landing
    and take-off limit their use on some rugged worlds. The model here
    is meant to represent a small personal jet.

-   ***<a id="org59f54ca"></a>*** are the usual long-distance transport on most TL4
    worlds. Large enough to support the gravitics required for true
    flight, a few models can even reach low orbit. All can hover and
    climb with typical gravitic ease. This particular gravflyer is a
    small craft suitable for a affluent owner and their family.

-   ***<a id="orgfb840a3"></a>*** make up the bulk of a prosperous TL4 world's armored
    forces. Private ownership is strictly forbidden on most worlds, but
    “export models” often can be acquired for transport
    offworld. Gravtanks have armor heavy enough to ignore all damage
    from conventional small arms, and can only be harmed by Heavy
    weapons or properly-placed demolitions charges.


<a id="drones"></a>

### Drones

In the far future, it's often more convenient to send an expendable
grav-flying probe into danger before venturing less repairable assets.
Well-prepared adventuring groups often have reason to pack along a
drone or two for exploring and aerial recon.

Military use of drones is limited by the ubiquitous use of quantum
ECM. The easy confusion of electronic navigation makes it impossible
to control an unwired drone remotely on a modern battlefield or in
proximity to important civil structures, but in the alien wilds or
away from urban centers, drones remain a feasible tool for explorers
and conquerors of primitive militaries.


<a id="piloting-a-drone"></a>

### Piloting a Drone

Piloting a drone requires either a cybernetic drone control link as
described here or a handheld control unit that comes with the drone. A
control link can pilot up to one drone plus the user's Program skill
at any one time. Handheld units can pilot only one. Drones consume one
type A power cell for every hour of use.

A pilot must spend their Main Action each round to command the drone
to either move or shoot. Uncommanded drones remain stationary if
piloted via control link, while handheld units run a 2-in-6 chance of
crashing a drone if the operator fails to control them.

In combat, drones fly at 30 meters per round on their pilot's turn in
combat. Out of combat, they can manage up to 100 kilometers per hour.

Spotting a drone at observation range is a Wis/Notice skill check at
difficulty 10. A drone close enough to engage a target can be spotted
at difficulty 8. Any secure facility will have sensors capable of
detecting a civilian drone as soon as it gets within observation
range, unless the drone has stealth fittings.


<a id="drone-combat"></a>

### Drone Combat

A drone's pilot can activate up to one weapon the drone is carrying as
part of their Main Action to control it each round. Weapons all use
Intelligence as the controlling attribute, and use the better of the
pilot's Pilot or Program skills as the relevant weapon skill. The
drone shoots using the pilot's base attack bonus.


<a id="drone-types-and-statistics"></a>

### Drone Types and Statistics

Each drone has a cost, a maximum number of fittings, an Encumbrance
weight for carrying it along, a hit point rating, a maximum control
range, and a minimum tech level. Drones may be attacked as any other
object and will crash once reduced to zero hit points.

-   ***<a id="orgc2a2449"></a>*** represent the best flying portable drone
    technology for TL3 worlds. While fragile, weak, and short-ranged,
    they are also relatively cheap.

-   ***<a id="org49044ef"></a>*** are unique in being built specifically for deep-space
    use. Unlike other drones, they can operate perfectly well in space,
    though they only have the range to reach relatively adjacent ships
    or objects.

-   ***<a id="orgbc18d41"></a>*** drones are the default TL4 workhorses of drone-kind and
    are available on most modern worlds.

-   ***<a id="org6cf41e4"></a>*** are specifically designed for aqueous use, and
    function only in a liquid medium. The support of the liquid allows
    them to carry significantly more fittings, but the need for a
    sonar-based navigation system limits their available range.

-   ***<a id="org796e300"></a>*** are stealth drones, fabricated from
    radar-transparent materials. They have an integral *Sensor
    Transparency* fitting and the sensor difficulty to spot them is 11
    instead of 9.

-   ***<a id="org47d1948"></a>*** drones are built to tarry on station for long
    periods. They have the *Stationkeeping* fitting as an integral part
    of their design, and when hovering their power use slows to a
    trickle. One day of hovering draws only five minutes worth of power
    from its cell.

-   ***<a id="org4d13488"></a>*** drones are some of the most common pretech drones remaining
    in existence, as they were favored by the Mandate Fleet for
    pacifying troublesome worlds that lacked quantum ECM. While
    primitive by pretech standards, they still far excel most modern
    drones.

-   ***<a id="org1ecc6e6"></a>*** model of drone exemplifies one way that pretech
    scientists attempted to sidestep the limits of quantum ECM on the
    modern battlefield. Every Alecto is a full-fledged VI, an expert
    system so sophisticated as to seem almost sentient. Its
    self-reinforcing cognition allows it to operate even when cut off
    from external signals by quantum ECM. Salvaged Alectos have all
    exhibited “female” personalities.


<a id="drone-fittings-and-repair"></a>

### Drone Fittings and Repair

Aside from the basic drone chassis, operators can attach different
fittings to a drone to add additional capabilities. Once attached, a
fitting cannot be removed without causing severe structural damage to
the drone. If a drone is destroyed, all fittings are destroyed with
it.

If a drone is damaged, it can be repaired fully with one unit of spare
parts per five hit points lost and an hour's work by someone with at
least Fix-0 skill.

-   ***<a id="orgb5406da"></a>:*** The drone carries one power cell or magazine worth of
    ammunition for each of its onboard weapons, whether single or
    multiple. The operator can reload an ammo unit as a Main Action.

-   ***<a id="org5d4bc5c"></a>:*** The drone is fitted to drop up to two grenade-sized
    explosives, one or both in lieu of a different weapon
    attack. Dropping a grenade from more than 30 meters up automatically
    causes the grenade to scatter from its intended target point.

-   ***<a id="org0bea5f2"></a>:*** The drone draws operating power from
    sunlight or thermal variances. It can operate indefinitely so long
    as it can draw power from its environment.

-   ***<a id="org71638c8"></a>:*** The drone is loaded with sophisticated
    self-piloting software. It can be given a flight plan by its
    operator, have targets designated for its weapon, and respond to
    simple environmental cues. Each new command takes up a Main Action
    and commands with any conditional states may require an Int/ Program
    skill check to get the drone to understand. The drone can fire only
    one weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of +2 if
    attacking autonomously. Quantum ECM will scramble this lightweight
    system.

-   ***<a id="org587fd4c"></a>:*** The drone can now carry a second type A cell to
    fuel its flight. This fitting can be taken multiple times to further
    extend its range.

-   ***<a id="org3fa881a"></a>:*** The drone is made exceptionally quiet in
    operation. It is now inaudible by ordinary hearing from more than
    five meters away.

-   ***<a id="orgae7a2ae"></a>:*** While most drones can lift no more than a kilogram
    of excess weight, the drone's gravitic units have been upgraded to
    carry up to twenty kilos of cargo. This can be fitted multiple
    times.

-   ***<a id="org5f26f1a"></a>:*** The drone can drop a filmy hologram over itself, one
    convincing at a distance. The difficulty of visually spotting the
    drone becomes 10 at weapons range or 12 at observational
    range. Weapons fire always draws attention.

-   ***<a id="org84618d1"></a>:*** The drone can be loaded with up to a dozen
    units of medication, whether stim doses, lazarus patches, or less
    benevolent substances. It can launch a medication through a remote
    injector at a target within ten meters in lieu of a weapon
    attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while
    hostiles require a normal hit roll. The drone is treated as having
    Heal-0 skill or the active pilot's Heal skill, whichever is higher.

-   ***<a id="org15ffd7b"></a>:*** All drones are wired for basic camera and
    sound, but this suite contains a full-spectrum UV/IR visual package,
    remote sound sensors, and radiation/chemical detectors. The drone
    can focus on conversations or facial expressions from up to 2
    kilometers away and can operate even in the complete absence of
    visible light.

-   ***<a id="org388a778"></a>:*** The drone is tuned for extra speed. Its flight
    endurance is halved, but it can now move up to 60 meters per combat
    round and fly at up to 200 kph out of combat.

-   ***<a id="org6a18f1b"></a>:*** The drone is equipped with heavier plating
    and a sturdier internal frame. Its hit points are increased by 50%,
    rounded up.

-   ***<a id="orgc33b11d"></a>:*** The drone is sheathed in anti-radar
    composites. Ordinary sensors will not detect it at observation
    range, and highend military sensors can spot it only on an
    Int/Program check at difficulty 9.

-   ***<a id="orgf81f7ee"></a>:*** The drone does not need to be constantly
    controlled; when the operator does not spend a Main Action to pilot
    it, it simply remains stationary. If equipped with an *Observation
    Suite*, it can ping the operator if any anomalous reading is
    obtained.

-   ***<a id="orge2069fc"></a>:*** The drone is loaded with a demo charge here. The
    operator can trigger it as an attack, but unless they can move the
    drone in by surprise, the approach will always give onlookers a
    chance to spot it before it gets within range.

-   ***<a id="org946c5a3"></a>:*** The drone can be mounted with 1 encumbrance
    worth of ranged weaponry, which must be purchased separately. This
    fitting may be taken more than once to mount more weapons or heavier
    weapons. The weapon requires one or more ammo units to feed it.


<a id="cyberware"></a>

### Cyberware

Postech medical science and neural interface technology are
sophisticated enough to meld metal and flesh into a coherent whole.
The creation of advanced cyberware is not beyond the theoretical
capability of TL4 societies, and pretech worlds can produce cyberware
of such sophistication as to blur the lines between organism and
artifice.

Yet cyberware is rarely available on most worlds, even those with the
nominal technology level to support it. The advantages that cyberware
can give a user are great, but the cost of building, fitting, and
implanting these devices is huge compared to simply buying a handheld
device to do the same function. There are few buyers for a 15,000
credit ghost talker implant when a compad retails for a hundred
credits.

The market that does exist is largely for those few elite operatives
and dignitaries who are willing to pay exorbitant sums for the
smallest advantage. Most cyberware is custom-built for its users, and
it can be an adventure in itself to find a lab capable of
manufacturing an augmentation and successfully implanting it. Some
worlds have industrialized the production of cyberware, however,
making it much cheaper and in much wider circulation. Even then, these
worlds rarely export much cyberware due to the heavy infrastructure
necessary to fit and implant the wares. Those who want the tech will
have to find such planets and do their own negotiations there.

Aside from the difficulties of cost and scarcity, cyberware also taxes
the wearer's body. Each piece of cyberware comes with a System Strain
cost as described here, permanently adding that many points of System
Strain to the user's total. These points can never be lost unless the
system is surgically removed. This permanent System Strain decreases
the amount of psionic healing a character can sustain and can limit
the effectiveness of healing and stimulant drugs.

Some cyberware has an activation cost in System Strain. If a cost
would push the character's System Strain above their Constitution
score, they cannot trigger the cyberware; their body just can't handle
the strain until it has had time to recover.

-   ***<a id="org3ce12b0"></a>:*** These endocrine pumps neutralize
    numerous brain chemicals in the user when activated while exciting
    the user's perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold,
    dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user +2 on
    initiative rolls when the system is engaged. Most systems have
    built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and
    brain damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour
    each day. The user takes a -2 penalty on all social skill checks
    while the unit is active, and it requires five rounds to toggle it.

-   ***<a id="orgfbaffd4"></a>:*** These additional synthetic organs and
    filters allow the bearer to survive in thin-atmosphere conditions,
    as well as tolerate temperatures ranging from Antarctic chill to
    heat sufficient to boil water. They can also eat a wide range of
    native life forms for sustenance; no normal planet’s native biology
    is ever considered immiscible for consumption.

-   ***<a id="org29f631d"></a>:*** Some personnel need to be armed at all times
    without giving any indication of such. Improvised weaponry and
    conventional holdout weapons are useful enough against soft targets,
    but disabling a target in powered armor requires more. The details
    of the array vary from user to user, but usually act as advanced
    medium weapons that can be used with either Punch or Stab skills and
    at least one integral energy projector equal to a laser rifle, one
    that must be powered by an insertable type A power cell. Retracted
    body arsenals can be detected only by a medical examination.

-   ***<a id="org7f8507f"></a>:*** Not so much a single implant as a series of
    complex surgeries, body sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds
    with fairly advanced medical services. After a week of alterations
    and treatments a subject's external appearance can be set within any
    human or near-human range, including full retinal and fingerprint
    matching to a desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment that
    costs ten times as much can involve extensive DNA reprogramming to
    change the subject at a genetic level, making their alterations
    heritable and allowing female-targeted shapes to bear
    offspring. This TL5 treatment is not reversible, and any further
    major alterations to the subject require further permanent System
    Strain.

-   ***<a id="org01e0375"></a>:*** A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides
    significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining
    imperceptible to anything short of a medical examination. Someone
    with the implant has AC 16 and is immune to Shock damage inflicted
    by primitive melee weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs
    five times as much grants even more protection, rendering the
    subject wholly immune to primitive weapons as if they were wearing
    powered armor.

-   ***<a id="org6242c59"></a>:*** Most often found among military bot
    wranglers, civilians can also get a drone control link implanted to
    simplify the remote piloting of drones and other robotic units.

    Users of a link can issue commands to a drone as a Move action
    instead of a Main Action. A single drone can only receive one
    command per round, however.

    Aside from this ease of command, someone with an implanted rig can
    “look” through a piloted drone's sensors as an Instant action, and a
    drone is never considered to be out of control even if the pilot
    doesn't spend an action controlling it. A link can maintain a
    connection with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program skill.

-   ***<a id="org2b035bd"></a>:*** A hair-fine mesh of almost imperceptible
    wiring along the user's palms and fingers allow them to trigger
    brief, controlled bursts of electrical energy at targets within five
    meters. As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal damage to a
    successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it also allows the
    user to override and disable most electronic locks and security
    systems with a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering
    a burst and hacking a security system tax the user's biology; one
    System Strain point is gained with each attack or skill check.

-   ***<a id="orgb34ed72"></a>:*** Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are embedded
    in the subject's hands and feet as part of this complex
    surgery. While they are too weak to allow levitation or damping fall
    damage, they can twist localized gravity around those limbs to
    anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable of bearing their
    weight. As a result, the user can freely run or climb up or down
    sheer surfaces at their normal movement rate, carrying no more than
    their normal maximum encumbrance.

-   ***<a id="orge775148"></a>:*** Some people simply cannot afford to be
    out of contact at any time, under any circumstances. Those people
    find use for the microfine web of radio wiring and optical
    augmentation that make up the ghost talker. These units act as a
    built-in compad for the user and allow for reception and
    transmission of audio and visual recordings, the latter playing in
    an inset window in the user's field of vision. If the unit is
    operating outside of a standard comm grid, it has a transmission
    range of twenty kilometers and a reception range of one
    hundred. Ghost talker users can transmit basic visual diagrams and
    images to each other, as well as optical recordings.

-   ***<a id="org1fbb2b0"></a>:*** Usually implanted somewhere in the torso, a
    holdout cavity is a small recess shaped into the wearer's body and
    designed to be overlooked by most standard forms of medical or
    security scanning. It automatically defeats a security inspection
    that uses less than TL4 scanners, and even advanced tech requires
    careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it. The
    cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and is opened
    and shut by the user's mental command.

-   ***<a id="org4bbc515"></a>:*** Multiple holographic emitters are implanted on
    the user, allowing them to alter their external appearance to match
    anything of their approximate size and dimensions, including other
    people. Shifting appearances is a Main Action, and the user can't
    shift to an appearance that isn't in the cyberware's shape
    library. The library is vast and contains “generic” examples of
    numerous human-sized objects and people, but mimicking a specific
    other person requires at least five minutes of close
    examination. The holograms projected by the emitters are good, but
    imperfect; anyone who closely examines the user will be able to tell
    that something is artificial about their appearance, and touch
    instantly confirms any suspicions. The emitters can fake clothing
    and can produce sounds to complement the illusion or modify the
    user's voice, if records of the true subject are available. The
    disguise lasts until the user dies or ends it.

    -   ***<a id="org833ae47"></a>:*** This cyberware involves micronized
        neural stimulation technology which is imperceptible to anything
        short of TL5 medical scanning or TL4 surgical examination of the
        subject's brain tissue. When active, the IST allows the subject to
        adopt a secondary persona, complete with a library of manufactured
        memories. So long as the IST is active, the subject will honestly
        and completely believe himself to be the secondary persona, a
        conviction that cannot be penetrated by telepathy or TL4 methods of
        interrogation. The persona can be activated at the user's
        discretion, but it only deactivates on a preset trigger, leaving the
        subject in full possession of all memories experienced. The trigger
        can be any perceptible stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a
        specific person, a code phrase, or any other sign, and it may be
        changed by the user each time they activate the cyberware. Many ISTs
        are also implanted with a “master key” that will automatically
        deactivate the triggered identity.

    -   ***<a id="org2bcf808"></a>:*** This broad-spectrum scrub system
        carefully identifies and contains toxic substances introduced into
        the user's system. Whenever the subject would normally have to make
        a saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they may instead
        gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save. Most of
        these systems are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins or
        chemicals in standard use by police or military forces in the
        sector, but if presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the
        filters are less effective. In such cases, the most it can do is
        either grant a second saving throw if the first is failed, or grant
        a single saving throw if none is normally allowed.

    -   ***<a id="orgad17e91"></a>:*** A series of implants are wired to the
        user's brain stem, allowing them to trigger an induced therapeutic
        coma at a mental command. The user appears dead to anything short of
        a medical inspection, and has no need of respiration, food, or water
        while the coma is in effect. The user does not heal while in a coma,
        but any diseases or poisons also halt progression. The user
        determines how long the coma is to last before triggering it, and is
        unconscious for its duration. A character can survive in a coma up
        to two weeks before needing to regain consciousness for as long as
        they were in the coma.

    -   ***<a id="orgee51d35"></a>:*** While somewhat primitive by pretech
        standards, this TL5 cybernetic implant allows the wearer to gain a
        +3 bonus on all saving throws to resist telepathic intrusion. Even
        if such a save is failed, the user will be aware that they are under
        telepathic assault, though some forms of mental control may not
        allow them to say as much until after the influence is ended. The
        warning does not indicate the source of the influence.

    -   ***<a id="org1a237b1"></a>:*** Ocular adjustments to the wearer allow them
        to see clearly at any light level short of perfect darkness, in
        addition to giving them thermal vision that can easily distinguish
        shapes and distance even in the total absence of light. Dangerous
        radiation and lasers tuned outside the range of visible light are
        also visible to the user. Nearby radio transmissions can be seen as
        if they were visual flares of color. The system cannot translate
        these transmissions, only alert the user to them.

    -   ***<a id="org9df8ffb"></a>:*** Occasionally purchased by workers in hard
        vacuum or other hostile environments, pressure sheathing integrates
        an ultrathin pressure membrane with the user's dermis and emergency
        film sealants that trigger at the user's mental command. The
        pressure sheathing serves as an emergency vacc suit with an integral
        oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can sustain them for
        up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath needs 48 hours to regain
        structural integrity and power after triggering. A pressure sheath
        can be detected only by a close medical examination.

    -   ***<a id="org1380c48"></a>:*** Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and numerous
        internal organs can be replicated by postech medical science. These
        prosthetics can provide a good approximation of the sense of touch,
        and are usually impossible to distinguish from ordinary limbs
        without close inspection. Pretech-level worlds tend to prefer
        actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with access only to
        ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to be grateful to
        prosthetics.

    -   ***<a id="orgf512382"></a>:*** One of the more grotesque results of late
        pretech augmentation research, revenant wiring permeates the user's
        body with a web of supplementary limb actuators and sensor
        clusters. In combat, the user may designate up to a half-dozen
        targets to the system's braked micro-AI. If the user goes
        unconscious or is killed, the micro-AI will engage the limb
        actuators to keep fighting, even if the user is nothing more than a
        ragged mass of mangled tissue. The micro-AI is not brilliant, but it
        is capable of negotiating most terrain and dealing with physical
        impediments to killing the designated targets. The actuators have
        power to keep operating for 3d4 rounds, or until the wearer takes 25
        more hit points of damage, whichever comes first. The stress
        produced by revenant wiring makes it much more difficult to revive a
        downed user with Lazarus patches or biopsionics; all revivification
        chances are half normal.

    -   ***<a id="org7d486b5"></a>:*** A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the
        slowtime window was installed in crisis responders and others
        reliant on split-second decision making. When engaged, the implants
        accelerate the user's cogitation speed by more than three thousand
        percent. While there is no corresponding acceleration of the user's
        physical reflexes, they have time to process the situation and take
        in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime window cannot be
        surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how
        unexpected the attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful
        on the tissues, however, and one point of System Strain is gained
        each time it is engaged.

    -   ***<a id="org7b53f15"></a>:*** An intricate interweaving of
        microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted in the subject's
        torso and spinal column. These overrides can stabilize the user when
        severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced to
        0 hit points is automatically stabilized, as if a Lazarus patch had
        been successfully applied to them, assuming that a patch could have
        saved them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere with the
        ordinary operation of the user's organs, however, and the wearer's
        Constitution modifier is lowered by 1, with all the attendant
        consequences in loss of maximum hit points.

    -   ***<a id="orgef42ddc"></a>:*** While true nanotechnology is beyond the grasp of
        standard TL4 science, this cyber allows for the implantation of very
        simple nanofactories in the user, ones that exude a constant
        imperceptible “smart dust”. Objects the user touches can be tagged
        by these nanites, which generate more of their kind for up to 48
        hours after tagging. The dust then lays down a trail behind the
        tagged object, one that is visible to the user or to someone using a
        properly-keyed tracer. Only counter-nanite measures can remove the
        dust, as ordinary bathing or scrubbing is insufficient. The dust can
        be pinged by radio to announce its location to anyone within five
        kilometers, but most users prefer to leave the dust in passive mode,
        where it is undetectable to most TL4 sensors. Tagging an object adds
        one System Strain to the user.

    -   ***<a id="orgb43c404"></a>:*** The user's canines or fingernails are altered to
        allow for the injection of one of two types of poison. If the user
        attempts to inject an unsuspecting victim they are already touching,
        the attempt is automatically successful. If the victim is wary or in
        combat, they can only be affected if they are unarmored and the user
        succeeds in a Punch attack roll. On a success, the victim must make
        a Physical saving throw at -2 or be incapacitated by the poison,
        dying in 1d6 rounds or being incapacitated for 1d6 hours at the
        user's discretion. Each poison attack adds 2 System Strain to the
        user.

    -   ***<a id="orgf324955"></a>:*** Neural override fibers are woven into the
        user's hands and arms and linked to a perceptual modulator implanted
        at the base of the user's brain stem. When presented with a direct
        exercise of hand-eye coordination, the twitchlock can be engaged to
        produce superhuman accuracy and precision. Any attack roll or skill
        check reliant chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can be rerolled,
        though the power surge inflicts two points of System Strain on the
        user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this
        cyberware. While the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when
        engaged, the overrides fuzz ordinary nerve impulses and reduce the
        user's Dexterity modifier by 1 when active. Activating or
        deactivating the cyberware requires a Main Action.


<a id="artifacts"></a>

### Artifacts

Pretech artifacts are some of the more precious loot available from
lost Mandate military bases, abandoned colonies, desolate tomb worlds,
and forgotten research outposts. Most pretech on modern worlds was
long ago cannibalized for vital spare parts or destroyed by the
ravages of time and violence. The few pieces that remain are almost
always extremely valuable.

Very few pretech artifacts are bought or sold. Some items are
relatively common, having been ubiquitous enough to survive in large
numbers or simple enough to be produced by a few remaining modern
worlds. Most artifacts, however, are so rare that there is no
consistent market for them; an owner can charge what they wish for a
device.

Getting that price is a different matter. Few planetary governments
allow private ownership of “dangerous pretech artifacts”, and it's the
government that decides what constitutes danger. Most owners are
rapidly visited by firm, polite agents with heavily-armed backup and
given a “fair price” for their find.

As a consequence, most trade in pretech artifacts has to take place on
the black market, or on worlds or stations too lax to care about who
might be bringing in a portable black hole generator that just happens
to look like a Mandate child's toy. Such venues rarely provide much in
the way of security or contract enforcement, and so trade has to take
place amid grasping guards, paranoid participants, and regular theft.

Pretech artifacts are more often traded privately as rewards, mission
payments, or exchanges between owners. A PC who wants to obtain one of
the artifacts listed in this section will need to not only find
someone who will admit to possessing the gear, but also find out what
kind of favor they're going to need to part with it. Tens of thousands
of credits can sometimes do the trick, but most owners will prefer to
wring the maximum utility out of a capable adventurer's interest in
their prized possessions.


<a id="artifact-armor"></a>

### Artifact Armor

Many types of pretech armor are so rare or useful that they cannot
normally be acquired on the open market. Much like artifact weaponry,
these artifact armors are jealously held by those lucky enough to find
them.

-   ***<a id="org7de3ee5"></a>:*** This suit of stylish pretech clothing
    can self-modify in one minute to appear as any normal suit of
    clothing and grants AC 15 to the wearer. Originally designed for VIP
    protection, the executive security suit automatically stabilizes a
    mortally-wounded wearer provided they haven't taken enough damage to
    make revival impossible. Like the majority of pretech artifact
    armor, the suit is so light that it does not add to the wearer's
    encumbrance.

-   ***<a id="org7768881"></a>:*** Designed for use by elite infiltrators, a ghost
    mantle can warp light around the wearer to blur his or her outlines
    and coloring to match the surroundings. The mantle can self-modify
    in one minute to appear as any normal suit of clothing and grants AC
    15 to the wearer. When used in stealth mode, it grants a +2 bonus to
    all Stealth-related skill checks. TL4 sensors and scanners cannot
    detect the mantle as anything but ordinary cloth.

-   ***<a id="org86947a6"></a>:*** This variant form of assault suit employs
    pretech deforming polymers to create sealed joints and flexible
    armor plates that still maintain rigidity under impact. A polyplast
    carapace is treated as an assault suit with AC 18, except that it
    counts as only one item for encumbrance and requires no practice to
    use correctly. Integral kinetic absorption sinks allow the armor to
    function without the need for power cells.

-   ***<a id="org9bc1b70"></a>:*** One of the rare psitech artifacts
    originally designed for use by military combat psychics, this
    snug-fitting armored undersuit grants the wearer an AC of 16. Its
    special ability functions only for psychics; it can allow the user
    to reflexively fuel the suit's defenses with their own psychic
    reserves. As an Instant action, they can Commit Effort for the day
    to negate up to 15 points of damage from in incoming source of
    physical injury. Each time they do this, they must make a Mental
    saving throw or the psychic conversion shock leaves them unable to
    use psionic techniques until after the end of their next turn.

-   ***<a id="org38304ab"></a>:*** A modified version of the standard deflector
    array, a stutterjump suit grants the wearer a limited form of
    teleportation through integral psitech circuitry. As an Instant
    action, the wearer can teleport to any location within one hundred
    meters, provided they have an unobstructed line of sight to it. The
    suit's circuitry requires twelve hours to recover enough for another
    jump. The suit does not require power cells to function.

-   ***<a id="org92421e5"></a>:*** An enormously heavy suit of servo-actuated
    powered armor, Titan assault plate was favored by pretech boarding
    parties and space marines. It grants the wearer all the usual
    benefits of storm armor, but has a base AC of 21 and subtracts 2
    points of damage from every instance of harm suffered by the wearer.

-   ***<a id="org266e7fc"></a>:*** A modified version of the field emitter
    panoply, the TAA has all the functionality of the FEP but also does
    an automatic 1d6 damage to anyone who attacks the wearer in melee,
    inflicting the damage after the attack is resolved. The wearer is
    immune to Shock damage. Kinetic sinks allow the TAA to function
    without the need for power cells.


<a id="artifact-weaponry"></a>

### Artifact Weaponry

While generic pretech weaponry is of superb quality and manufacture,
some pieces exceed even the customary excellence of the
ancients. These “artifact” weapons are usually the product of short
production runs by master pretech craftsmen or individually-designed
masterpieces. Some pre-Scream manufacturers retain fame even centuries
later for the unique quality of their workmanship.

Artifact weapons are almost never found on the market. The few pieces
that are found and offered for sale are snapped up almost immediately
by elite operatives and others who rely on the quality of their
hardware to preserve their own lives. Most who have artifact weaponry
have either found it in a long-abandoned pretech cache, received it
from a superior, or taken it from the cold hands of a former
owner. Selling such a weapon tends to be equally difficult, with
buyers few and untrustworthy.

-   ***<a id="org8b86444"></a>:*** A company specializing in energy weaponry,
    AA pioneered several techniques for increasing the energy efficiency
    and penetrating power of their armaments. AA laser weapons ignore
    particulate matter when shooting, and all AA weapons gain +1 to hit
    and +2 damage.

-   ***<a id="orgdee4bf5"></a>:*** An armaments company dating from the First Wave
    of human colonization, Colonial Arms was famous for the incredible
    durability and versatility of their firearms. Their guns were
    largely self-repairing from anything short of having pieces torn
    off, and their projectile weapons automatically self-adjusted to
    fire whatever ammunition was available, in any environment from hard
    vacuum to underwater operations. A Colonial Arms projectile or
    energy weapon also gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls.

-   ***<a id="orgcd57e57"></a>:*** Those weapons designed by the transhuman
    hive-mind polity known as the Convergence are almost always
    energy-based guns found in sets of 2-5 matching weapons. Wielders
    can nominate a target as an Instant action at the start of each
    round; any attacks they make with the weapon against that target get
    a +1 hit and damage bonus for each wielder that targeted the foe,
    including their own nomination.

-   ***<a id="orgb7532f7"></a>:*** Ornate and beautiful weapons created shortly
    after the horror of the Scream, these arms were developed by an
    unknown pocket empire that somehow preserved a little of their
    pretech manufacturing base. Their attempt to reimpose order on the
    chaos around them appears to have failed, but their legacy lingers
    in the scattered weapons that remain from their far-flung armies. An
    Imperial weapon grants its user a +1 bonus to all hit and damage
    rolls, with projectile weapons having an unlimited supply of
    ammo. These weapons always remain immaculately clean.

-   ***<a id="org23a543a"></a>:*** This manufacturer specialized in laser and plasma
    weaponry. Their products were largely conventional in function, but
    the quality of craftsmanship was seldom surpassed. Fiat Lux weaponry
    grants +2 to hit rolls and damage.

-   ***<a id="org1401adc"></a>:*** The exact nature of the Nightfall Combine was
    unclear even before the Scream, with rumors of alien xenotech
    manufacturing techniques and esoteric psitech materials
    research. The weapons produced by the Combine were some of the
    finest ever developed by humanity. They grant +3 to all hit and
    damage rolls.

-   ***<a id="orga9b02aa"></a>:*** A pretech manufacturer who specialized in
    holdout weaponry, Omnipresence arms are composed of special
    polymorphic nano-compounds that are capable of shifting shape in
    moments. Omnipresence weaponry can take a single alternate shape of
    the same mass set during manufacture, usually a belt, necklace, or
    other seemingly innocuous object. When gripped and a short keycode
    is spoken, the item instantly shifts forms, containing whatever
    ammunition it was originally loaded with. Shifted Omnipresence
    weapons cannot be detected by any postech means; even a pretech
    scanner will only reveal that the object is composed of complex
    nanites. Omnipresence weapons grant +1 to hit and damage rolls.

-   ***<a id="orge90a9c0"></a>:*** Originally an organization of militant
    pan-planetary animists, PolyGaia armaments function perfectly in
    almost any environment. Projectile and energy weapons are also
    equipped with integral monoblades, and can be used as advanced
    medium melee weapons without a need to club the weapon. PolyGaia
    weaponry grants +1 to hit and damage rolls.

-   ***<a id="org6fbf2db"></a>:*** The Sons of Samael were one of the myriad peculiar
    religious and ideological groups that flourished during the Second
    Wave of human expansion. While their exact beliefs are unclear at
    this distance, their surviving melee armament is invariably
    superb. Monoblades, kinesis wraps, and other such SamaelTech
    weaponry all have +1 to hit and +1 damage. Some SamaelTech weapons
    appear to be decorated with Christian iconography and advanced
    nanotech cutting surfaces. These pieces grant +2 to hit and damage.

-   ***<a id="org245ca15"></a>:*** The “Stardust” system was a
    cutting-edge effort to use gravitic manipulation techniques in
    projectile weaponry. By giving a tiny flake of matter the mass
    profile of a bullet, a Stardust weapon never runs out of ammunition,
    albeit Stardust weaponry cannot burst fire. Stardust weaponry gains
    +1 on all hit and damage rolls.

-   ***<a id="org09bb944"></a>:*** The weapons of the Tempus Fugit armory employed
    Mandate temporal acceleration generators. Such acceleration is
    exhausting to the user, however, and creates severe strain on a
    normal biological system. As an Instant action, a wielder with the
    weapon in hand can take an additional full round of action any time
    they wish. At the end of this bonus action, they suffer 1d4 System
    Strain, +1 for each use of this ability within the past 24 hours. If
    their System Strain is maximized by this, they fall unconscious for
    one hour. Tempus Fugit weapons have a +1 bonus to hit and damage.

-   ***<a id="orgb8e0049"></a>:*** A sister-company to Tempus Fugit, the Terminus Est
    line of advanced melee weaponry employed spatial distortion
    technology. As an Instant action at the start of a round, a wielder
    with the weapon in hand can nominate a visible target; for the rest
    of the round, they're treated as if they're adjacent and engaged in
    melee combat with the target, hindering ranged attacks, subjecting
    them to attacks if they move away without a fighting withdrawal, and
    so forth. The wielder is not subject to attacks by the target unless
    they actually are within range of the target's weapons. By straining
    the wielder's perception pathways, this target nomination can be
    applied to a number of targets equal to the wielder's Stab skill
    plus two. Any attack made against one target is applied to all
    nominated targets, using the same die rolls. Each round this
    multiple nomination is maintained, the wielder takes 2 System
    Strain. All Terminus Est weapons have a +2 bonus to hit and damage
    rolls.

-   ***<a id="orgcce4084"></a>:*** A specialist weapon line designed by
    sage-engineers affiliated with the Preceptors of the Great Archive,
    the Tools are decorated with *taotie*-motif fittings similar to
    those of Shang Dynasty bronzes. Tools usually appear as melee
    weapons, particularly halberds, dagger-axes and swords, though
    stylized hypervelocity repeating crossbows have been found that work
    like mag rifles with unlimited ammo. The Tools function with a +2
    hit and damage bonus

-   ***<a id="org56c7f35"></a>:*** Somewhat stodgy by pretech standards, Valiance
    never embraced the more exotic potentials of pretech science. The
    company instead preferred to focus on precision low-recoil
    projectile weapons and high-quality craftsmanship. Valiance
    projectile weapons grant +2 to hit and damage rolls.

-   ***<a id="orgcf0c126"></a>:*** Windcutter armaments are invariably edged melee
    weapons. Their pretech manufacturers had an obsessive interest in
    maximizing weapon penetration, one carried to an extent that was
    very impressive, if perhaps somewhat impractical for field use. A
    Windcutter blade can slice through any substance short of advanced
    pretech armor plating, inflicting full normal damage on vehicles,
    including gravtanks or other targets subject only to Heavy
    weapons. For Shock purposes, all targets are treated as if they were
    AC 10. Against all targets, the blades have an effective +1 bonus to
    hit and damage.


<a id="artifact-equipment"></a>

### Artifact Equipment

-   ***<a id="org7210977"></a>:*** True AI was never easily made by pretech
    scientists. AIs required individual care during their development,
    and a disturbing percentage of them had to be “braked” at sub-human
    levels in order to prevent runaway cogitation on imponderable
    philosophical questions and the ensuing metastatic insanity that
    followed. Some AIs managed to attain a human level of sentience
    before requiring brakes. The less brilliant of these AIs could be
    contained in hardware no larger than five or six centimeters on a
    side, usually with integral sensors and vocalization units. If an AI
    companion takes a liking to a PC, they can be useful allies; they
    all have effective Program and Fix skills at level 3 or greater, and
    may have additional capabilities. A distressing number of these AIs
    have their own purposes, however, that are not necessarily
    complementary to those of their “owners”.

-   ***<a id="org1ef0003"></a>:*** Usually found in the form of a skinspray
    applicator, integrity stims restore 2d6+2 hit points to a subject
    for each dose applied. Each dose increases the target's System
    Strain by 1 point, and the stims are useless to those with maximized
    System Strain. More than one dose can be triggered into a subject in
    one round, but each dose after the first adds an additional second
    System Strain point from the sudden overload of stimulants.

-   ***<a id="orga3efd26"></a>:*** Originally designed for pretech shock troops,
    this skinspray stimulant charges the user with fearless aggression
    and indifference to pain. The user immediately gains 3d6 temporary
    hit points and +2 to hit for a period of ten rounds. At the end of
    that period, any remaining temporary hit points are lost, and the
    subject suffers -2 to hit for the next hour as their system
    recovers. Use of this stim adds 1 point of System Strain.

-   ***<a id="orgbd6f124"></a>:*** A sprayhypo laden with a revivifying
    cocktail of nanites and support chemicals, a micropurgator stim will
    remove 1d4 points of accrued System Strain from the user. Only one
    such stim can be applied to a person within 24 hours.

-   ***<a id="org32ea616"></a>:*** A transparent-visored helmet, this headpiece
    strengthens the integrity of the wearer's neural patterns, making it
    more difficult for them to be influenced by mind-affecting psionic
    powers. The wearer gains a +2 saving throw against any such attack,
    and is automatically alerted by the helmet if made the target of a
    telepathic power. The helmet does not help against purely physical
    psionic attacks, such as through telekinetics, and it cannot be worn
    with powered armor, vacc suits, or an assault suit.

-   ***<a id="orgb3256b8"></a>:*** Usually found in two-kilo cylinders with
    integral input-output data ports, polymorphic nanites were a
    late-Second Wave development that promised to revolutionize
    manufacturing. When fed a design schematic using standard pretech
    CAD/CAM protocols, the nanites exude into the desired object,
    mimicking any necessary physical properties. The nanites can be used
    to create any object of equivalent or lesser mass, provided a
    datapad or the equivalent is available to feed them the
    schematic. The nanites are single-use, but multiple cylinders can be
    linked together to create larger objects. The workmanship of the
    nanites is good, but not exceptional; any available schematic of
    tech level 4 or less can be produced.

-   ***<a id="org69f6ec6"></a>:*** While conventional TL4 nuke snuffers make dangerous
    nuclear reactions impossible near spaceships or modern civil defense
    systems, a pseudonuke is designed with esoteric pretech parts and
    techniques to bypass TL4 defenses. Most pseudonukes are no larger
    than a briefcase but can detonate with enough force to wipe out a
    large city or space station. The handful created before the Scream
    were deniable Mandate tools to deal with rebel frontier
    colonies. Those that survive are spectacularly illegal on almost all
    worlds.

-   ***<a id="org78991b7"></a>:*** When found, a redivivus sheath resembles a
    tightly-rolled body bag with a fistsized computing module affixed to
    it. When a freshly-dead human body is sealed into the bag the module
    releases a cloud of nanites to repair and revive the
    subject. Revivification will work on any victim no more than five
    minutes dead, assuming the head is intact and most of their mass is
    present. Subjects are revived in critically wounded condition with
    maximized System Strain. The redivivus sheath functions only once
    before burning out.

-   ***<a id="orgd8ef0ec"></a>:*** An array of pretech pharmaceuticals of
    truly heroic breadth, a sprayhypo full of system reset inductor is
    one of the most powerful concoctions ever devised by pretech
    biochemists. On injection, the subject immediately loses all accrued
    System Strain points barring those permanently added by
    cyberware. The user can gain new System Strain normally, but 48
    hours after the inductor has been administered, the strain will
    catch up with them. They fall immediately unconscious with 1 hit
    point and maximized System Strain, and will remain in a coma for 48
    hours before awakening. Use of a second inductor before the first
    has run its course will inevitably kill the subject within five
    rounds of application, with no hope of revival by psionic
    disciplines or conventional medical aid.

-   ***<a id="orge7ef5e0"></a>:*** Originally designed to facilitate spike drills
    for single-man ships that couldn't afford a sleeping pilot,
    wideawake serum gives the user enormous vigor and alertness for up
    to seven days at a time. The user need not sleep or even rest, but
    during this time it is impossible to recover accrued System
    Strain. A successful Heal check at difficulty 10, made at most once
    per day, can flush the drug from the user prematurely.


<a id="modding-and-building-equipment"></a>

### Modding and Building Equipment

While truly sophisticated research and design often requires resources
beyond the reach of an adventuring party, more modest workshops can
allow a talented technician with a healthy supply of after-market
parts to improve the quality of their own or their allies'
gear. Without a full-fledged R&D department behind them, a PC
technician is generally limited to modifying and improving existing
gear.

A mod is an adjustment made to a specific piece of tech to make it
work better. These mods are finicky, delicate, and often customized to
the user. They aren't generally available on the market because they
require regular tuning and adjustment by a highly-skilled technician
in order to keep them from degrading, or even failing entirely. Mods
require costly after-market parts that can be expensive to acquire,
and the most sophisticated ones require actual pretech salvage
stripped from advanced ancient technology. Normally, only TL4 gear can
be effectively modded, as more primitive tech isn't suitable for the
advanced components involved.


<a id="installing-mods"></a>

### Installing Mods

Building and installing a mod requires a wellequipped TL4 workshop.
It's not necessary to have a full-fledged fabrication plant, but the
sort of resources that a professional repair tech or vehicle shop have
are necessary to assemble and adjust the tech. Such a shop can usually
be rented for 100 credits a day, or bought outright in a city or other
urban area for 25,000 credits. A starship's “Workshop” ship fitting
will also qualify.

Mods have a minimum Fix skill required to install or maintain them; a
*Customized* mod requires Fix-1, for example, while a *Flexible* mod
takes Fix-2. Without this skill level, the tech can't build or install
the mod, and they can't maintain it properly either.

Mods have a cost in credits or salvage. A tech with access to a normal
TL4 parts market can buy components with a credit cost, but certain
highly sophisticated mods require pretech components that can only be
salvaged from certain ancient Mandate-era technological devices. Not
just any device will do for gathering these components; these
micronized fusion taps, antigrav nodules, impact flexors, and
polymorphic state controllers are found in only certain Mandate tech
or in rare ancient caches of unused components. A tech will usually
have to find these components as part of an adventure, because those
who have them need them for their own purposes and will not part with
them for ordinary monetary compensation. The specific details of these
parts don't matter for mod use, and they're simply tracked as
“salvage”. If a mod requires three units of salvage, any three units
will work, and it's not normally necessary for a tech to track down
specific components.

Mods take time to build and install. It takes one week per minimum
skill level of the mod to build and install it in the desired
device. Thus, a *Customized* mod takes a week to put in, while a
*Flexible* mod takes two. If a tech does nothing other than work, eat,
and sleep, they can halve these times, and an additional assistant
with at least Fix-0 skill can further halve the time.

Mods must be custom-built to specific objects. A tech cannot build a
“generic” mod and then just attach it to a device; it must be
carefully designed to fit exactly with that specific item, and
sometimes even with a specific user.


<a id="mods-and-maintenance"></a>

### Mods and Maintenance

Mods require maintenance to keep functioning correctly. Overclocked
hardware, bleeding-edge tech, and experimental adjustments just don't
have the field durability of more standard gear, so a tech must apply
daily attention to the modded hardware if it's not to fail. A normal
TL4 toolbox is required to maintain mods, but no special parts are
needed.

A tech's Maintenance score is equal to the total of their Intelligence
and Constitution modifiers plus three times their Fix skill level. The
smarter and the longer a tech can work, the more maintenance they can
perform, but their overall expertise as a technician is the most
crucial element. A tech can maintain a number of mods equal to their
Maintenance score without cutting into their adventuring time or
otherwise encumbering their off-duty hours. This maintenance is
assumed to take place during downtime and doesn't need to be tracked
specifically in play. If they do nothing but maintenance, they can
double their score, but this kind of dedication requires sixteen-hour
workdays.

If a mod goes without maintenance for 24 hours, it stops working. If a
mod goes without maintenance for a week, the entire device it's
attached to stops working, as the untuned mod has made it useless or
dangerous to use. Weapons can no longer be used in combat, armor no
longer gives protection, seizes up, or is too dangerous to wear, and
other devices simply stop functioning. A maintenance backlog on a
device can be cleared by an hour of work by a technician capable of
maintaining it.


<a id="building-conventional-gear"></a>

### Building Conventional Gear

Sometimes a wrench jockey will want to build their own equipment
rather than purchase it off the shelf. This may be because there's no
such gear for sale, the equipment is illegal on this world, the tech
wants it cheaper than the vendors sell it, or the tech wants to build
a custom platform for their favorite mods. The gear built this way
must be feasible to create in a workshop; guns, armor, and
modestly-sized vehicles are possible, but starship components and
other major constructions are not.

A tech requires a TL4 workshop to build most TL4 equipment. More
primitive gear can be built with less elaborate resources at the GM's
discretion. The workshop must be at least nominally capable of working
with the kind of gear the tech is building. A vehicle repair shop will
not have the tools to brew pharmaceuticals, and a back-room
electronics shop won't have the lifts to work on armored vehicles. If
the tech needs to refit a workshop to work on a particular type of
unsupported gear, they can pay half the shop's original price to get
the needed tools. [Starships](#chapter-starships) with *Workshop* fittings are always
sufficient for personal gear modifications.

The tech needs a supply of parts. In any TL4 city or sizable
community, the tech can scrounge, barter, or buy what they need from
the locals. A tech working in a shop out in the wilds can prepare by
taking a few footlockers full of materials that can fit in a vehicle
or on pack animals, buying a certain number of credits worth of spare
parts and hauling them along. Techs in dire need can strip ancient
high-tech ruins, battlefields, and scrap heaps for parts if no better
source is available.

Techs must decide whether the device they're building is to be
jury-rigged, normal, or mastercrafted. Jury-rigged devices are
assembled out of cheap scrap, bottom-tier components, and makeshift
kludges. They're much cheaper to make than to buy, but they require
constant attention to keep them operating. Normal devices work just as
well as anything that you'd buy off the shelf, but the lack of
economies of scale and the need to acquire all the parts at retail
make them more expensive than buying it off the shelf. Mastercrafted
gear is carefully built to support a tech's own innovations and
favorite modifications. They are extremely expensive, but much easier
to mod and maintain than off-the-shelf tech.

Building the gear usually takes one month for a vehicle and one week
for a weapon, suit of armor, or other portable device. Having at least
one assistant with Fix-0 will halve this time.

Jury-rigged devices cost one-quarter as much as the normal device and
take half the normal time to build. If the tech has access to scrap or
salvage, they can assemble it at no cost, but it takes twice the
normal time to build it. A jury-rigged device counts as a mod
requiring Fix-0 to maintain. If it goes 24 hours without maintenance,
it stops working. Jury-rigged devices cannot be modded.

Normal devices cost twice as much as they would off-the-shelf and take
the normal amount of time to build. They cannot be built with scrap or
salvaged parts unless the GM decides that the salvage is perfectly
suited for this use. Drugs and other consumable goods must be built as
normal devices rather than jury-rigged or mastercrafted ones.

Mastercrafted devices require costly premade components and cost ten
times as much as the normal device, and require twice as much time to
build. They are ideal platforms for the tech's own modifications,
however, and the first mod installed in the device requires no
maintenance.


<a id="sample-mods"></a>

### Sample Mods

The mods listed below are simply a sample of those a GM might approve
for their campaign. Weapon and armor mods should not stack beyond a +3
bonus to AC, hit rolls or damage rolls, and any mod improving a skill
check shouldn't boost it by more than +1. A mod can only be installed
once on any given piece of equipment.

-   ***<a id="orge6edd72"></a> (Fix-2):*** The weapon has had micronized kinetic
    targeting aids installed, granting a +1 bonus to hit rolls with
    it. Costs 4,000 credits.

-   ***<a id="org78bf8c4"></a> (Fix-2):*** The weapon has been tuned for greater damage
    output, adding +2 to the damage it does. Costs 2,000 credits.

-   ***<a id="orgfcdcf6d"></a> (Fix-1):*** The armor is equipped with automatic
    pressure seals and emergency oxygen. It can be triggered manually or
    activates automatically on exposure to low pressure, functioning as
    a vacc suit for up to one hour. Costs 5,000 credits.

-   ***<a id="org03d1576"></a> (Fix-2):*** The device is disguised as a specific
    different object of the same general mass. This disguise will fool
    standard TL4 sensors, but not a close physical inspection of the
    object. Costs ten times the device's base cost.

-   ***<a id="org759967b"></a> (Fix-1):*** The weapon or armor has been carefully
    tailored to a single specific user. When used by that person, they
    get a +1 to hit with the weapon or a +1 Armor Class bonus with
    armor. Costs 1,000 credits and is inapplicable to shields.

-   ***<a id="orgc61f32d"></a> (Fix-1):*** The firearm has been adjusted so that
    its magazine size is doubled. Costs 500 credits.

-   ***<a id="orgf477a19"></a> (Fix-2):*** The armor is carefully tailored to a specific
    wearer with an eye towards reducing its weight and
    cumbersomeness. Its Encumbrance value is lowered by 1 for that
    wearer, and increased by 1 for anyone else. Costs 5,000 credits.

-   ***<a id="org57e3731"></a> (Fix-1):*** A device with a duration of operation,
    such as a vacc suit or fueled vehicle, now functions for 50% longer
    on the same charge. Costs five times the device's usual cost.

-   ***<a id="orgcd0aa32"></a> (Fix-3):*** The firearm now automatically
    produces its own physical ammunition. Costs 10,000 credits and two
    units of pretech salvage.

-   ***<a id="org6ab9095"></a> (Fix-3):*** A device powered by a Type A power cell
    now never runs out of power. Costs 5,000 credits and one unit of
    pretech salvage.

-   ***<a id="org554f466"></a> (Fix-3):*** The weapon is tuned to partially phase through
    armor and impeding debris, granting a +1 bonus to hit rolls with
    it. Costs 10,000 credits and two units of pretech salvage.

-   ***<a id="org061a9cc"></a> (Fix-2):*** The armor can shift in appearance
    to that of normal clothing or different-looking armor. Several dozen
    different appearances can be loaded into it at any one time. The
    armor functions and encumbers normally regardless of its external
    appearance. Costs 5,000 credits and one unit of pretech salvage.

# STARSHIPS

Countless ships rise from world upon world, the iron dust of
new-forged shipyards sent out to make bridges between the stars. For
centuries, the privation and chaos that followed the Scream have made
any concern beyond bare survival a luxury for all too many worlds. The
last century has seen a reawakening, however, as myriad planets
finally unlock the secrets of their own worlds and learn to use their
native resources to rebuild the longlost ships of their ancestors. The
Silence is ending and worlds are now beginning to reach out to their
unknown neighbors.

Different sectors have different degrees of development. In some
regions of space, starships have now been manufactured for centuries,
with small spacecraft easily obtained by private individuals and
modest companies. These sectors have regular commerce between worlds,
with interstellar drills no more remarkable than modern air
travel. Aliens and offworlder humans are noticed but go without
special remark. These sectors often have relatively large stellar
polities made up of numerous member stars, ones which often share the
same general culture or political form. These sectors may still have
backward planets or unknown worlds, but these are the exception.

In most ***Stars Without Number*** sectors, however, things aren't that
developed. Some worlds will have developed or retained functional
shipyards and interstellar flight is not anything remarkable to their
citizens, but ownership of a starship is still a rare thing. Entire
planetary navies might have fewer than a dozen ships, and only
powerful and influential worlds will be sporting cruisers or other
heavy warships. There is enough commercial traffic to justify
starports and trade stations, but free and easy transit between worlds
has been lost for centuries, and is only slowly returning to the
sector.

These sectors are rich in potential adventure. Even developed worlds
may not be completely familiar with their stellar neighbors, and a
number of lost worlds and out-of-contact societies can still be found
in the sector. Starship captains can never be entirely certain what
they're going to meet when they drill into such a system, and no world
is strong enough to exert its will carelessly around distant stars.


<a id="acquiring-starships"></a>

## Acquiring Starships

In most sectors, it's possible to buy civilian starships on any TL4
world. Such civilian ships are almost exclusively fighter or
frigate-class hulls, most usually free merchants or in-system
shuttles, though a few wealthy worlds offer bulk freighter hulls as
well. These ships might be armed to the extent that their buyer's
purse allows, but they are no match for real warships, and so few
planets worry too much about who might buy them. Conspicuous
acquisition of numerous armed merchants, however, might draw unwelcome
interest.

Military hulls are a different matter. Even a lowly patrol boat is
rarely permitted to a civilian buyer, let alone a fleet cruiser or
other ship of the line. Even when these ships can be purchased,
crewing them adequately can be far beyond the limits of an adventuring
party's purse. Even so, heroes who make the right friends or do the
right favors to a planetary government can sometimes get letters of
marque that entitle them to purchase hulls that would not normally be
allowed into civilian hands.

Buying a ship is only one way to acquire it, however. Many adventurers
find it more efficient to liberate a craft from undeserving owners,
with an evening's play revolving around the daring deeds and cunning
subterfuge needed to acquire or salvage a ship for the party. Of
course, the craft acquired by this means are rarely in perfect
condition.

The ship and fitting prices that follow in this section assume that
starships are uncommon and expensive investments, as they are in most
sectors. If you are running a campaign in a region of easier access to
ships, you should halve or even quarter the prices.


<a id="navies-and-piracy"></a>

## Navies and Piracy

Most TL4 worlds have some sort of space navy, even if it's only a
handful of patrol boats to watch the asteroid mines and monitor
orbital space around their homeworld. A typical poor world might have
a corvette and a half-dozen patrol boats, while the average TL4 planet
sports a fleet cruiser, four corvettes or heavy frigates, and ten
patrol boats, and a rich planet might have three times as many ships,
possibly even a battleship or carrier to form the heart of its
fleet. A third of these ships are usually in dock at any one time.

The threat of piracy varies from system to system. Pirates need a safe
place to refit their ships and sell their stolen goods, and they need
enough traffic to justify their trade. The ideal pirate system is one
containing only a low-tech primitive world that can be raided for
slaves and supplies, with a hidden or mobile deep-space repair base
for maintenance, and two or more wealthy neighboring systems that send
trade through. Such a pirate nest can persist for years, with system
governments arguing over who should bear the cost of rooting them out,
or too weak to overcome a charismatic pirate leader and their
loot-hungry followers.

Very few pirates operate in a system with a strong naval
presence. Small ships can sometimes get away with it for a time,
hiding out in asteroid belts, striking merchants from ambush, and
fleeing to safer systems before help can arrive. Larger pirate
flotillas are a more existential threat to a planetary navy, and they
are soon dispersed&#x2026; or made the effective masters of the system as
they blow up any ship that could prevent them from obtaining space
supremacy.


<a id="building-a-starship"></a>

## Building a Starship

Creating a starship in ***Stars Without Number*** is fairly simple, and
requires only a few steps.

First, pick a hull type for the ship from the list below. The type
will indicate the price of the base hull with a drive-1 spike drive,
along with the available free power and mass.

Second, add fittings, weapons, and defenses from the pages that
follow. Each such addition takes up a certain amount of power and
mass, and may have a minimum hull size required for installation. Some
fittings and defenses cost more in money, power, or mass when
installed on larger ships.

Third, decide how many crew members the ship will have. Most
merchantmen run with no more than twice the minimum number of crew to
save on wages. Warships rarely leave port with less than 75% of the
maximum crew allowed. On average, crew members cost 100 credits a day
in wages, plus 20 more for necessary food and stores. PCs, naturally,
are unlikely to charge themselves wages, but they need to eat.

Fourth, note down the six-month maintenance cost of the ship, which is
equal to 5% of its total non-crew cost. If this fee isn't paid, a -1
penalty is applied to all skill checks and hit rolls related to the
ship for each maintenance period skipped.

Lastly, fill in a ship record for the craft, marking down the ship's
statistics and the attack bonuses for the gunners using the ship's
weapons.

The speed of building or modifying a ship will depend on the quality
of available shipyards and the political importance of the job. On
average, 25,000 credits a day of work or modifications can be done by
most shipyards on average-importance jobs. Enough reason to rush can
double or even quadruple this amount.


<a id="starship-hulls"></a>

## Starship Hulls

Starship hulls are divided into four general hull classes: fighters,
frigates, cruisers, and capital ships. The size of each class varies
depending on the technological sophistication and available resources
of their creators. In some sectors a smuggler's free merchant frigate
might measure no more than 34.75 meters from nose to tail, while in
another it might be four times as large. As a general proportion, each
class' average size is usually from four to eight times larger than
the class before it.

Each hull has several base attributes. Individual models might vary
slightly, and careful tuning and customization might alter these
numbers as described later, but most ships of a given hull type will
perform as listed.

-   ***Cost*** is the price of the base hull with a drive-1 class spike
    drive. Any military hull type is generally unavailable without very
    good naval contacts with a shipyard's owning government or a
    carefully-placed favor to those in authority.

-   ***Speed*** is the relative combat speed and maneuverability of a
    ship. Over long distances a ship's spike drive rating is all that
    matters, but in the tight quarters of combat this can make a great
    difference. A ship's Speed is added to all Pilot skill checks made
    by the craft's pilot, whether in combat or performing other
    maneuvers.

-   ***Armor*** is the measure of the ship's plating and redundant
    systems, and is subtracted from any incoming damage from hostile
    fire or hazardous space environments. Ship-mounted weapons with the
    Armor Piercing trait may ignore part or all of this rating. Ships
    generally cannot be harmed by anything short of other ship's guns,
    vehicle-mounted Heavy weapons or carefully-placed demo charges.

-   ***Hit Points*** reflects the amount of damage the ship can take
    before it explodes or becomes inoperable.

-   ***Crew*** lists the minimum crew necessary for basic operation and
    the maximum crew the life support system can sustain for two
    months. Smaller crews than the maximum will make the ship's life
    support last proportionately longer. While it's theoretically
    possible for a lone crewman to make a successful spike drill, the
    constant vigilance and wakefulness required mandates the use of
    heavy pharmaceuticals and great desperation. A minimum of three crew
    are normally required for a relatively safe drill.

-   ***Armor Class*** is a combination of agility and effective ECM
    denoting the difficulty of landing a solid hit on the ship.

-   ***Power*** is the amount of free power available after the ship's
    basic operation is taken into account. Fittings and weapons take up
    some part of this power.

-   ***Mass*** records the amount of free mass left unassigned by the
    hull's design. This free mass can be filled with fittings, weapons,
    or cargo holds.

-   ***Hardpoints*** indicate how many weapons a ship can successfully
    mount. Most weapons take up one hardpoint, though particularly large
    or power-hungry ones may take up more than that.

Finally, the ***class*** of the particular hull shows the general size
of the ship. Some fittings and weapons have a minimum hull class,
beneath which a ship is just too small to successfully install the
hardware.

Starship hulls are sturdy enough to ignore damage from small arms or
TL3 Heavy weapons. TL4 Heavy weapons or demo charges applied to the
exterior of a ship do half damage minus the ship's Armor. If a
saboteur gets inside with such weapons, the damage is halved but Armor
does not apply. Use of some Heavy weapons in confined areas may be
decidedly imprudent.


<a id="hull-types"></a>

## Hull Types

The hull types listed below are some of the most common models found
throughout the remnants of human space. Individual worlds often
experiment with different vessels as they gradually develop their own
astronautic doctrines, but these models have the benefit of long and
proven utility.

-   ***<a id="orgb591515"></a>:*** Small craft, often modified to replace the spike
    drive with a system drive. Their speed, cheapness, and combat
    utility make them a popular choice as inexpensive system patrol
    craft.

-   ***<a id="orga5ac31d"></a>:*** The smallest craft that's regularly used for
    interstellar drills, a shuttle is a cheap means of moving small
    amounts of precious material or important persons between worlds.

-   ***<a id="org281355b"></a>:*** A hull type much beloved by adventurers, a free
    merchant has unimpressive combat utility but can carry substantial
    amounts of cargo while mounting enough weaponry to discourage
    small-craft piracy.

-   ***<a id="org7851fb0"></a>:*** The hull of choice for customs cutters and system
    law enforcement, the patrol boat is a light frigate built heavy
    enough to overawe small merchant vessels while still being
    relatively cheap to build and crew.

-   ***<a id="org56988fe"></a>:*** The smallest true combat frigate, and often simply
    called a “frigate” by spacers. Corvettes have significantly thicker
    armor than patrol boats and trade additional crew needs and less
    maneuverability for more available free mass.

</table>

-   ***<a id="org9826278"></a>:*** The heaviest starship that most poor or
    resource-deprived worlds can build, the heavy frigate can carry a
    significant loadout of weaponry and has enough crew to overwhelm
    most pirate ships if it comes to a boarding action. While it packs a
    substantial punch, it lacks the armor of a true cruiser-class
    warship.

-   ***<a id="orgfa608fe"></a>:*** This class of huge cargo ship is found most
    often in peaceful, heavily-populated sectors.

-   ***<a id="orgeddea72"></a>:*** The favored ship of the line of most wealthy,
    advanced worlds, and often the biggest and most powerful ship most
    planets can build. A cruiser's heavy armor and infrastructural
    support for heavy guns make it a lethal weapon against frigates and
    any other ship not optimized for cracking heavy armor. They can
    prove vulnerable to swarm attacks by fighter-bombers equipped with
    the right kind of armor-piercing weapons.

-   ***<a id="org5a3fb26"></a>:*** Dreaded hulks of interstellar war, very few worlds
    have the necessary technology or economy to support the massive
    expense of building and crewing a battleship. Those that do gain
    access to a ship that is largely invulnerable to anything short of
    specially-designed anti-capital cruisers or hunter-killer frigates.

-   ***<a id="org42a61d8"></a>:*** The queen of a fleet, even fewer polities can afford to
    build one of these huge ships. Carriers can support flights of
    fighter or frigate-class warships, ones specially equipped to handle
    particular missions. This versatility allows it to load
    fighter-bombers for anti-capital missions one month, and then switch
    to swarms of hunter-killer frigates the next when a hostile system's
    asteroid outposts need to be destroyed. Stripped of its combat
    wings, however, a carrier has less individual firepower than a
    cruiser.

-   ***<a id="org74a0e9d"></a>:*** Almost every space-faring world has at least one space
    station in orbit. A station has no Speed score, no spike drive, and
    cannot perform any maneuvers in combat, though its transit jets can
    slowly move it around a solar system over a matter of
    weeks. Civilian trade stations allow for docking by bulk freighters
    and ships not cleared to land on the surface, while military
    stations strictly forbid any civilian docking. The small station
    listed here is a Bannerjee-12, a common model found on poor or
    backwater worlds with little traffic. The large station represents
    an Arx, a major trade station for a hub world with money to spare.

## Starship Fittings

The following list of ship fittings are largely standard TL4
technologies that are available in most sectors. A few items on the
list are rare pretech devices that cannot be acquired without special
connections or a lucky feat of salvage.

Some costs are marked with an asterisk. These costs are multiplied by
10 when the fitting is installed in a frigate-class hull, by 25 when
installed in a cruiser-class hull, and by 100 when installed in a
capital ship.

Some power and mass entries are marked with a hashmark. These costs
are multiplied by 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital
ships, rounded up. Note that you apply these multipliers even if the
fitting only works on a large ship; a frigate with a *Drill Course
Regulator* pays 250,000 credits, not 25,000.

-   ***<a id="orga730363"></a>:*** A lab suitable for investigating alien
    xenolife, planetary geology, esoteric technology, and other
    mysteries of the cosmos. The lab contains cold sleep pods adequate
    to contain alien samples, viro-shielded research cells, high-energy
    lasers, and other requisite tools. When used to investigate some
    phenomenon or object, any applicable skill rolls are improved by +1
    for a frigate lab, +2 for a cruiser lab, and +3 for a capital ship
    lab.

-   ***<a id="org81b329b"></a>:*** Forging new spike courses is too much an
    art to rely on computerized assistance, but an advanced nav computer
    can help on well-mapped routes. When navigating an interstellar
    drill course with charts less than a year old, the navigator
    decreases drill difficulty by 2.

-   ***<a id="org2ef803c"></a>:*** This fitting includes the benefits of the
    *Atmospheric Configuration* fitting, as well as allowing the ship to
    operate while immersed in a liquid medium. Submerged ships cannot be
    detected with conventional planetary traffic sensors and require
    military sonar and naval sensors to fix their position, resources
    often unavailable on less developed worlds. So long as the ship
    stays away from military naval craft and bases, it is almost
    impossible to track while submerged. Only fighter and frigate hull
    classes can mount this fitting.

-   ***<a id="orgdab3d08"></a>:*** Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment,
    a captain can simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever
    amounts of TL4 military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might
    require, and integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There
    is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use,
    but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete it.

-   ***<a id="orgddaa8f1"></a>:*** This fitting must be put in place
    when the ship is built, and cannot be installed on cruiser-class or
    larger ships. A ship designed for atmospheric flight can land on
    most solid or aqueous surfaces.

-   ***<a id="orgb127733"></a>:*** Some ships run with more guns than
    crewmen. A single NPC or PC can man one gun per round, firing it as
    often as the gunnery chief's *Fire One Weapon* or *Fire All Guns*
    actions allow, but sometimes that's not enough. Installing an
    autonomic targeting system for a gun allows it to shoot at a +2 hit
    bonus without human assistance. This system must be installed once
    for each gun that is to be self-manned.

-   ***<a id="org544877c"></a>:*** The ship has been carefully fitted to
    support the use of non-sentient expert system robots in its
    operation. At least one human, VI, or True AI crew member is
    necessary to oversee the bots and monitor spike drills, but
    otherwise crew may be replaced with cheap, basic robots at a cost of
    1,000 credits per crew member replaced. Bots don't draw pay, don't
    take up life support, and their maintenance is assumed to be part of
    the ship's operating costs. These bots are incapable of any actions
    unrelated to operating the ship and are treated as level-0 in their
    skills where relevant.

-   ***<a id="org7ac9a13"></a>:*** Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter
    apertures can be used to forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided
    the target's engines have been disabled. Ships without boarding
    tubes have to send invaders across empty space to either make an
    assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded airlock or cut their way in
    through the hull with laser cutters and half an hour of work.

-   ***<a id="org58986f9"></a>:*** Cruisers and larger craft can't land on planetary
    bodies, so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo
    lighter is only capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes
    roughly twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to a standard
    pressurized cargo container holding up to 200 tons of cargo and
    passengers. These containers are usually collapsible and take up no
    significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they're not
    simply disposable cargo shells. This fitting can be purchased
    multiple times.

-   ***<a id="orgeaec17e"></a>:*** Free mass can be traded for pressurized cargo
    space. Tracked by weight for convenience, one cubic meter is usually
    one ton, with most vehicles requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks
    taking 25, and aircraft or mechs taking up 50 tons of cargo
    space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons of cargo space in a
    fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200 tons in a cruiser, and 2000 tons
    in a capital-class ship. This fitting can be purchased multiple
    times.

-   ***<a id="orgd1539c0"></a>:*** These stasis pods can keep a subject alive for
    centuries provided that the ship's power doesn't fail. Each
    installation allows for keeping a number of people equal to the
    ship's maximum crew in stasis indefinitely. This fitting can be
    installed multiple times.

-   ***<a id="org6b54d3d"></a>:*** The ship has been designed to act as the core of a
    future settlement. Once this fitting is engaged, the ship ceases to
    be operational as a starship, and builds out into a set of habitats,
    hydroponic gardens, fusion plants, and living spaces sufficient to
    support up to five times its maximum crew, including enough
    fabrication and workshop facilities to keep the settlement
    operational under normal conditions. The settlement can be a
    deep-space hab, orbital installation, or planetary settlement. In
    the latter case, the ship must land to form the settlement; even
    ships without atmospheric operations can do so, but they can never
    take off again. Once activated, a colony core cannot be re-packed.

-   ***<a id="org9a39540"></a>:*** Drills along a known spike drive route
    have no chance of failure so long as the route is no longer than
    twice the operating pilot's skill level and does not involve course
    trimming. Thus, a navigator with Pilot-1 skill would always succeed
    in making a drill of two hexes or less, provided the route was a
    known one. The drill course regulator requires a sophisticated
    technical base and compatible metadimensional energy conditions in a
    given sector; many sectors no longer have this technology or lack
    the right environment to use it. If the GM prefers a campaign where
    space travel is always at least somewhat dangerous, they may deny
    access to this fitting. Ships piloted by exceptionally talented
    navigators may choose not to mount it even then.

-   ***<a id="org96bf9f9"></a>:*** A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1
    spike drive with additional phase filters and power throughput
    refinements. A captain needs buy only the final grade of drive
    desired. He does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives of
    rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that cannot be built
    most modern worlds.

-   ***<a id="org3b412eb"></a>:*** Armored and stealthed versions of cargo lighters,
    these craft are twice as fast, apply a -3 penalty to tracking and
    targeting skill checks, and can carry up to one hundred troops or
    passengers. Many are equipped with assorted Heavy weapons to clear
    the landing zone, and can be treated as flight-capable gravtanks for
    purposes of combat. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.

</table>

-   ***<a id="org1731f2b"></a>:*** Stealth systems can mask the ship's energy
    emissions through careful modulation of the output. All travel times
    inside a star system are doubled when the system is engaged, but any
    skill checks to avoid detection gain a +2 bonus.

-   ***<a id="org962abbb"></a>:*** These banked rows of compressed cold sleep pods are
    designed to carry enormous numbers of people in extended
    hibernation, most often colonists to some new homeworld or escapees
    from some stellar disaster. A cruiser can carry up to 1,000
    colonists in stasis, while a capital ship can handle up to
    5,000. Each further time this fitting is selected, these numbers
    double. These pods put their inhabitants into very deep hibernation
    so as to minimize the resources necessary to maintain their
    lives. Bringing them out of this stasis requires a month of
    “defrost”. Crash awakenings have a 25% chance of killing the
    subject. The pods are rated for 100 years of stasis, but their
    actual maximum duration is somewhat speculative.

-   ***<a id="org7b5f297"></a>:*** The ship can be designed to accommodate a
    larger number of crew or passengers. Extended life support can be
    fitted multiple times; each time, the maximum crew rating of the
    ship increases by 100% of its normal maximum. Thus, a free merchant
    who installs this twice can have a maximum complement of 18 people.

-   ***<a id="org3b26b4b"></a>:*** All ships are equipped with basic medical
    facilities for curing lightly injured crew members and keeping the
    seriously injured ones stable until reaching a planet. An extended
    medbay improves those facilities, allowing for the medical treatment
    of up to the ship's entire maximum crew at once, including the
    treatment of critically wounded passengers.

-   ***<a id="org6b7253a"></a>:*** A normal complement of ship's stores can keep
    the maximum crew size supplied for two months. Each selection of
    *Extended Stores* doubles that time, and can be fitted multiple
    times.

-   ***<a id="org3e46be7"></a>:*** Most ships require refueling after each drill
    jump, no matter the distance. Installing fuel bunkers allows the
    ship to carry one additional load of fuel. This fitting can be
    installed multiple times for ships that wish to minimize fueling.

-   ***<a id="org924cfa7"></a>:*** Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction
    of hydrogen from gas giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The
    extraction process requires four days of processing and refinement,
    but completely refuels the ship. Such fittings are common on
    explorer craft that cannot expect to find refueling stations.

-   ***<a id="orgf0f9f13"></a>:*** Some ships are designed to produce food
    and air supplies for the crew. Selecting hydroponic production
    allows for the indefinite supply of a number of crewmen equal to the
    ship's maximum crew. This option may be taken multiple times for
    farm ships, in which case each additional selection doubles the
    number of people the ship can support.

-   ***<a id="org7dd036c"></a>:*** Selecting this fitting equips the ship with a number
    of single-use escape craft capable of reaching the nearest habitable
    planet or station in a star system. If no such destination exists,
    the boats can maintain their passengers for up to a year in drugged
    semi-stasis. Lifeboats have fully-functional comm systems and are
    usually equipped with basic survival supplies and distress
    beacons. A single selection of this fitting provides enough
    lifeboats for a ship's maximum crew, with up to twenty people per
    boat.

-   ***<a id="org5956b29"></a>:*** Each time this fitting is selected, 10% of the
    ship's maximum crew gain access to luxury cabins of a spaciousness
    sufficient to please a wealthy star-farer. This fitting comes with
    the usual zero-gee athletic courts, decorative fountains, fine
    dining, and artistic fittings.

-   ***<a id="org2191229"></a>:*** Automated mining and refinery equipment has
    been built into the ship, allowing it to extract resources from
    asteroids and planetary surfaces. Careful extraction of specific
    lodes of valuable minerals can be quite profitable at the GM's
    discretion, but if the crew is simply melting down available
    asteroids for raw materials, the unit can refine one ton of usable
    materials per day worth about 500 credits in most markets. These raw
    materials can be used to feed a mobile factory, and a ship may have
    more than one mobile extractor fitted to it to multiply the return
    if sufficient raw feedstock is available. Operating an extractor
    requires at least five crew members.

-   ***<a id="org6b57f71"></a>:*** The ship is equipped with a fullscale TL4
    fabrication plant programmed to support its needs. The ship can
    stock raw materials and parts at 5,000 credits per ton; these parts
    can then be used to “pay” ship repair or maintenance costs when
    conventional shipyards are unavailable. The factory can also create
    and repair vehicles, TL4 equipment, space habs, and planetary
    structures with these parts at a rate of 10,000 credits worth of
    construction a day. If a mobile extractor is available, the raw
    materials processed by the latter unit can be used to feed the
    factory. Operating a mobile factory requires at least 100
    well-trained personnel. Each 10 fewer available doubles repair or
    maintenance times.

-   ***<a id="orgccfdccc"></a>:*** An extremely rare example of psitech
    dating from before the Scream, a precognitive nav chamber allows a
    character with at least Precognition-2 psionic skill to assist in
    interstellar drills, sensing impending shear alterations before they
    happen. The navigator automatically succeeds on any spike drill
    check of difficulty 9 or less. On a failed check, add 2 to the Spike
    Drive Mishap roll, limiting the potential damage. On drilling in to
    the destination system, the psychic has expended all Effort in the
    process.

-   ***<a id="org18e106f"></a>:*** This pretech relic is unavailable on the
    open market in most sectors. Once installed in a ship, it can be
    “imprinted” by up to a dozen psychics. These psychics can sense and
    affect any object or location within ten meters of the relic after
    one minute of concentration, provided they are within the same solar
    system. Thus, teleporters can always teleport next to the
    anchorpoint, telepaths can always contact anyone within the affected
    zone, telekinetics can manipulate objects near the relic, and so
    forth. The relic can be recoded to eliminate existing imprints, but
    any psychic who gets access to the relic for ten minutes of
    meditation and focus can imprint on it afterwards. There is no
    obvious way to tell how many psychics have imprinted to the
    anchorpoint.

-   ***<a id="org6ccc3d7"></a>:*** The ship can disguise its long-range sensor
    readings, spoofing scans with the ID tags and apparent hull type of
    any other ship of its choice. To penetrate this masquerade, the
    scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program skill check against
    difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking ship's comms
    officer. Once the ship is close enough to visually identify, the
    masking is useless.

-   ***<a id="org030f2a2"></a>:*** These sophisticated docking bays provide all the
    necessary tools and support for launching a starship from the mother
    craft. They are rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class
    carriers, but some cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class
    attack shuttle. Each bay allows room for one ship of the appropriate
    hull class. While the carried ship can support its own crew if
    necessary, most carriers fold their space wing into the mothership's
    crew roster. This fitting can be taken multiple times.

-   ***<a id="org295de8f"></a>:*** Much like an armory, this option allows a captain
    to lay in a general supply of equipment likely to be useful to
    explorers and spacemen. Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be
    found in the ship's locker in amounts commensurate with the ship's
    size. A few guns and some basic armor might be included as well, but
    for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear
    available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it
    away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is
    restocked.

-   ***<a id="org118f1c5"></a>:*** The ship is designed with symbiosis mounts
    that allow other ships to “hitch” on the craft's spike drills. Each
    shiptender mount allows one craft of a hull size smaller than the
    tender to link up for intersystem drills. Mounts cannot be used for
    in-system travel. If the linking ship has been designed to be
    carried by a tender then establishing this link takes one hour. If
    not, it takes a full day to fit the ship into the mount. Ships can
    dismount from the tender with an hour's disentanglement. In an
    emergency, the carried ships can dismount instantly, but the
    mountings are considered disabled then until repairs are
    made. Carried ships cannot fight.

-   ***<a id="orgc064e1a"></a>:*** Carefully-designed storage space intended to
    conceal illicit cargo from customs inspection. Each installation of
    this fitting adds 200 kilograms of cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons
    in a frigate, 20 tons in a cruiser, or 200 tons in a capital
    ship. Cargo in a smuggler's hold will never be found by a standard
    customs inspection. Careful investigation by a suspicious official
    can find it on a difficulty 10 check using their Wis/Notice skill,
    and a week-long search one step short of disassembly will find it on
    a difficulty 7 check.

-   ***<a id="org373d43f"></a>:*** Most ships require only basic analysis of a
    star system, sufficient to identify population centers, do rough
    scanning of an object's composition, and chart major navigational
    hazards. Survey sensor arrays greatly enhance the ship's sensor
    abilities, allowing for finely-detailed mapping of objects and
    planets, along with broad-spectrum communications analysis. They
    also improve attempts to detect other craft when scanning a region
    for stealthy vessels. Any rolls with survey sensor arrays add +2 to
    skill checks.

-   ***<a id="orga231ecd"></a>:*** The ship's standard drive-1 spike drive is removed
    and replaced with a different propulsion system. The ship is still
    treated as having a drive-1 for maneuvering and system transit
    purposes, but it cannot make interstellar drills. This modification
    lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and adds extra power and
    space based on the size of the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2 for
    frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this
    amount of free mass is gained by the process.

-   ***<a id="org09bed59"></a>:*** This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in
    most sectors and was uncommon even on Mandate-era ships. The pads
    allow up to a dozen people or 1,200 kilograms of matter to be
    teleported to and from the surface of a planet or the interior of a
    another ship, provided it is no more than a few tens of thousands of
    kilometers distant. Ship-toship teleportation is possible only when
    the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting accurate
    coordinate details; otherwise, a friendly, unjammed signal from
    inside is necessary to lock onto the target point. Planetary
    teleportations are possible only in the absence of physical barriers
    between the ship and the target point below. The teleporters may be
    used once every five minutes. In those rare sectors where this tech
    is widely available, it costs 200k.

-   ***<a id="org3f4d882"></a>:*** Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate
    objects within its immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding
    objects no larger than a ship of one hull class smaller. Targets
    with ship-scale propulsion can resist the beams, but lifeboats,
    individual suit jets, or other smaller propulsors are
    inadequate. The beam can focus on only one object at a time but can
    move it into the ship's cargo bays or hurl it out of the ship's
    immediate vicinity within three rounds. The beams can only
    effectively manipulate objects in very low gravity, and not those on
    the surface of planets or other objects with significant natural
    gravity.

-   ***<a id="org53ec6a3"></a>:*** The ship has been fitted with
    specialized mounts, bunking, cargo bays, and other facilities to
    expedite the transport of often-unwieldy vehicles, including mechs
    and other military craft. Any vehicles carried count as only half
    their usual cargo tonnage. Assuming trained operators, up to four
    vehicles can be offloaded or ramped onto the ship per round in cases
    where speed is critical.

-   ***<a id="org9800ca3"></a>:*** On-board workshops can be bought at smaller than
    maximum sizes than a hull would allow, if additional TL4 tech
    facilities aren't strictly needed. A frigate-sized workshop is
    sufficient for modding any personal gear as per the modification
    rules here. A cruiser-sized workshop handles vehicle modding and
    starship maintenance, and a capital-class workshop can build
    vehicles or similar large work from scratch at full cost. sTarshiP
    defenses The defenses listed here are some of the more common ones
    installed in modern TL4 starships. Most non-warships mount little or
    nothing in the way of special defenses, preferring to save the hull
    space for cargo and immediately useful fittings.

# Starship Defenses

-   ***Ablative Hull Compartments:*** By sacrificing empty hull space in a
    complex system of ablative blast baffles, a capital-class ship can
    have a large amount of its total mass shot away without actually
    impinging on its normal function. This grants it a +1 AC bonus and
    20 extra maximum hit points.

-   ***Augmented Plating:*** At the cost of a certain amount of speed and
    maneuverability, a ship can have its armor plating reinforced
    against glancing hits, gaining a +2 bonus to its AC. This
    augmentation can decrease a ship's Speed below 0, meaning it will be
    applied as a penalty to all Pilot tests.

-   ***Boarding Countermeasures:*** The ship has hardened bulkheads,
    reinforced hatches, and specially-designed automated kill corridors
    for wiping out intruders. Provided that the ship's bridge is still
    under control, the operator can prevent entry to the ship by any
    force that lacks shipyard-grade tools, weapons capable of melting
    hull plating, or specialized military breaching implements. If
    intruders do get inside, only well-equipped, specially-trained
    marines have any real chance of breaching the defenses. Ordinary
    space pirates or more casual invaders have only a 1 in 6 chance of
    threatening the bridge crew, though they may cause significant
    damage in their dying.

-   ***Burst ECM Generator:*** A high-powered secondary ECM generator can
    be activated to negate any one otherwise-successful hit against the
    ship. This generator can be activated after the damage has been
    rolled, but enemy ships rapidly compensate for the new ECM source,
    and so the generator can only be used effectively once per
    engagement.

-   ***Foxer Drones:*** These drones are invariably shortlived due to the
    enormous energy signatures they produce, but until the ship's next
    turn they grant a +2 AC bonus as their emissions confuse foes. Foxer
    drones are cheaply constructed and essentially free; the only limit
    on their number is the amount of free space set aside for holding
    them.

-   ***Grav Eddy Displacer:*** This system links with a ship's
    navigational subsystem and randomizes the motion vectors in sympathy
    with metadimensional gravitic currents. This agility gives any hit
    on the ship a 1 in 6 chance of being negated entirely.

-   ***Hardened Polyceramic Overlay:*** A complex glazing process can
    harden the surface of a ship's armor to more effectively shed
    incoming attacks, decreasing the armor-piercing quality of any hit
    by 5.

    cruisers, and 100 for capital-class hulls*
-   \# / These costs are multiplied by 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers,
    and 4 for capital hulls./

-   ***Planetary Defense Array:*** The ship is equipped with an array of
    gravitic braker guns and an upgraded nuke snuffer field. While
    useless in conventional ship-to-ship combat, the array can deflect
    or dampen meteor impacts, dropped penetrator rods, or other
    non-powered bombardment techniques, and the snuffer field is
    powerful enough to prevent nuclear fission reactions over a
    hemisphere-sized area. A single ship with a PDA can protect against
    any natural meteor strikes and deny easy terror bombardment of a
    planet's population. The PDA cannot fully protect against orbital
    strikes by powered penetrators, but it can nudge them off course and
    make pinpoint strikes impractical. Most developed planets have much
    more powerful and effective ground installations, but a PDA-equipped
    ship is a useful emergency stopgap for poor or primitive worlds.

-   ***Point Defense Lasers:*** Too small to damage ships, these point
    defense lasers can detonate or melt incoming munitions, improving
    the ship's defenses against torpedoes, fractal impact charges, and
    other ammunition-based weapons.


<a id="starship-weaponry"></a>

# Starship Weaponry

Space is dangerous, and most ships mount the best weapons their purse
and their ship's infrastructure can support. While most worlds limit
the purchase of warships by civilians, few place restraints on the
type of weapons a civilian ship can mount.

Ship weaponry tends to come in two classes. One class of weapon is
damaging and has moderate power and mass demands, but has
comparatively weak armor-piercing capabilities. Another class of
weapon is expensive, taxing to a ship's systems, and may have somewhat
inferior damage, but it has enough armor-piercing to affect a warship
of a hull size one step larger than the mounting starship.

The choice of which class of weapon to mount usually depends on the
type of opposition the designer expects the ship to face. Most
civilian ships favor the former kind, as few expect to engage true
warships.


<a id="weapon-qualities"></a>

## Weapon Qualities

-   ***Ammo:*** The weapon or defense requires ammunition to fire. Each
    round's cost is listed after the weapon's cost, and a number of
    rounds equal to the weapon's Ammo rating can be fit into one free
    mass unit. For example, a torpedo launcher can fit the magazine and
    loading gear for four torpedoes into one free mass unit, and each
    torpedo will cost 2,500 credits. For each ship class larger than the
    minimum required to mount the weapon, double the stored ammo per
    unit. The weapon itself includes one free mass unit worth of
    ammunition as part of the installation, so simply mounting a torpedo
    launcher alone on a frigate gives the ship four rounds of ammo.

-   ***AP:*** The weapon ignores this many points of a target's armor. The
    *Hardened Polyceramic Overlay* defense upgrade may lessen the
    effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon's AP rating can do
    is reduce a target's effective armor to zero. It cannot add
    additional damage to a hit.

-   ***Cloud:*** The weapon fires an omni-directional wave or spray of
    projectiles. It automatically targets all fighter-class ships that
    have attacked the ship within the past round, and the gunner may
    make one attack roll against each target. Cloud weapons have no
    effect on ships larger than fighter-class hulls or intruders who are
    actually on the hull.

-   ***Clumsy:*** Either through a slow discharge time or unwieldy
    engineering requirements, this weapon suffers -4 to hit small
    fighter-class hulls.

-   ***Flak:*** These weapons launch vast numbers of small energy
    discharges or projectiles, and are particularly dangerous to small
    ships that rely on speed over thick armor. Against fighter-class
    hulls, these weapons roll hit rolls and damage rolls twice and take
    the better result.


<a id="weapon-descriptions"></a>

## Weapon Descriptions

Each weapon listed below has a cost, the damage die it uses on a hit,
and the amount of hardpoints, free power, and mass it takes up in a
hull. The minimum hull class required to mount it is also listed, as
is the minimum tech level to manufacture it.

All ship weapon attack and damage rolls use the better of the gunner's
Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. Most use Shoot as the relevant
skill, though Pilot can be used for the guns of a fighter-class ship.

-   ***Multifocal Laser:*** Twinned assay and penetration lasers modulate
    the frequency of this beam for remarkable armor penetration. These
    weapons are popular choices for fighters intended for frigate or
    cruiser engagement.

-   ***Reaper Battery:*** Stepped tapping of the spike drive power plant
    allows for the emission of a torrent of charged particles. The
    particles have very little armor penetration, but can fry a small
    ship's power grid in a strike or two.

-   ***Fractal Impact Charge:*** A spray of penetrator sabots that use
    fractal surfacing to increase impact. Favored for bomber-class
    fighter hulls.

-   ***Polyspectral MES Beam:*** A rare example of pretech weaponry, a
    fighter equipped with a PMB can scratch even a battleship's hull.

-   ***Sandthrower:*** Projecting a spray of tiny, dense particulate
    matter, sandthrowers are highly effective against lightly-armored
    fighters.

-   ***Flak Emitter Battery:*** A baseline frigate anti-fighter system,
    this battery fires waves of lasers or charged particles to knock
    down small craft.


<a id="sidebar-ground-weapons-vs-ships"></a>

## Ground Weapons vs. Ships

On rare occasions, PCs will have to deal with small arms fire against
their spaceship, or evade ground guns when trying to escape a port or
land safely on a hostile world.

As a basic rule of thumb, hostile TL3 small arms fire does no damage,
TL4 small arms fire does 1d6 damage per ten minutes of persistent
gunfire, and Heavy weapons do half their rolled damage, minus the
ship's Armor. Multiple Heavy weapons blazing away at a grounded free
merchant can reduce it to unflyable scrap in short order, but a
peppering of mag rifle fire is unlikely to do serious damage to a ship
that decamps with sufficient speed.

It is impossible to miss a grounded ship. The Armor Class of a ship in
flight will vary with the situation; AC 10 for hovering nearby, AC 15
for close-to-earth flight, and AC 20 if the ship is simply flying
within weapon range.

Active ground-placed anti-ship defenses are a different matter. These
massive lasers and energy projectors are absolutely lethal at
atmospheric ranges. Avoiding them is a Pilot skill check at a
GM-chosen difficulty of 8 to 10 for each round the ship is exposed,
suffering 2d10 damage with AP 20 on each miss. A desperate ship can
get outside the gun's firing angle if it can survive three rounds of
this peril.

-   ***Torpedo Launcher:*** Capable of damaging even a battleship,
    torpedoes are cumbersome, expensive, and often the core of a line
    frigate's armament.

-   ***Charged Particle Caster:*** A focalized upgrade to the reaper
    battery, the CPC has a much better armor penetration profile.

-   ***Plasma Beam:*** With superior targeting and a smaller energy drain
    than a CPC, a plasma beam sacrifices some armor penetration.

-   ***Mag Spike Array:*** A storm of magnetically-accelerated spike
    charges is almost guaranteed to eradicate any fighter-class craft it
    hits.

-   ***Nuclear Missiles:*** Useless in ship-to-ship combat or against any
    other TL4 planet with working nuke snuffers, one of these missiles
    can still erase an entire lostworlder city without such protection.

-   ***Spinal Beam Cannon:*** One of the first spinal-mount class weapons,
    the SBC briefly channels the full power of the ship into a charged
    beam. It lacks the power and penetration of the more advanced
    gravcannon, but also takes less power to mount.

-   ***Smart Cloud:*** A swarm of self-directed microdrones sweeps over
    the ship. Their integral beam weaponry is too small to damage larger
    ships, but they can wipe out an attacking fighter wave.

-   ***Gravcannon:*** Using much the same principles as man-portable grav
    weaponry, the gravcannon causes targets to fall apart in a welter of
    mutually-antagonistic gravitic fields.

-   ***Spike Inversion Projector:*** The SIP uses the ship's spike phasing
    as an offensive weapon, penetrating the target with a brief
    incursion of MES energies that largely ignore attempts to evade.

-   ***Vortex Tunnel Inductor:*** A capital-class model of the SIP, a VTI
    is capable of incapacitating a cruiser in two hits. Its bulk limits
    its utility against fighter-class craft, however.

-   ***Mass Cannon:*** By firing projectiles almost as large as
    fighter-scale craft, the mass cannon inflicts tremendous damage on a
    target. Serious ammunition limitations hamper its wider-scale use.

-   ***Lightning Charge Mantle:*** Modulation of the ship's power core
    emits a cloak of MES lightning. While larger spike drive craft can
    shunt the energies away harmlessly, fighter-class ships are almost
    invariably destroyed if hit.

-   ***Singularity Gun:*** One of the few surviving pretech weapons in
    anything resembling wide currency, this capital-class weapons system
    fires something mathematically related to a miniaturized black hole
    at a target.

## Example Starships

Below are the final statistics for some of the more common starship
models in post-Silence human space. Each entry includes the default
NPC crew skill modifier and the normal number of Command Points each
one gets each round under NPC crews.

Costs are listed for the ship itself, for its six month maintenance,
and for the yearly employment of its standard crew complement. PCs
naturally need not draw this pay, though they'll still need to lay out
20 credits a day per head for food and other basic supplies.


<a id="example-strike-fighter"></a>

### Strike Fighter

-   HP: 8
-   Power: 5/1 free
-   AC: 16
-   Mass: 2/0 free
-   Armor: 5
-   Crew: 1/1
-   Speed: 5
-   Hull Class: Fighter
-   Crew Skill: +2 NPC
-   CP: 4
-   Weapons:
    Reaper Battery (+4/3d4, Clumsy)
-   Defenses:
    None
-   Fittings:
    Spike Drive-1
    Atmospheric Configuration
-   Cost:
    305K base price
    15,250 maintenance
    43,800 yearly crew cost for 1 pilot

The standard drill-capable fighter craft of most TL4 polities, this
model retains a spike drive instead of replacing it with a cheaper
systems drive. While the lone pilot would have to be desperate and
heavily drugged to make an entire spike drill solo, it remains an
option when no larger craft is available.

This particular model is equipped with a reaper battery for dealing
with small, lightly-armored civilian ships. “Bomber”-type fighters
usually replace this with a fractal impact charge to threaten larger
warships, while fighters built to dogfight their peers favor fitting a
multifocal laser.


<a id="example-shuttle"></a>

### Shuttle

-   HP: 15
-   Power: 3/2 free
-   AC: 11
-   Mass: 5/0 free
-   Armor: 0 Crew: 1/20
-   Hull Class: Fighter
-   Speed: 3
-   Crew Skill: +1 NPC
-   CP: 4
-   Weapons:
    None
-   Defenses:
    None
-   Fittings:
    Spike Drive-1
    Atmospheric Configuration
    Extended Life Support
    6 tons cargo
-   Cost:
    210K base price
    10,500 maintenance
    43,800 yearly crew cost for 1 pilot

This craft is a conventional civilian shuttle, albeit one with a spike
drive sufficient to get it to a neighboring system and enough
passenger space to make it a minimally-acceptable transport for brave
VIPs and light cargo. If used as an inter-system transport, however,
at least three crew will be needed to safely navigate a drill.

While cheap and flexible, the shuttle is entirely unarmed and acutely
vulnerable to piracy or hostile warships. In such cases the pilot's
only recourse is to surrender or hope the small craft's nimble
maneuver drives can keep it away from the attacker long enough to get
to safety.


<a id="example-free-merchant"></a>

### Free Merchant

-   HP: 20
-   Power: 10/0 free
-   AC: 14
-   Mass: 15/0 free
-   Armor: 2
-   Crew: 1/6
-   Speed: 3
-   Hull Class: Frigate
-   Crew Skill: +1 NPC
-   CP: 4
-   Weapons:
    Multifocal Laser (+3/1d4, AP 20)
    Sandthrower (+3/2d4, Flak)
-   Defenses: None
-   Fittings:
    Spike Drive-1
    160 tons of cargo space
    Atmospheric Configuration
    Fuel Scoops
    Fuel Bunker
-   Cost:
    775K base price
    38,750 maintenance
    131,400 yearly crew cost for 3 crew

A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space,
the standard free merchant A mainstay of freebooting
merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the standard free
merchant is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling
significant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while requiring
very few hands to operate it. Only one crew member is needed for
in-system flight, though spike drills require three for normal margins
of safety.

The standard free merchant is not a warship, but its sandthrower is
enough to discourage pirate shuttles and the other small or fragile
craft that wreckers or primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal
laser is ideal for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out important
systems on an attacking vessel, but the ship lacks the armor and
durability to stand up to a true warship. Of course, with a
sufficiently expert crew, even a corvette might be threatened by the
wellaimed guns of a small craft like this.


<a id="example-patrol-boat"></a>

### Patrol Boat

-   HP: 25
-   Power: 15/1 free
-   AC: 14
-   Mass: 10/0 free
-   Armor: 5
-   Crew: 5/20
-   Speed: 4
-   Hull Class: Frigate
-   Crew Skill: +2 NPC
-   CP: 5
-   Weapons:
    Plasma Beam (+4/3d6, AP 10)
-   Defenses:
    None
-   Fittings:
    Spike Drive-2
    Atmospheric Configuration
    Extended Stores
    Boarding Tubes
    Armory
    Ship's Locker
    Survey Sensors
-   Cost:
    3.523M base price
    176K maintenance
    657K yearly crew cost for 15 crew

Patrol boats are often the largest ships fielded by poor or backward
frontier worlds that lack the shipyard facilities or available
resources to build bigger military craft. Even so, the ability to
field two patrol boats for the yearly maintenance cost of one corvette
often appeals even to richer worlds that need more coverage than their
available craft can provide.

Patrol boats are the smallest independent warships fielded by most
navies, as fighters are not normally considered capable of extended
independent operation.

They have considerable spike drive reach and are faster in-system than
most of their potential targets. While their single mounted gun is
vulnerable to being disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively
thick armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can mitigate
that danger. A few patrol boats replace their survey sensor array with
a sandthrower to up-gun the ship, but most prefer the additional edge
in scanning potential smugglers.


<a id="example-corvette"></a>

### Corvette

-   HP: 40
-   Power: 15/0 free
-   AC: 13
-   Mass: 15/0 free
-   Armor: 10
-   Crew: 10/40
-   Speed: 2
-   Hull Class: Frigate
-   Crew Skill: +2 NPC
-   CP: 5
-   Weapons:
    2 Plasma Beams (+4/3d6, AP 10)
    Sandthrower (+4/2d4, Flak)
-   Defenses:
    Hardened Polyceramic Overlay
-   Fittings:
    Spike Drive-2
    Cargo Lighter
    Extended Stores
    Boarding Tubes
    Armory
    Ship's Locker
    Fuel Bunker
-   Cost:
    5.973M base price
    298K maintenance
    1.314M yearly crew cost for 30 crew

The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded frontier navies, a
corvette is a true warship, albeit of a minimal size. While it is
unable to land on worlds with standard gravity, its cargo lighter
allows crew and cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its
extended stores allow for more than four months of field operation
under normal crew parameters.

Most pirates flying reworked free merchants or stolen patrol boats
will turn tail as soon as a corvette shows up in the region. Good
armor, multiple ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make a
corvette a death sentence to most stellar ruffians, and even when a
pirate wolf pack can bring one down, it usually comes at the cost of
crippling damage.

The model depicted here is standard for anti-piracy and basic system
defense missions. Against cruiser-class warships, however, this
corvette's weapons have insufficient armor penetration to seriously
threaten such a major warship.


<a id="example-heavy-frigate"></a>

### Heavy Frigate

-   HP: 50
-   Power: 25/0 free
-   AC: 15
-   Mass: 20/0 free
-   Armor: 10
-   Crew: 30/120
-   Speed: 1
-   Hull Class: Frigate
-   Crew Skill: +2 NPC
-   CP: 5
-   Weapons:
    2 Plasma Beams (+4/3d6, AP 10)
    16 Torpedoes (+4/3d8, AP 20, Ammo 4)
-   Defenses:
    Hardened Polyceramic Overlay
-   Fittings:
    Spike Drive-2
    Drop Pod
    Fuel Scoops
    Fuel Bunker
    Armory Ship's Locker
    Boarding Tubes
-   Cost:
    9.783M base price
    489K maintenance
    3.942M yearly crew cost for 90 crew

Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavy frigate pushes
the engineering parameters of a frigate hull to the maximum available
to most TL4 worlds. Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of
threatening even cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate can
intimidate any ship of its weight class. Its heavy crew complement and
military drop pod fitting allow it to quickly dispatch well-armed
marines to hot spots throughout a solar system.

However, despite the large weapon loadout, the heavy frigate remains a
frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true
cruiser-class warship, and most frigates built for same-class
engagements can be a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as
a bludgeon against the other small warships likely to be fielded by a
peer star-faring polity.

Found only in rich, peaceful regions of space, the bulk freighter is
capable of hauling thousands of tons of goods between star
systems. While it's equipped with enough of a sting to discourage
small-ship piracy, it's woefully inadequate to handle a warship, or
even an up-gunned free merchant.

Some adventurers do find use for a bulk freighter hull, however,
trading off some of its massive cargo space for more fittings and
using customized modifications to allow the ship to support heavier
power demands. While the end result is no match for a true cruiser,
the sheer mass of the freighter can make it a dangerous opponent in
the right hands.

The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the fleet cruiser is
a ship-eating monster compared to its smaller brethren in the
navy. Only prosperous polities can build such powerful ships, and even
they sometimes find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of
small craft rather than a few heavily-armed cruisers.

The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily-armored
hull. Only special hunter-killer ships fitted with armor-piercing
weaponry have any real chance of penetrating the cruiser's thick
skin. Those weapons are almost always more bulky and power-hungry than
their peer weapons, so enemy polities must usually choose between
building small ships that are very effective at defeating other small
ships, or building hunter-killers that can threaten cruisers but are
at a disadvantage against their less specialized brethren.

Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can create, only
the richest modern worlds can afford to fabricate these massive
engines of war. Even those worlds with adequate resources to do so
often balk at expending such a tremendous amount of money on a single
ship.

Those that do build battleships do so for a reason. The tremendous
weight of fire these ships put out can pop a cruiser in a single
firing pass, and its reinforced hull plating shrugs off all but the
heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require
hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require
hunter-killer *cruisers* to disable them.

The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it is only a single
ship&#x2026; a single, *extremely expensive* ship. It can only attack or
defend a single location at a time, and an enemy that has the time and
resources to build specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and
expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far less money than
it cost to build it.

The queen of every navy that has one, a carrier is the pinnacle of TL4
shipbuilding technology and a massive credit sink for any polity rich
or desperate enough to build one. Every fully-equipped carrier holds
more firepower than most modern navies can assemble, and a single
carrier is more than enough to crush most TL4 naval task forces.

The carrier itself is only the vector for its tremendous payload of
ships, both small fighters and corvette-type daughter craft. The
ability to quickly alter the flight wings of a carrier allows a rich
planet to tailor its loadout to the specific needs of a campaign,
whether it's destroying the interstellar commerce and asteroid mines
of an enemy polity or going head-to-head against their cruiser line of
battle. Many polities further optimize their carrier-loaded ships by
removing their spike drives and replacing them with system drives,
relying on the carrier to get them into position. Of course, if the
mothership is destroyed in hostile territory, these orphans are
doomed.

While a carrier has a belly full of death, the ship itself is lightly
gunned and has significantly weaker armor than its battleship
brethren. Any polity rich enough to build a carrier knows well enough
to equip it with an escort of other ships to screen it from hostile
attentions. Lightly-armed as it is, a wing of fighter-bombers can
leave it a burning hulk if it's caught out without protection.

# Building a Ship

A fortunate adventurer has won the favor of a powerful shipping magnate,
and has earned one million credits worth of astronautic work. The player
thinks it's an excellent chance to have a ship built to fit the
adventuring party's needs.

She starts by looking over the ship hulls and quickly sees that a free
merchant hull is the best she can afford. A shuttle hull might work,
but such a ship is too fragile for her liking. The hull itself costs
500,000 credits and comes with a drive-1 spike drive.

It also has free Power and Mass scores of 10 and 15 respectively. The
player can fill that space with fittings and defenses as she wishes.

First, she looks at weaponry. She wants enough firepower to discourage
small ships, but she can't mount weapons that require a cruiser or
capital hull, and a plasma beam is far too expensive. She could settle
for a multifocal laser, which is cheap, but she decides to up-gun to a
fractal impact charge, trusting in the party's Warrior to aim it
well. It costs 200k credits, 5 power, 1 mass, and 1 free hardpoint. It
can store up to 8 charges in the launcher since a frigate-class hull
is one larger than the minimum needed to mount it. The charges
themselves will cost her another 4,000 credits.

Next, she thinks about better engines. She briefly considers a drive-3
upgrade, but it would take 4 points of Power and Mass, leaving her
almost no Power left for other fittings. She settles for a drive-2
upgrade for 100k credits, 2 Power, and 2 Mass.

She takes a moment to think about adding some hardened polyceramic
overlay to the merchant as a defense, but the ship's Armor is so low
that it doesn't seem worth the effort to harden it.

The PCs will need to land, so she adds an atmospheric configuration at
50k and 2 Mass. She wants fuel scoops so she doesn't have to trust to
local refueling stations, so that's 50k, 2 Power, and 2 Mass. Prudence
recommends a fuel bunker in case she needs to drill out before
refueling, adding 25k and 1 Mass.

She's so far spent 929,000 credits, 9 Power, and 8 Mass. To spare
bookkeeping, she puts in a ship's locker for 25k, but an armory is too
expensive; the PCs will just have to track their own weapons and
ammo. The remaining Mass is turned into 140 tons of cargo space. Thus,
the final ship costs 954,000 credits and uses 9 Power, and 15 Mass. At
a rate of 25,000 credits of shipyard work a day, it'll take the yards
about 39 days to build, giving the party time to think about how
they'll pay for maintenance&#x2026;


<a id="modifying-and-tuning-starships"></a>

## Modifying and Tuning Starships

Most ships are maintained in the condition they came from the
shipyard, with the crew and the engineers working to keep things
aligned with the shipwright's specifications. Such rigid conformity
with standard techniques ensures easy repair, cheap maintenance, and
the ready ability to switch crews without requiring laborious
retraining or familiarization. Not all engineers value these qualities
so highly, however, and some prefer to install their own improvements.

A ship's engineer can alter the wiring, internal structure, or other
specifications of a starship, either to improve overall performance or
make tradeoffs that are useful to their needs. Making these
modifications isn't cheap, and they often require the strategic
deployment of rare pretech ship components.

Engineers with sufficiently vast resources, shipyard access, and
available pretech components can completely re-engineer a ship to
integrate their improvements in the basic hull structure. These
improvements no longer require their special attention to keep them
operational, allowing the engineer to focus on other modifications or
allow less talented crewmen to keep the ship in fighting trim.


<a id="mods-and-maintenance-1"></a>

## Mods and Maintenance

Every engineer has a Maintenance score, the same used for installing
equipment mods as described here. The score is equal to their
Intelligence modifier plus their Constitution modifier plus three
times their Fix score. Any mod maintenance is counted against this
Maintenance score, whether for equipment or starships.

An engineer can maintain a number of mods at once equal to their
Maintenance score. If a ship mod is neglected for one week of active
use, it breaks down. Any fittings or functions dependent on the mod
also become inoperable until a sufficiently skilled engineer spends at
least 8 hours repairing the mod, a process which requires time but no
significant additional parts. Ships parked at a station or landing
strip don't count as “active” for this purpose, so the ship's engineer
can go off for a week's adventure or shore leave without returning to
a broken-down starship.

More than one engineer can work to maintain a ship's modifications,
provided the maintenance officer has a Fix skill score as high as that
needed to install the mod in the first place. This also assumes that
the chief engineer and any assistants work together closely to
properly teach the structure and quirks of the modification. The
difficulty of maintaining this close teamwork and sourcing exotic
parts to maintain a non-standard modification is one reason why very
few NPC ships have mods. While they're possible for elite craft and
idiosyncratic prototypes, most military ships or corporate traders
have too much of a logistical burden to support these odd alterations.


<a id="installing-mods-1"></a>

## Installing Mods

Every starship mod requires a certain amount of refitting work and
after-market parts, along with a potential need for one or more
pretech components. These pretech components are not normally for
sale, and are usually found only through salvage during adventuring or
as rewards for favors performed for important personages. While they
vary in structure and appearance, for convenience's sake it's assumed
that a given component can serve in installing any mod.

Building the mod can be done at a rate of one day's work for the crew
per 5,000 credits in mod cost, or one day per 25,000 credits if a
shipyard's services are available. Mods can also be torn out, a
process taking less than a day that reclaims any pretech components
used in their construction but wastes any credit investment in parts.

Mod installation does not require a full shipyard, but it does assume
the full crew of the ship is assisting the engineer in stripping
components, welding in new fittings, and hauling heavy parts. A lone
engineer can't make mods to anything larger than a frigate-class hull,
and that might take a week's painstaking labor for every 5,000 credits
of cost.


<a id="redesigning-ships"></a>

## Redesigning Ships

An engineer with vast amounts of money, components, and shipyard
support can completely rebuild a ship hull to include a mod as part of
its basic structure, or redesign an existing hull schematic to include
the mod. This is much more expensive than a quick after-market
addition, but the mod becomes part of the basic ship itself and
requires no further Maintenance.

To rebuild a ship with a mod, the engineer must spend five times the
usual cost in credits and twice as many pretech components as usually
required by the mod. A shipyard is mandatory for such extensive
redesign, and can do the work at a rate of 25,000 credits worth each
day.

To build an entirely new hull that includes the mod as part of its
design, only the normal price of the mod must be paid in credits and
components. By integrating the modification into the ship's basic
blueprints, the engineer makes it much easier to install and maintain
it. Of course, the entire hull must then be built from scratch at a
shipyard, also at the usual rate of 25,000 credits of work done per
day.

There's a limit to the amount of flexibility an engineer has in such
designs, however. A ship can only be rebuilt or redesigned with a
number of mods equal to twice the engineer's Fix skill score. Further
mods can be bolted on afterwards, but these will require Maintenance
to keep in operating order, just as with any other mod.


<a id="example-starship-mods"></a>

## Example Starship Mods

The following modifications aren't the only alterations that a canny
engineer can install on a starship, but they're among the most common.
Each one is listed with the minimum Fix skill required to install or
maintain the mod.

The credit price for most is expressed in a percent of the base hull
cost; thus, to install a power trunk streamlining mod with a 10% cost
in a free merchant hull would cost 50,000 credits, or 10% the cost of
the base hull. In a battleship hull, that same mod would cost
6,000,000 credits.

The pretech component cost is given in components per hull
class. Thus, if a mod requires one component per hull class, it would
take one component for a fighter-class hull, two for a frigate, three
for a cruiser, and four for a capital-class hull. These pretech
components are usually rare and restricted enough that they cannot be
purchased on the open market. PCs need to find them during their
adventures, acquire them through favors to powerful persons, or
intentionally seek them out in salvage adventures.

Most mods can be installed only once, though a few of them labeled
otherwise can be duplicated as far as the ship's infrastructure can
support them.

-   ***<a id="orgf69d977"></a> (Fix-1):*** The ship's internal structure is
    adjusted to optimize available cargo space. The ship's total free
    Mass is decreased by 10%, rounded up, but, each point of Mass
    dedicated to cargo space counts as two points. Cost: 10% of hull, 1
    component/hull class

-   ***<a id="org909bea9"></a> (Fix-1):*** The ship can carry twice as much
    ammunition as its available weapons and magazine space would
    normally allow. Cost: 5% of hull, no components

-   ***<a id="orge22d2bd"></a> (Fix-2):*** The ship's spike drive is
    counted as one level better when determining spike drill transit
    speed and maximum drill range, up to a maximum of drive-6. Cost: 10%

    increases the difficulty of any spike drive skill check by +2 if
    in-system or +4 if actually landed. Drilling out from the surface
    will destroy everything within 200 meters of the ship. The mod can
    be used only once every four weeks. Cost: 20% hull, 2
    components/hull class

    realspace maneuverability. The ship's Speed increases by 1. Cost:
    10% of hull, 1 component/hull class

-   ***<a id="orgd7d69ed"></a> (Fix-2):*** The ship's fuel tanks are replaced with
    effectively everlasting pretech energy cores. It no longer needs to
    refuel for drills or operation. Cost: 5% of hull, 2 components/hull
    class

-   ***<a id="org7759fe4"></a> (Fix-1):*** The engineer trims back the power
    core to allow for more ship mass. Lose up to ten points of free
    Power; gain half as many points of free Mass, rounded down. This mod
    can be installed multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one component

-   ***<a id="org2b89a22"></a> (Fix-1):*** Any sensor checks to detect the ship have
    their difficulty increased by +2. Cost: 10% of hull, 1
    component/hull class

-   ***<a id="org899ae64"></a> (Fix-3):*** The ship's targeting computers are
    augmented with pretech prediction software. Once per ship combat, a
    gunner on the ship can take an Instant action to cause a weapon shot
    to hit, regardless of the hit roll. Cost: 5% of hull, 2
    components/hull class

-   ***<a id="orgcb96ce4"></a> (Fix-2):*** Choose a specific weapon or fitting
    that normally requires a hull size one step larger than the ship the
    mod is installed on. The ship can mount that fitting. Cost: 15% of
    hull, 1 component/hull size

-   ***<a id="org3c8b746"></a> (Fix-1):*** Sacrifice free hull space for
    superior power core efficiency. Lose up to five points of free Mass;

    multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one component

-   ***<a id="orgc4191d7"></a> (Fix-1):*** Some or all of ship's weapons are
    concealed from external observation and standard scans when they are
    not deployed for combat. The ship itself can be made to look like a
    merchant or freighter of its size class. Cost: 5% of hull, no
    components

-   ***<a id="org6466fb2"></a> (Fix-3):*** The ship's Armor score increases by
    5 points. Cost: 15% of hull, 2 components/hull class

-   ***<a id="org6a0598d"></a> (Fix-1):*** The ship's Armor score increases by
    the Fix skill of the installing engineer. The ship loses one point
    of Power and one point of Mass. Cost: 5% of hull

-   ***<a id="orgecb99a4"></a> (Fix-1):*** Choose a specific weapon or
    fitting when this mod is installed. The chosen fitting requires only
    half the normal Power and Mass per fitting installation, rounded
    down to a minimum of 1. Cost: 10% of hull, no components

-   ***<a id="org23ca55d"></a> (Fix-2):*** The ship's weaponry has been altered
    for rapid firing. Once per combat, the ship's gunner gets 4 Command
    Points that must be spent on gunnery actions. Cost: 10% of hull, no
    components

-   ***<a id="org47a461c"></a> (Fix-2):*** One weapon of the engineer's choice
    has been overcharged. It requires 50% more Power than a usual
    installation, but rolls its damage twice and takes the better result
    each time. This mod may be installed more than once. Cost: 5% of
    hull, no components

# Space Travel

Interstellar travel takes place through metadimensional space, a
higher-order continuum “understood” by only a handful of brilliant
researchers and astronautic engineers. Fortunately, it is not
necessary to have an intuitive understanding of the place in order to
operate a spike drive starship. While modern postech spike drives are
neither as powerful nor as efficient as the exquisite creations of the
Terran Mandate, most TL4 worlds can still put together the necessary
components to get a ship from one stellar system to another.

Within the gravity well created by a stellar body, a spike drive
provides sub-light propulsion sufficient to get the ship to most
system locations within a few days at most. Only at the edge of a
solar system, where the gravitic influence of the star dwindles away
to almost nothing, can the spike drive be fully engaged to catapult
the ship into metadimensional space. This gravitic transition zone is
critical for providing the necessary step-up and step-down for a spike
drive. Without such a transition, a ship can neither climb into
metadimensional space nor come down from those elevated dimensional
frequencies. Only a star is sufficient to provide enough of a gravitic
gradient; random interstellar rocks and debris don't exert enough of
an influence to form a usable transition zone.

Ships are generally unable to “overshoot” a transition zone. If a ship
is coming into a system from a spike drive course to the stellar
northwest of the star, it will appear at the northwest edge of the
solar system. Its pilot can't choose to “overshoot” that region,
traveling across the solar system to come down on the southeastern
edge of the star's transition zone. This property allows a solar
system's owner to fortify probable transit paths into the system,
placing defenses and picket ships in the path of likely arrivals.

This can be a difficult and expensive process if the star is in a
crowded stellar neighborhood. The transit paths from each potential
destination are different; if a star has two other systems to its
east, it has to fortify two different arrival zones if it wants to be
confident of detecting incoming ships from both stars. If an
exceptionally powerful spike drive allows an intruder to drill in from
a more-distant star, the local polity might have no local sensors at
all in the region, having never anticipated that a ship might come
directly from such a distant location.

These relatively-fixed arrival zones only apply to ships arriving at a
star. A ship can *leave* from any location on the rim, traveling
toward any destination within reach of its spike drive. Thus, a ship
that's able to skulk past a system's frontier sensors can usually find
an empty region of space in the transition zone to skip out
undetected. It also has no obligation to be on the “correct side” of
the star to go leaping off toward a particular stellar destination.


<a id="making-spike-drills"></a>

## Making Spike Drills

Interstellar spike drills are dangerous. Some sectors have the
technology and friendly-enough metadimensional weather to make
standard drill paths relatively safe for travel. Ships in these
favored sectors can move between connected worlds with no significant
chance of disaster. Other sectors are not so fortunate, nor are those
ships that must forge through uncharted metadimensional space to reach
their destination. Careless navigation or sheer bad luck can result in
these ships being snuffed out by an unexpected surge of
metadimensional energy or lost in the storms of hyperdimensional
space.

To make a successful spike drill, the target system must be within
range. A spike drive has a hex range equal to its rating; a drive-3
can reach a star three hexes away on the sector map. Note that these
sector maps are abstractions rather than strict 2D maps. A star three
hexes away might be a vast distance away, but connected by a friendly
stretch of metadimensional space. Conversely, an “empty” adjacent hex
might have a star in it, but it's surrounded by killing waves of
impenetrable dimensional disruption. Because of this, conventional
astronomical mapping isn't overly useful to transit. The astronomers
might know that there's a star only a few light years away, but if the
navigators can't find a metadimensional path to it, it might as well
be on the far side of the galaxy.

A spike drill requires one load of fuel. Most ships can hold a single
load of fuel at any one time. All can be refueled from the appropriate
refineries or starport tending services, while others can use fuel
scoop fittings to refuel from a star or gas giant. Other ships have
fuel bunkers that can hold more than one load of fuel, for quick
double-drills when speed is vital. Normal intra-system maneuvering
uses no significant amount of fuel, and refueling costs a flat 500
credits per load.

A spike drill requires time. A safe drill procedure requires half an
hour to enter metadimensional space, though this process can be rushed
at greater risk. The transit time is six days per hex traveled,
divided by the spike drill rating. Thus, a drive-3 crossing two hexes
would take four days, while a drive-1 moving to an adjacent hex would
take six days. Daring navigators can “trim the course”, accepting
greater risks in transit in order to increase their effective drive
rating by 1 for purposes of determining the speed of travel, though
this bonus doesn't increase the drive's maximum range.

A spike drill needs a course record, or “rutter” to guide the pilot.
Ideally, this is an up-to-date and recent record of the
metadimensional currents and energetic weather between the origin and
destination of their course, one reported by a recent traveler. The
older and staler the readings of the rutter, the more dangerous the
drill. Most rutters for commonly-traveled routes are freely available,
and significant trade corridors usually have ones only a few days old
available to any pilot making the drill.

Rutters charting heretofore-unknown paths between stars are often kept
jealously secret by their owners, and may require an adventure or a
favor to obtain.

Attempting to drill to a star without any rutter at all is insanely
dangerous, the work of near-suicidal crew of adventurers willing to
risk everything in order to obtain a secret route to some
hopefully-unplundered world. Only a masterful interstellar navigator
has any real hope of surviving such a blind drill.

Finally, a spike drill needs a pilot. Only a human or other
sentient-grade intellect is capable of dealing with the dangerously
unpredictable perils of metadimensional space, as expert systems and
other “dumb” robots simply can't handle the random dangers. Most ships
require at least three crew members to cover all the bridge watches
necessary, though only one of these crew needs to be an actual
pilot. In desperate circumstances, a lone pilot can use drugs to stay
awake for as much as a week in order to single-handedly steer a ship
to its destination.

If all these ingredients are in place and the ship is at the edge of
the solar system, a ship's navigator can make an Int/Pilot skill check
to make a successful spike drill, the process taking 30 minutes. If
rushed, it takes only one ship combat round to execute. The base
difficulty is 7, modified by the available rutter, the distance
drilled, rushed procedures, and whether or not the navigator is
trimming the course to speed up the transit. If the final difficulty
is 6 or less, the drill is too safe and simple to have any risk of
failure.

| Spike Drills                           | Mod |
| :------------------------------------- | :-: |
| Base difficulty for a spike drill      |  7  |
| The course is totally uncharted        | +6  |
| The rutter's more than 5 years old     | +2  |
| The rutter's from 1 to 5 years old     | +1  |
| The rutter's less than a year old      | +0  |
| The rutter's less than a month old     | -2  |
| The drill's distance, per 2 full hexes | +1  |
| Trimming the course                    | +2  |
| The drill activation was rushed        | +2  |

If the roll fails, something has gone wrong on the drill, and a roll
on the failed navigation results are necessary. These mishaps don't
normally result in the summary death of the crew, but they often force
the navigator to make emergency course changes or drill exits that
might leave the ship in a dangerously unfriendly region of space.


<a id="intra-system-travel"></a>

## Intra-System Travel

Traveling inside a solar system is much safer and more rapid than
interstellar travel. Barring unusual perils or mechanical failure,
such journeys can be made without Pilot skill checks or risk of
dramatic mishaps.

For convenience, space within a solar system is broken up in
***regions***. Each region is simply a place of interest within the
system; planets are regions, fortified arrival zones are regions,
particular pirate lairs in the asteroid belts are regions, and so
forth. Any particular place of interest and its satellite areas can be
treated as a single region.

The base travel time for moving inside a region is six hours. Thus, in
six hours a ship could travel from a planetary starport to a site on
the planet's moon, or to a distant science station orbiting around the
planet, or to a distress beacon in space near that world. Any place
within that region can be reached within six hours, or faster at the
GM's discretion.

The base travel time for moving between regions is forty-eight hours.
A ship in orbit around one planet could thus travel to an entirely
different planet, or to the transition zone at the rim of the system,
or to a ship detected deep within system space, or to an asteroid
pirate base, or to any other point of interest in the solar system.

Base travel time is divided by the ship's spike drive rating. Thus, a
ship with drive-3 could reach another region in the system in only 16
hours. Bold navigators can “trim the course” to increase their
effective spike drive rating by 1 by making a successful Pilot check
at difficulty 9. On a failure, the travel actually takes twice as long
as usual.

# Sensors and Detection

Adventurers often find it necessary to be very discreet about their
comings and goings within a solar system, as do pirates, hostile
warships, smugglers, and other nefarious sorts. Space is wide and
dark, and if a ship is careful to avoid inhabited regions it can often
escape notice by a system's inhabitants.


<a id="hiding-and-seeking"></a>

## Hiding and Seeking

As a general matter it is very difficult to spot a ship in deep space
when it doesn't wish to be spotted. Once a ship's energy signature is
identified, however, it becomes much easier to follow the ship's
movement; such a positional fix is called a ***detection lock***, and
once a ship has been locked by an observer it can be tracked at any
distance in the system.

Fixing a lock on a target requires the observer to be in the same
region of space and to win an opposed Int/Program skill check against
the ship's comms officer. If the observer wins the opposed roll, they
get a detection lock on the ship. If they lose or tie, they remain
oblivious to the ship's presence and can try again in 24 hours. The
active sensors used to form a detection lock can be detected by the
target; they know they've been made. If the observing ship uses
passive sensors, the lock is undetectable, but it's more difficult to
obtain.

The observer takes bonuses and penalties to their opposed skill check
based on the circumstances as listed below. This can alter their die
roll substantially, and make concealment almost impossible for ships
not specially equipped for stealth. The modifiers below are common
ones, but particular regions of space may have their own hazards or
complications, with some making detection so difficult that they
become favorite lairs for pirates and malcontents.

</table>

The larger the ship, the better the sensors it will have, but the
easier it is to spot it in space. Minor outposts would reflect small
deep-space habs or listening posts, while major space stations would
include most military stations and other significant
fortifications. Ships that carefully avoid population centers when
landing on a world can mitigate some of the danger of a planetary
sensor network, leaving smugglers and pirates to prefer landing in
remote, little-inhabited areas.

To break a lock, a tracked ship needs to leave the region. As soon as
it does, the observer and the ship repeat their opposed skill
check. If the observer wins, it continues to track the ship, while a
tie or loss means the ship slips the lock. Any observers in the
destination region can attempt to pick up the ship immediately and
then once every 24 hours, but the original observer is out of
luck. Provided a ship is willing to escape to the region of deep space
above or below the solar ecliptic, it's extremely unlikely that
there'll be anything there to spot them. Of course, such escape also
means staying clear of potential refuges. A ship that flees to the
“edge of the system” region can drill out to safety from there, and
unless they pick a chunk of the rim monitored by the locals, they can
do so with impunity. Very few worlds can monitor the entire system
perimeter.

When rolling for observation, only roll once for any given group,
outpost, or planet, using the best modifiers available. Thus, if a
battle squadron including a cruiser and three frigates rolls to
observe, the GM would use the skill bonus and +2 modifier for the
cruiser's crew. If a separate pirate ship was in the same region, the
GM would roll for them as well, because they're a separate force in
the region.


<a id="pursuit-and-escape"></a>

## Pursuit and Escape

Adventurers have a habit of drawing unfriendly attention from hostile
ships. While escape from a combat engagement is a matter of maneuver
jets and good piloting, long-range chases rely more on a ship's spike
drives to provide raw motive power.

A pursuer must be in the same region of space to pursue and must have
a detection lock. Of course, if the pursued lacks a detection lock on
the pursuer, they'll have no idea that they're being chased.

Both ships make Int/Pilot opposed skill checks, each adding their
spike drive rating to the roll. If the pursuer wins or ties, they
force an engagement and the ships are moved into combat range. If the
pursued ship wins, it gets six hours of distance, modified by any
difference in spike drive ratings; a drive-1 ship being chased by a
drive-2 ship would have three hours, for example. It can use this time
to reach a particular point inside the region, or can put it toward an
attempt to escape the region entirely. Ships with spike drive-1
engines need 48 hours to enter a new region, so they are unlikely to
avoid a determined pursuer; one with spike drive-3, on the other hand,
can make the escape in only 16 hours. Some pilots may attempt to speed
this up by trimming their course.

A pursuing ship can also use this six hours to aim toward a different
region, if it thinks it knows where the ship is running. Assuming they
can keep the detection lock when the pursued ship slips over the
sub-stellar border, they can end up close on their prey's heels.


<a id="scanning-planets-and-ships"></a>

## Scanning Planets and Ships

Short-range scans of ships and planetary objects are relatively simple
affairs. Any scan of a ship within combat range will reveal the ship's
hull type, obvious weaponry and damage, and registered ID code. A scan
of a planet in orbit will always reveal basic information on
atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, other
ships in orbit, and any surface features designed to attract orbital
interest.

Comms officers can attempt to interrogate the scans, asking one
question before rolling an Int/ Program skill check against
difficulty 8. On a success, the question is answered, while a failure
means that the data is inconclusive and no further questions can be
asked of it that day. Each question after the first success that same
day is asked at a cumulative +1 difficulty modifier. Questions should
be simple and direct.

When scanning a ship, a comms officer might ask whether particular
fittings or weapons have been mounted, where good boarding points
might be on the hull, whether the ship looks to be the product of a
particular world or culture, or simply to question whether anything
looks odd about the ship's readings. The sensors can probe a meter or
so beneath the hull skin, but they can't intrude on a ship's computer
network or provide a map of interior spaces.

When scanning a planet, a comms officer can ask about apparent
capitals or spaceports, major industrial sites, unusual planetary
weather patterns, unique allergens or atmospheric hazards, current
local news transmissions, or identify hidden or low-tech communities
that are large but do not have clear energy signatures.

If they have the *Survey Sensor Array* fitting, they can do orbital
visual spying accurate enough to read newsprint, in addition to asking
questions about subterranean spaces, visible surface life forms of
interest, crude maps of the interior spaces, and interesting energy
readings.


<a id="maintenance-and-repair"></a>

# Maintenance and Repair

Ships are expensive things to keep flying, and many adventuring crews
find themselves taking somewhat dubious work just to get enough money
to keep their ship in the air.


<a id="spares-repairs-and-refueling"></a>

## Spares, Repairs and Refueling

Most ships have their repairs and maintenance done at a shipyard, but
a ship can perform field maintenance and repair if they have the
necessary parts. One ton of cargo space can hold 10,000 credits worth
of spare parts. Any time required is quadrupled, however.

Ship fuel costs a flat 500 credits per load.


<a id="six-month-maintenance"></a>

## Six-Month Maintenance

Every ship needs to spend 5% of its total non-crew cost every six
months in order to pay for basic maintenance. Each such period that is
skipped applies a -1 penalty to all ship skill checks and hit
rolls. At -4, the ship gains a 10% chance per month of breaking down
entirely until backlogged maintenance is repaired. At a shipyard, this
maintenance takes a day for a fighter hull, a week for a frigate or
cruiser, and a month for a capital ship.


<a id="repairing-hulls-and-systems"></a>

## Repairing Hulls and Systems

Fixing ship hit points can be done at a cost of 1,000 credits per
point, with up to the presiding engineer's Fix skill repaired in
points each day. A disabled system can be jury-rigged back to
functionality for one-tenth the system's cost and one day's work per
25,000 credits so spent. A jury-rigged system that is disabled again
is destroyed. Full repairs of a disabled system cost one-quarter of
its original price.

Repairs made during combat do not need to be re-done or paid for
afterwards, as they were performed before the damage could become
critical and lasting.


<a id="sidebar-sneaking-in"></a>

## Sneaking In

The free merchant *Grendel* has just drilled into a new system using
charts her captain stole from an unfortunate pirate.

As it happens, a small pirate base is positioned in the region, placed
there by its inhabitants to keep an eye on any traffic from the
adjacent system. They get a chance to detect the *Grendel*, and roll
the pirate comm officer's skill bonus of +2 plus another +2 for being
a minor outpost, and a -2 for using passive sensors to avoid alerting
targets. Their total is 12. The *Grendel*'s comms officer is good,
however, and gets a +2 for being a frigate-class ship. His Int/
Program skill roll is a 13, meaning the base has not detected the
ship.

Now the free merchant gets a chance to spot the station, also using
passive sensors at a -2 penalty. The outpost is a very visible space
station, and takes -2 on its opposed roll, while the frigate gains a
+1 on its check. The base rolls a 7 and the *Grendel* rolls an 8. The
frigate has a detection lock on the pirate base.

Her captain decides to sneak further into the system. She can't be
sure the station hasn't spotted her, but it's made no obvious sign of
it and she wants to investigate the local planets and their
inhabitants. The *Grendel*'s drive-2 engine can cross over to a
planet's region with 24 hours of travel.

This will give the station one more chance to lock the ship, since it
can try again in 24 hours. Even if it does successfully lock the free
merchant, however, the captain bets they

can lose it when they transfer out of the solar region. The pirate
base might broadcast an alert to any other local allies, however,
which could make things awkward.


<a id="space-combat"></a>

## Space Combat

The clash of ships in the void, the flash of silent explosions and
soundless death&#x2026; these things are familiar to interstellar
adventurers, and a natural hazard of the profession. While most
adventurers seek to avoid such hull-melting conflagrations of war,
sometimes the choice is not their own. When two or more ships close to
combat range with the intent to kill, it's time to fight.


<a id="the-combat-round"></a>

## The Combat Round

Space combat begins with a normal initiative roll, one made by each
ship involved in the combat. Each rolls 1d8 modified by the
Intelligence or Dexterity modifier of the pilot, and they take their
turns in order, with PCs winning ties. Once every ship has had a turn,
the round starts over from the top. Initiative is not rerolled. A
round of ship combat takes about 15 minutes, but Experts and Warriors
can only use their special class abilities to reroll skill checks or
ensure automatic hits once per engagement.

On its turn, a ship's captain decides in which order its various
departments will act: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and
captain. Each department then chooses actions, choosing either from
their specific department or a general action available to all
departments. A department head can choose actions from only one
category; they can't pick from both. Some of these actions generate

-   ***Command Points***, allowing other departments to spend these points

taking actions that require them. When all departments have acted, the
next ship in order can go.

If the ship is an NPC ship, the GM can abbreviate the process, giving
it a fixed number of Command Points based on its general crew quality,
with the ship being able to take whatever actions it needs using that
total. Fighters and civilian ships usually have 4 Command Points,
military or pirate ships have 5, native spacers and highly-trained
warships have 6, and the finest NPC crews in space can muster 7
points.


<a id="ship-departments"></a>

## Ship Departments

For purposes of interstellar combat, every ship is assumed to have
five departments: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. A
ship with too few crew to actually man these departments may have to
double-up on staffing, but these five functions are the ones that are
critical during space combat, and every ship has to be able to act on
them.

The ***bridge*** is where the ship's piloting and navigation is
done. This might be no more than the cramped cockpit of a starfighter
or it might be a cavernous central control node in the bowels of a
battleship. The bridge department handles attempts to escape combat,
perform evasive maneuvers, or pursue a fleeing enemy.

The ***gunnery*** department is in charge of the ship's weaponry. If
it's used to blow pieces out of something unfriendly, it's in the
charge of the gunners who man this department. They're the ones who
fire a ship's guns and make the targeting calculations necessary to
snipe specific systems and weapons on a hostile target.

-   ***Engineering*** keeps the ship flying when enemies are carving chunks

out of her hull. They can perform damage control, boost the engines to
speed a ship's maneuvers, and execute emergency repairs to get a
damaged system back online before it's too late.

The ***comms*** department doesn't just handle inter-ship
communications, but it also manages sensors, electronic warfare, and
combat hacking duties. Their crew can baffle enemy targeting attempts,
fool hostile sensors, and choke enemy computers with ECM.

The ***captain*** is master of the ship and directs the other
departments. On a warship, this discipline might be taut and
automatic. On a ship piloted by PCs, obedience may be less
certain. Regardless, the captain can boost the effectiveness of other
departments, direct crew for perilous but necessary tasks, or convert
otherwise-crippling hits into more manageable crises.

For player-run ships, every PC should be put in charge of one of these
departments, preferably the one that best suits their character's
skills. If a PC is totally incompetent for space combat, they can be
given temporary control of the NPC officer who actually is in charge
of the department, and can run that NPC as their character during the
fight. If the ship is so small that there is no NPC available to run
the department, then the PC is treated as a supernumerary officer, and
can only take actions from the general action list available to all
departments.

Sometimes there are fewer PCs than there are departments. In that
case, double-up the duties of two or more departments on a single
PC. That PC can still only take actions from one departments per turn;
any departments they don't take an action from are assumed to use the
*Do Your Duty* action, adding 1 Command Point to the ship's available
total. Thus, if a PC was in charge of both the bridge and the comms,
she could take actions either from the bridge list, the comms list, or
the general list of actions. If she didn't pick any action from the
bridge or comms list, the neglected department would simply use *Do
Your Duty* to add +1 Command Point to the ship's available total. For
a single-seat fighter, the lone crewman might have all five
departments on his head. Such a pilot would be able to take actions
from any single department each round with the other four providing 4
Command Points to fuel that action.

Sometimes the PCs may want to swap departments in mid-battle for some
reason, or to replace a department head who has been
incapacitated. They may do so at the start of any given combat turn
provided that the department heads involved do not object.


<a id="actions-and-command-points"></a>

## Actions and Command Points

At the start of every ship's turn, the captain decides the order in
which the departments will take their action. In the chaos of combat,
she can give directions to the heads, but they are not obligated to
follow them.

When a department's turn comes up, the PC in charge chooses actions,
either from their department list or the general action list. Some
actions may require skill checks to execute properly, while others are
automatically successful. Some actions may require Command Points to
be spent in order to attempt them, while others give Command Points. A
few prohibit the PC from doing any other action that round.

Barring these actions, a department head can take as many actions as
they have Command Points to spend on them. A gunnery chief with 4
Command Points, for example, could use the *Fire One Weapon* action
twice, spending 2 Command Points each time, or he could use the *Fire
All Guns* action once, spending 3 Command Points and leaving 1
left. The department head does not need to get permission to spend
points from the rest of the crew; if he decides to burn the points to
open fire when the rest of the crew wanted him to save them, that's
too bad for the rest of the crew. A traitorous or uncooperative
department head can only be stopped by PC intervention with the *Deal
With a Crisis* action.

After every department has acted, all excess Command Points are
lost. Ships normally start their turns with 0 Command Points.


<a id="attacks-and-damage"></a>

## Attacks and Damage

When a ship fires a weapon, it can choose any target involved in the
combat. Either the gunnery department head, an NPC, or a nominated PC
may make the attack, but a given gunner can man only one gun a
round. The gunnery head is always the one to spend Command Points to
fire, but their nominees may be the ones actually manning the guns and
rolling the attacks.

The gunner rolls a normal hit roll, using their base attack bonus plus
the better of their Intelligence or Dexterity mods, plus their Shoot
skill. If flying a fighter-class ship, Pilot may be used in place of
Shoot. Foci that normally give bonuses to Shoot attacks, such as
*Gunslinger*, do not apply to ship combat unless specifically noted as
doing so. The luck ability of the Warrior class may be used once per
fight to hit with ship guns, but cannot be used to negate a hit
against their ship.

If the hit roll equals or exceeds the target ship's Armor Class, the
attack is a success and the attacker may roll damage, again modified
by the better of the gunner's Intelligence or Dexterity
modifiers. This damage is lessened by the target's Armor score, which
may in turn be negated by a gun's Armor-Piercing quality. A successful
hit by a plasma beam, for example, does 3d6 damage plus the gunner's
attribute modifier, with an Armor Piercing quality of 10. Against a
free merchant with an Armor score of 2, the full damage of the beam
gets through, as the AP 10 cancels out all the merchant's Armor.

Armor can negate all damage from a hit if it's strong enough. If Armor
completely negates the attack, the hit cannot disable systems.

Sufficiently skilled gunners can use the *Target System* action to aim
a shot at a particular weapon system, engine, or other fitting that
seems vulnerable to the GM. On such a hit, the damage is halved,
rounded up, before Armor is applied. If any damage gets through, that
system is disabled and cannot be used until it is repaired. Engines
lose one drive rank instead, so that a drive-2 spike drive becomes a
drive-1 until repaired. Disabled systems hit again or drives reduced
below drive-0 are destroyed, and cannot be repaired during combat. A
ship with destroyed engines cannot perform any bridge actions and may
be boarded at an attacking ship's leisure, assuming its guns are also
disabled.

If a ship is reduced to zero hit points, fighter-class hulls are
instantly destroyed with all hands. Larger ships are mortally damaged.
Such crippled ships can take no action and will explode within 2d6
minutes unless the chief engineer succeeds in an Int/

Fix skill check against difficulty 10. On a failure, the explosion is
inevitable, while on a success the ship merely becomes a burnt-out
hulk with all systems destroyed. If sufficiently vast amounts of
repair supplies are still intact in the hold, a determined crew might
be able to jury-rig the maimed ship into temporary operation.


<a id="space-combat-ship-crises"></a>

## Ship Crises

Instead of accepting some particularly gruesome hit or disabling
attack, a PC ship can instead choose to accept a ***Crisis***. The
attack or the disabling hit is then negated, with no damage done.
Instead, the GM rolls on the Crisis table to find out what dire event
happened as a consequence of the hit, instead of the ship damage.

Some of these Crises are continuing. They will continue to plague the
ship until a PC can solve them with the *Deal With a Crisis* general
action. Usually this involves a skill check at difficulty 10, but
multiple PCs can choose to take the *Deal With a Crisis* action to
cooperate in resolving the problem that round.

Some of these Crises are acute. The PCs must resolve them before the
end of the ship's next turn or else something very bad will happen.

A ship can accept only one Crisis per round, not including the *Into
the Fire* or *Keep it Together* captain actions which may be taken at
the captain's discretion. Thus, if the ship is hit twice, only one of
those hits can be converted into a Crisis unless the captain uses one
of these actions. A ship accepts a Crisis if any of the department
heads requests it, even if the rest of the heads don't want one. Thus,
if the ship's main gun is hit, the gunnery chief can request a Crisis
to prevent the hit even if the rest of the crew was against it.

To simplify ship combat, NPC ships do not normally accept more than
one Crisis per space combat, at most.

They usually just take the damage or negative effects of hits straight
until facing imminent ruin.


<a id="handling-crises"></a>

## Handling Crises

To resolve a Crisis, a PC needs to take the *Deal With a Crisis*
general action on their department turn. They must explain what they
are doing to solve the problem to the GM, who will then tell them what
combination of attribute and skill they should roll. The usual
difficulty of resolving a crisis is 10, though the GM may increase or
decrease that difficulty by up to 2 points either way depending on how
bad the Crisis is and how useful the PC's plan is to resolve it.

If the PC succeeds in the roll, the Crisis is ended. Continuing Crises
no longer apply their penalty to the ship, and acute Crises are
defused before disaster can strike. If they fail, a continuing Crisis
is unchanged and an acute one is yet unresolved.

More than one PC can try to resolve a Crisis, either making an
independent attempt if they have a relevant skill, or using their
talents to aid the main responder with the usual rules for aiding
another's skill check.

The *Deal With a Crisis* general action can also be used to get a
scene's worth of general activity aboard the ship. If a xenomorphic
monster suddenly breaches the ship's hull during a battle with its
alien mothership, two of the PCs might take the *Deal With a Crisis*
action to spend a scene battling the beast in the guts of the ship
while the rest of the party tries to keep the ship fighting.


<a id="sidebar-running-a-crisis"></a>

## Running a Crisis

When a Crisis hits a ship, the GM should describe it in a concrete
way. A *Crew Lost* crisis, for example, may be described as “A damage
control squad has been trapped in the engine room and temperatures are
rising dangerously high.” A *Hull Breach* might be described as “That
last hit drove a support column through a capacitor bank; it's about
to explode.” It should be described as a specific problem that
threatens the ship.

In turn, when a PC chooses to *Deal With a Crisis*, they should
indicate what it is exactly that they're trying to do. A PC with Fix
might declare that they're trying to pump coolant into the engine
room, or a telekinetic PC might try to forcibly eject the capacitor
bank before it can explode.

Don't worry about being too technically precise with descriptions, or
painstakingly deciding whether the ship has available coolant supplies
or whether the capacitor is one ton or two. Decide whether or not the
plan the PC is declaring is plausible or not in the general sense, and
set the difficulty accordingly.  Extremely good plans or applicable
abilities might make the Crisis resolution check as easy as difficulty
8, while a very marginal plan that doesn't seem likely to help might
be difficulty 12. Whatever you do, keep it quick; don't drag it out in
play.


<a id="ship-combat-actions"></a>

## Ship Combat Actions

Every PC can take one or more actions per ship round. PCs who are
department heads can pick actions from their department. Any PC can
pick from the general actions. Some actions prohibit any other act
that round.

Most actions have a cost in Command Points. Usually, some PCs choose
to *Do Your Duty* or go *Above and Beyond* to generate Command Points,
while others then spend them on actions for their department. All
unspent Command Points are lost at the round's end.

NPC ships usually have a base number of Command Points they can spend
each round, and may pick actions freely to spend them. For simplicity,
NPC ships can't usually generate more Command Points with their
actions and can't normally take Captain actions.


<a id="bridge-actions"></a>

### Bridge Actions

-   ***<a id="org8b845bd"></a> (4 CP):*** Roll an opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/Pilot
    skill check plus your ship's Speed against the fastest opponent's
    skill check plus their ship's Speed. On a win, all enemy ships gain
    one point of Escape. If an enemy ship gets three points, after three
    uses of this maneuver, your ship gets away from that ship and is no
    longer in combat with it.

-   ***<a id="org1e09269"></a> (2 CP):*** Roll Int or Dex/Pilot against
    difficulty 9 to add your Pilot skill to the ship's AC until its next
    turn. Usable once per round at most.

-   ***<a id="orgd8bd16f"></a> (3 CP):*** Opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/ Pilot skill
    check plus Speed against the target ship's skill check plus
    Speed. On a win, you shed one point of Escape rating the target ship
    may have on you.


<a id="captain-actions"></a>

### Captain Actions

-   ***<a id="orgf85e4b4"></a> (0 CP):*** Accept a *Crew Lost* Crisis and gain your
    Lead skill plus one in Command Points. You may do this at most once
    per round.

-   ***<a id="orgf1e161e"></a> (0 CP):*** Nullify a successful enemy hit and roll
    a Crisis instead. You can use this action in Instant response to an
    enemy hit but you may only use it once per round.

-   ***<a id="org0d69dbf"></a> (0 CP):*** Choose a department. One action that
    department takes will require 2 fewer Command Points. You can do
    this once per round.


<a id="comms-actions"></a>

### Comms Actions

-   ***<a id="org892aa6a"></a> (2 CP):*** Roll an opposed Int/Program check against
    a targeted ship. On a success, it starts its next turn with a
    Command Point penalty equal to your Program skill.

-   ***<a id="orga9f16ff"></a> (2 CP):*** Roll an opposed Int/Program against a
    targeted ship. On a success, any attacks this round by your ship
    against the target get a hit bonus equal to twice your Program
    skill.

-   ***<a id="org6cd1899"></a> (2 CP):*** Succeed on a difficulty 9 Int/ Program
    check to gain your Program as an AC bonus until the next
    turn. Usable once per round at most.


<a id="engineering-actions"></a>

### Engineering Actions

-   ***<a id="orgbd2b00f"></a> (2 CP):*** Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 8. On a
    success, the ship's Speed is increased by 2 until the start of the
    ship's next turn.

-   ***<a id="orgdff9edf"></a> (3 CP):*** Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 7. On a
    success, repair a number of lost hit points equal to your Fix skill
    times 2 for fighter hulls, 3 for frigates, 4 for cruisers, and 6 for
    capital-class hulls. Each attempt of this action after the first in
    a fight increases its difficulty by a cumulative +1.

-   ***<a id="orgb91bd01"></a> (3 CP):*** Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 8. On a
    success, a disabled system is repaired or a damage-degraded drive
    has its rating increased by 1. Destroyed systems cannot be fixed
    this way.


<a id="gunnery-actions"></a>

### Gunnery Actions

-   ***<a id="org12e3d3f"></a> (3 CP):*** Gunners fire all weapons mounted on the
    ship, designating targets as they wish.

-   ***<a id="org45b089b"></a> (2 CP):*** A gunner fires a single ship's weapon of
    their choice.

-   ***<a id="orgf899548"></a> (1 CP):*** A *Fire One Weapon* action you take this
    round may target a ship's weapons, engine, or fittings the GM
    decides are vulnerable. Such targeted attacks take -4 to hit. On a
    hit, do half damage before applying Armor. If damage gets through
    the system is disabled or drive is degraded by 1 level. Disabled
    systems hit again are destroyed. You may take this action more than
    once to aim additional shots you may fire.


<a id="general-actions"></a>

### General Actions

All these general actions are exclusive; if you take one of these
actions you can do nothing else in the round, either before or after
you take the action.

-   ***<a id="org7cf4ed3"></a> (0 CP):*** Push yourself to help the ship or its
    crew. Pick an attribute and skill check and explain how you're using
    it to help the ship. If the GM agrees, roll it against
    difficulty 9. On a success, gain your skill level in Command Points
    plus one. On a failure, take -1 Command Point.

-   ***<a id="orgc7bcae1"></a> (0 CP):*** Explain what you are doing to solve a
    Crisis and roll the relevant skill check. The difficulty is usually
    10, plus or minus 2 depending on the situation and the effectiveness
    of your action. On a success, the Crisis is resolved. You may also
    use this action to aid another PC in resolving a Crisis, or to take
    one scene's worth of other actions around the ship.

-   ***<a id="orge687a66"></a> (0 CP):*** The ship gains 1 Command Point. PCs who
    head more than one department can act only in one of them; the rest
    automatically take this action. If invoked by a PC, they must name
    some plausible act the PC is doing to be useful, and can't do the
    same act two rounds in a row.


<a id="actions-ship-crises"></a>

## Ship Crises

Once per round, a ship may choose to accept a Crisis instead of taking
an enemy hit. They must choose to do so immediately after damage is
rolled, and only one player needs to request the Crisis to get it even
if the rest of the party doesn't want it. Once the Crisis is accepted,
the hit is negated and the GM rolls on the table.

The captain may also choose to voluntarily accept a Crisis through
their *Keep It Together* or *Into the Fire* department actions. Use of
these actions doesn't count against the one-voluntary-Crisis-perround
maximum.

Some Crises are continuing. They will apply a penalty to the ship that
continues until some PC successfully performs a *Deal With a Crisis*
action.

Other Crises are acute. They inflict no immediate negative
consequence, but if the PCs don't resolve it by the end of the next
combat round, an unpleasant consequence will ensue. The Crisis is then
removed.

The same Crisis rolled more than once will stack on the ship, though
hits to empty cargo holds or dry fuel tanks may not be much of a
problem to the ship.


<a id="dealing-with-a-crisis"></a>

## Dealing With a Crisis

Any PC can *Deal With a Crisis* by taking that general action and
describing what they're doing to solve the problem. They then roll an
applicable skill check against difficulty 10, possibly modified by up
to plus or minus two depending on the GM's judgment of their general
plan and its likelihood of being helpful. On a success, the Crisis is
resolved. All Crises are considered resolved at the end of an
engagement.


<a id="crises"></a>

## Crises

-   ***<a id="org90f02e5"></a>:*** The hit melted an important patch of ship armor,
    cracked an internal support, or exposed a sensitive system. Until
    resolved, the ship's Armor rating is halved, rounded down.

-   ***<a id="org66ea804"></a>:*** The hit has gored open a cargo bay, threatening to
    dump the hold or expose delicate contents to ruinous damage. If not
    resolved by the end of the next round, lose d10\*10% of the ship's
    cargo.

-   ***<a id="orgb29a718"></a>:*** Brave crew risk their lives to keep damaged systems
    operating. Describe the danger they face. If the Crisis is not
    resolved by the end of the next round, 10% of the ship's maximum
    crew are incapacitated, not counting any *Extended Life Support*
    fittings.

Half these crewmen are dead or permanently disabled, and the other
half return to duty in a week. *Extended Medbay* fittings halve the
number of dead and crippled. If the ship has run out of NPC crew when
it takes this Crisis, a random PC must roll a Physical save; on a
success, they lose half their hit points, while on a failure, they are
mortally wounded. If not stabilized by the end of the ship's turn
through some PC taking a *Deal With A Crisis* action to heal them,
they will die.

</table>

-   ***<a id="org6ede283"></a>:*** The ship's engine has been jammed or control
    circuits have gone non-responsive. Until resolved, no bridge actions
    can be taken, though the pilot can still perform general actions.

-   ***<a id="org9355c62"></a>:*** The ship's fuel tanks have been holed or emergency
    vents have been force-triggered by battle damage. If not resolved by
    the end of the next round, the ship will jettison all fuel except
    the minimal amount needed for in-system operation.

-   ***<a id="org5a854fa"></a>:*** Critical command links have been damaged or
    disordered by the hit. Until resolved, the ship starts each round at
    -2 Command Points. Multiple such Crises can stack this penalty,
    crippling a ship until the Crises are resolved.

-   ***<a id="orgd79166b"></a>:*** The hull has been damaged in a way that is
    currently non-critical but is about to tear open an important
    compartment or crumple on vital systems. If not resolved by the end
    of the next round, the ship will take damage: 1d10 for fighter-class
    hulls, 2d10 for frigates, 3d10 for cruisers, and 4d10 for capital
    hulls, all ignoring Armor.

-   ***<a id="org574600b"></a>:*** One of the ship's systems has been cooked by the
    hit. The GM randomly picks a weapon, fitting, or engine; that system
    is disabled as if hit with a targeted shot, with drives suffering a
    1 point drive level decrease. Disabled systems hit by this Crisis or
    drives reduced below drive-0 are destroyed and cannot be repaired
    during combat.

-   ***<a id="orgd714012"></a>:*** The gunnery computers are hopelessly
    confused and cannot lock the ship's weaponry on a target until this
    Crisis is resolved.

-   ***<a id="orgde552f6"></a>:*** Shipboard damage threatens a random PC or
    important NPC. That victim must immediately roll a Physical saving
    throw; on a success, they lose half their hit points, and on a
    failure they are mortally wounded. NPC crew can make a free attempt
    to stabilize the downed VIP using their usual NPC skill bonus. If
    the NPC fails, and no PC takes a *Deal With a Crisis* action to
    successfully stabilize them by the end of the ship's turn, they die.


<a id="sidebar-the-thunder-of-the-guns"></a>

## The Thunder of the Guns

The free merchant *Grendel* finds herself engaging the *Sacred Wrath*,
a patrol boat of the Luminous Hegemony determined to stop the
*Grendel* before it can deliver its cargo of military supplies to the
rebel outpost that contracted the ship. Captain Wilhelmina Stokes
knows she's substantially outclassed by the patrol boat, but she
trusts her comrades and is determined to blast her way through.

The combat begins with an initiative roll. The *Grendel*'s pilot rolls
1d8 plus the best of his Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers, getting
a 6. The *Wrath*'s pilot rolls a 4, so *Grendel* goes first.

Grendel starts her turn with 0 Command Points. Captain Stokes decides
that she'll act first among the crew, and uses the *Support Department*
action to aid the gunnery department; one action the gunner takes will
be 2 Command Points cheaper than usual.

The ship still has no Command Points, however, so Captain Stokes tells
the comms chief to go next. Feeling daring, the comms chief decides to
go *Above and Beyond* to help the ship, overclocking the ship's
computing core. The GM decides this is an Int/Program skill check, so
the comms chief rolls it against difficulty 9. He fails his first
roll, but uses his Expert class reroll benefit to try again, and gets
it the second time. The ship gains 3 Command Points for the comms
chief's Program-2 skill.

Stokes considers letting the gunner blaze away now, but she wants to
go for a real torrent of fire to open the fight, so she asks the
bridge pilot to act next to build more Command Points. He chooses to
*Do Your Duty*, adding 1 CP and declaring that he's lining the ship up
for the shot.

Three Command Points aren't enough for the captain, so despite the
gunner's entreaties, she chooses for the engineer to go next. She also
plays it safe, deciding to *Do Your Duty* and feed power to the guns.

Lastly, there's a sixth PC in the crew, a storyteller with absolutely
no applicable space-faring skills. Even though he is no department
head, the captain nominates him to act next, since every PC gets to
act each round. Able to take only general actions, the storyteller
chants a mighty lay of battle to encourage his comrades on to
glory. The GM lets him roll a Cha/Perform skill check to go *Above and
Beyond*, and he succeeds, adding 3 more Command Points from his
Perform-2 skill.

Now, at last, with 8 Command Points, the captain gives the gunner her
signal. The gunner decides that it's absolutely critical to defang the
patrol boat before it can open up with its plasma beam. He chooses to
*Target Systems* with his attack, spending 1 CP. He knows the free
merchant's sandcaster has no chance of piercing the patrol boat's
armor, but his multifocal laser can cut through the ship's
plating. Thus, instead of trying to fire the sandcaster this round, he
decides to blaze away exclusively with the laser, using the *Fire One
Weapon* action.

Firing one weapon costs 2 Command Points and he has 5 left, plus the
captain's *Support Department* action to give him a zero-cost shot.

The gunner is a grizzled Warrior and uses his class ability to make
the first shot an automatic hit. He rolls 1d4 for damage, +1 for his
Dexterity modifier, and gets a 3. The multifocal laser's
armor-piercing quality of 20 overwhelms the patrol boat's Armor of 5,
but since he's *Targeting Systems*, his damage is halved, rounded
up. The patrol boat takes 2 hit points of damage&#x2026; but its plasma
beam is now disabled until the boat's crew can perform repairs.

The gunner's not satisfied; he wants that gun wrecked. He *Fires One
Weapon* again for 2 CP, *Targeting Systems* once more for 1 CP,
rolling a hit roll at -4 and using his Shoot skill and Dexterity
attribute to modify his attack bonus. He hits with a 15 and does
another 2 damage, destroying the gun.

The GM decides that the patrol boat's captain is willing to go to
extremes to prevent this, and lets him accept a Crisis instead. The GM
rolls 1d10 and gets the *Hull Breach* crisis; if the boat can't
resolve it by the end of the next round, it'll take 2d10 hit points of
damage that ignores Armor, but for now the gunner's second hit is
negated. The gunner has 2 CP left, so he burns those and his
captain-supplied free shot on two more attacks, both of which
miss. The round ends, and if the *Grendel* had any CP left it would
lose them now.

Being a properly-trained military crew, the *Sacred Wrath* has 5
Command Points. Her captain knows that her absolute priority is
getting her gun back online, so he spends 3 points to do *Emergency
Repairs* from the engineer actions. The GM rolls her crew's default +2
skill bonus and gets a 9, enough to fix the plasma beam and remove its
disabled status.

That leaves the NPC ship with 2 Command Points left, which is just
enough to open fire. The gunner blasts away with the plasma beam,
using his hit bonus of +4 to get a 17, enough to hit the
*Grendel*. The plasma beam does 12 points of damage to the free
merchant, its AP 10 defeating the target's Armor.

Captain Stokes can't handle a hit like this and immediately accepts a
Crisis. The GM rolls an *Armor Loss* result, halving the *Grendel*'s
already-sad Armor.

The next round then begins. The PCs have the edge, as the *Wrath* is
going to need to *Deal With a Crisis* or take a heavy hit at round's
end. If the *Grendel*'s gunner can't shut down that plasma beam,
however, the free merchant runs the risk of eating more hits than it
can survive&#x2026; or trying to evade those hits and rolling a Crisis her
crew can't handle.


<a id="chapter-the-history-of-space"></a>

# THE HISTORY OF SPACE

The default setting of ***Stars Without Number*** is a far future age in
which the sprawling, glorious domain of human space has been reduced
to a scattering of squabbling powers and long-lost worlds. The ancient
domain of humanity has shrunken with the collapse of the psi-powered
Jump Gates that once stitched the remote regions of the frontier into
the teeming worlds of the human core.

Now, almost six hundred years after the catastrophe that ended the
Golden Age of Man, new hope rises from the wreckage of a fallen
empire.


<a id="in-the-beginning"></a>

## In the Beginning

Humanity's interstellar history began in a musty instafab laboratory
on a remote coast in northern Greenland in the year 2108. A small army
of jury-rigged microfab plants and hotwired autofacs had been churning
for years, painstakingly realizing the plans of their
creator. Dr. Tiberius Crohn was an insular lunatic of the first water,
a laughingstock among physicists and a regular font of absurd
claims. Were it not for his admitted talent at wrangling autofacs he
would likely have vanished into the twenty-second century's faceless
proletarian mass without so much as a ripple.

His talents had gotten him the parts and resources to establish his
laboratory in the radioactive wilds of Greenland, not far from the hot
zone left by a missile from the Russo-European War. The glow masked
the peculiar emissions from his test units, but in 2108 his work
finally reached fruition. Crohn had invented the spike drive, the
faster-than-light engine that would lift humanity to the stars.

Even now, a thousand years later, researchers still wonder how Crohn
managed to devise the mathematics and theories that supported the
spike drive's creation. Widespread claims of “alien influence” were
debunked by later Mandate historians, but rumors of these “Mentors”
are still stock space legends.

Some of the axioms involved defied all perceptible reality, and the
theories made certain assumptions about the fabric of the universe
that spun off at least a dozen new religions within the first two
hundred years of the discovery. The spike drive was a window on a
universe far stranger and vaster than experimenters had thought
possible.

Through a delicate gravitic twisting of the universal substrate
beneath a ship, the spike drive drove it “upward” through a spectrum
of dimensional frequencies. The ship vanished from mundane, “luminal”
space and was thrust into the metadimensions. These inchoate realms of
vast energy currents and formless masses were extremely hostile to
unprepared ships, but their gravitic currents propelled a ship at
speeds impossible in the mundane universe. Suitably massive objects
such as stars cast a “shadow” into these metadimensions, forming both
navigational beacons and anchor-points that enabled transit up and
down the dimensional spectrum. So long as a spike drive had a star to
launch from and a star to bring it down, it could ride the
metadimensional currents in a headlong rush of superluminal speed.

The initial transit along a course was always the most dangerous. The
metadimensional currents were unmapped on those routes, and a
navigator had to make regular course corrections in hope of finding a
current that would bring them to their course before the spike drive's
protective bubble broke down in the metadimensional environment.

Once the initial journey had been made, course rutters could be shared
with other ships. So long as ships regularly made the transit, any
shifts in the currents could be recorded. If a route lay fallow for
too long, however, the slow creep of currents would render the rutters
worse than useless, and a fresh course would need to be plotted by
some brave crew.

Crohn's discovery was announced by the sudden launch of his
retrofitted spacecraft-laboratory from the Greenland hot zone. A
number of orbital weapons platforms attempted to bring it down, but
the spike drive provided such a wildly anomalous maneuver profile that
the tracking algorithms were hopelessly confused. Earthside watch
stations followed him out to the edge of the solar system, dutifully
recording his ship's impossible velocity. At the very rim of the
system the sensors picked up a strange gravitic surge, and he was
gone.

He returned thirteen days later, broadcasting a radio transmission
that not only included data on Alpha Centauri that could only have
been acquired through on-site surveying, but also included the
necessary data for the reconstruction of the spike drive. Between the
observations of the tracking stations and the content of the signal,
there was no doubt of it; mad old Crohn had actually done it.

Even today, no one is entirely certain how he managed it. A prototype
spike drive would have required six days of metadimensional travel to
reach Alpha Centauri and drill down into mundane space. Crohn claimed
to be alone aboard the ship, but such would have required him to
remain awake and navigating the uncharted drill course for six
straight days, all without any hint of prior experience. The creed
that later became known as the *Book of the Sky* refers to it as “the
Night Journey of the Prophet Tiberius” and considers it the founding
event of the faith.

Tiberius himself promptly drilled back out into metaspace once his
transmission had been sent. He was never seen again. To this day,
thirteen known religious sects are convinced that he was translated
directly into the presence of God as a fitting reward to the opener of
the celestial ways.


<a id="the-first-wave-of-colonization"></a>

## The First Wave of Colonization

Exclusivity was impossible with this new discovery. Overnight, every
industrialized nation on Earth began a frantic rush to build spike
drive-equipped starships, each nation fearing to be left behind in
claiming the stars above. Paradoxically, earthside tensions faded
rapidly as the disposition of this spit of land or that patch of oil
seemed to be trivial compared to the wealth that awaited in the sky.

Initial exploration revealed that the spike drives had a maximum range
before the corrosive effect of the metadimensional environment fatally
degraded their protective bubbles of mundane space. It was necessary
to hop from star to star, reaching more distant stellar bodies by
progressive advance. In the course of these explorations numerous
exotic planetary bodies were discovered. The first one habitable by
human beings was a barren mudball with an oxygen-rich atmosphere
discovered in 2113. Dubbed Renaissance by its Greater European
discoverers, it drove the other Terran nations outward in an even
greater frenzy of exploratory acquisitiveness.

Pan-Indian scouts discovered the first life-bearing world in 2150. The
primordial soup that covered the water world of Pranashakti served as
a research subject for a generation of xenobiologists. The excitement
was only heightened when an American survey craft discovered the
ancient alien ruins on the mist-shrouded moon called Typhon. Their
creators had vanished more than 40,000 years ago, but the scanty
remains showed evidence of a technologically sophisticated culture
possessing a humanoid anatomy not wholly unlike that of humankind.

This First Wave of colonization sent humanity in a steadily expanding
sphere from the green fields of Terra. By 2200, most habitable worlds
within a year's spike drive travel had at least a handful of human
inhabitants. Numerous political and religious splinter groups took to
the heavens once asteroid mining brought the price of a spike
drive-equipped starship within the reach of a large corporation.
Humanity was growing beyond the reach of its leaders.


<a id="retrenchment-and-the-mandate"></a>

## Retrenchment and the Mandate

The governments of Terra grew increasingly concerned with their
far-flung colonists. Even the fastest spike drive courier couldn't
reach the Rim worlds in less than four months, and projecting military
force at such a distance was beyond the power of all but the strongest
nations. Rather than let their colonists slip entirely out of their
control, the greater powers on Terra agreed to form the Terran
Mandate, an organization dedicated to policing human space and
exerting the authority of Terran governments over the far-flung colony
worlds.

Furthermore, expansion beyond the current Rim worlds was forbidden.
Splinter groups, cults, and microcultures were required to live within
the pale and were forbidden to colonize worlds of their own for
reasons of “social harmony” and “interstellar security”. More than a
few of these groups defied the new Mandate and sought worlds beyond
their reach in the far dark. Deprived of the usual sources of support,
most were never heard from again.

Even with these new limits, the Terran Mandate was hard-pressed to
contain the colonial worlds. There was little in the way of actual
fighting between the colonies, as few had the ships or manpower to
spare, but here and there the more zealous splinter groups or
dedicated ideologues could not bear to live in peace with their
neighbors. The Mandate kept a loose sort of discipline over the Rim
worlds but by the year 2260 direct control was tenuous at best.

## MES and the Psionic Authority

It was during the peak of the First Wave, in 2240, that the first
instances of a frightening new syndrome appeared in the children of
starship crew members. Perhaps one in ten thousand of these children
would begin to exhibit strange and inexplicable powers. Some time
around puberty, abilities manifested that ranged from an intuitive
vision of the immediate future, to inexplicable mind-reading, to
powers of superluminal teleportation. Children who exercised these
abilities invariably suffered progressive and permanent neural damage
leading either to death or permanent insanity. A dozen uses, two
dozen&#x2026; sooner or later the damage overwhelmed the victim. Only by
completely avoiding use of these powers could a child's mind be saved.

Dubbed “Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome”, or “MES” by
researchers, these subjects were gathered for extensive testing and
examination. Parents were told that the children would be taught ways
of controlling and suppressing their abilities, but most modern
researchers believe that some among the children were used as guinea
pigs in terrible experiments meant to quantify this new power.
Whatever the means, the investigators soon learned that “Messes” were
actually serving as living channels for waves of metadimensional
energy.

The power was shaped and focused by the wielder's neural
pathways. Mere meat was never meant to endure the kind of energies
that boiled through a Mess, and neural pathways were left scorched or
burnt out entirely by use of the powers. Every test was
destructive. The only question was whether repeated use of the powers
would kill the Mess' body first or take their sanity. Researchers also
discovered that once the energies had finally burnt out a victim's
mind, the charred brain pathways were effectively immune to further
damage. An insane Mess, or “feral” could use their powers with
impunity, and usually did.

It wasn't until 2275 that these shadowy researches finally bore fruit.
The damage to a Mess's mind could not be avoided, but by
individualized programs of meditation, focus, and mental training, the
damage could be routed through less critical areas of the brain. A
properly-trained “psychic”, as they were now called, could use their
powers extensively before the charge threatened to overflow their
existing channels and they were required to rest and recuperate.

Formulating these programs of study required a trained psychic mentor
to shape the basic curriculum into the correct sequence of meditations
for a given pupil. Despite the best efforts of researchers, it proved
impossible to impart this education through recorded means of
instruction. A living, psychically-active metapsion tutor properly
educated in the training protocols was mandatory in teaching new
psychics.

In an attempt to control the provision of psychic mentors, the Terran
Mandate inaugurated the Psionic Authority. The PA grew to be a quiet
but pervasive organization throughout human space, taking young MES
sufferers into its care for training. The rarity of MES left psychics
largely as figures of mystery and no little fear to less gifted
humans. Psychics could often make vast sums of money with their
powers, but many worlds established sharp restrictions on psychic
activities&#x2026; and then often employed government-sponsored psychics
who could ignore the strictures.


<a id="first-contacts"></a>

## First Contacts

As these changes rippled through human culture, the species found
itself no longer alone in the cosmos. The steady expansion of human
space discovered more than empty ruins on several habitable
worlds. The Young Races such as the Kont and Ualub were found
inhabiting their ancestral worlds, diligently building their way
towards Bronze Age technologies. Some species seemed to be the
decaying remnants of a former empire, such as the handful of used-up
worlds that housed the weary race of Mettau and their cities of
dancing glass. These Elder Races had all had their time in the sun,
tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago, only to fall prey to
internecine strife, vainglorious experimentation, or sheer cultural
ennui.

Some of these alien races were strong and vigorous still, though
usually fresh from their own technological youth. A few short, sharp
border wars usually settled matters in humanity's favor, and even
those wars that were not so successfully prosecuted lost mankind only
a few worlds within easy reach of their rivals. More often, these
races formed uneasy trade pacts with humanity, exchanging examples of
strange alien technology and art for the science of human worlds.

The majority of sentient alien species that humanity discovered shared
roughly similar humanoid dimensions. Called “the Like” by
xenobiologists, controversy still bubbles over the seeming prevalence
of humanoid form among alien races. Some scientists suggest that the
humanoid shape is simply the one most suitable to the expression of
sentience. Others find this explanation too simplistic, and believe
that humanoid shapes are simply most suitable to the kind of
human-habitable biomes that draw the most interest from human
explorers. Further exploration might reveal legions of supercondensed
life forms in the core of gas giant worlds, or flocks of
hydrogen-based webs floating in the darkness between stars.

Some species owe nothing to human form. These Others are alien in a
way that no oxygen-breather could possibly be. Some are composed of
silicon or alien earth compounds, such as the “lithomorphs” and their
planetoid-ships. Others are congeries of spherical atmosphere-bubbles,
or sentient interference-patterns set up in the oceans of an
ammonia-covered liquid world. The Others are almost invariably too
different in mind and needs for humans to communicate with them. Their
acts of violence are inexplicable and seemingly random, and their
purposes defy human comprehension. Psychics who attempt to contact the
mind of an Other risk their sanity under waves of awareness utterly
unlike the thoughts of a fleshly brain.


<a id="pretech-psitech-and-the-gates"></a>

## Pretech, Psitech, and the Gates

Psionic Authority researchers had not halted their study of MES
energies after their initial training breakthroughs. Official
histories credit the discoveries to the courage of a few psychics
willing to conduct destructive, dangerous experiments on their own
minds. Legends speak more of criminal psychics and bewildered young
Messes “encouraged” to cooperate in experiments that eventually
claimed their sanity or their lives.

Whatever the source of the data, the Psionic Authority was able to
formulate new techniques of psychic power. These abilities were
usually very subtle and esoteric, microscopic adjustments of ambient
universal constants that allowed for the manufacture of materials and
products that were simply impossible to create with technology bound
to the mundane world's laws. Atoms and molecules danced to the will of
these fabricator psychics, and new wonders were born from the
factories of humanity.

The introduction of psychic fabrication marked the development of
“pretech”, the high science and artifice of the Golden Age of Man.
Pretech artifacts were marvelous works, most of them performing some
miracle of energy manipulation or material science. Pretech spike
drives doubled the maximum reach of a drill course, and pretech drugs
and biotech gave humankind several centuries of hale good health
before age might claim them.

The greatest accomplishment of pretech, however, was in the
development of “psitech”, a complex melding of psychofabricated
pretech components and psionically-active materials. Psitech devices
could channel and amplify a psychic's abilities to a remarkable
degree. Psitech was never common, given the rarity of psychics
themselves, but it found regular employment in pretech manufactories.

The greatest accomplishment of psitech, in turn, was the development
of the Jump Gates. These massive rings of psitech resonators floated
at the far rim of a solar system, wide enough to receive the slowboat
freighters that lumbered out from planetary orbits. With the help of a
choir of master psychic teleporters, these ships would be hurled for
scores of light years across the galaxy, emerging from a Jump Gate
held in waiting at their destination point. The weeks or months of
spike drive travel that would otherwise be required were compressed
into a few days.

The Jump Gates quickly replaced spike drive travel throughout the core
regions of human space. The only check on their expansion was finding
the necessary number of master teleporters to power them, and the
great expense of shipping components out to more distant worlds unable
to fabricate them on-site. By 2450, almost all core and Rim worlds
were served by Jump Gates. The ease and cheapness of mass interstellar
transport caused some worlds to specialize as agricultural planets and
other worlds to rely on interstellar food imports.

By 2600, spike drives were antiquated technology, found almost
exclusively along the frontier of human space where Jump Gates were
too expensive and economies too primitive to justify their use.


<a id="the-second-wave"></a>

## The Second Wave

By then, the Second Wave of human colonization had reached its peak.
The development of the Jump Gates had allowed the Terran Mandate to
project its military strength far more easily, and the prohibitions on
expansion had been loosened. By 2600, the frontier of human space
extended almost ten years of spike drive travel away from Terra. Even
after taking Jump Gates as far as possible, a fast pretech courier
ship required a year to reach the farthest colonial worlds.

The Jump Gates allowed for massive numbers of colonists to flee the
stultifying bonds of stratified Terran society. Over four billion
people left Terra over the course of the Second Wave, most of them
sent gladly by governments that were more than willing to dispose of
their more troublesome subjects. It wasn't until late in the Second
Wave that the Terran Mandate began to realize that it simply didn't
have the manpower necessary to police the colonial worlds. Even with
the overwhelming technological advantage of Terran fleets, there were
simply too many colonies and too many colonists to maintain direct
control.

The colonies realized this as well, starting around 2450. There was
rarely an explicit rebellion against the Mandate; most often it was a
disobedience of slow decay, with tax shipments becoming intermittent
and then absent, and Mandate orders obeyed first slowly and then not
at all. The Mandate fleet struck a few of the most valuable
recalcitrants, but it was a rear-guard action. The Terran Mandate had
grown itself beyond its ability to maintain control.

In the wild void of the frontier, spike drive armadas and petty
stellar kingdoms formed to settle ancient arguments between
ideologies, religions, and simple differences of ambition. Maltech
research began to take root on more isolated worlds, with forbidden
research into unbraked AIs, replicant nanotech, and weapons of
planetary destruction. Some worlds began to experiment with human
genomic modification beyond anything that convention had
permitted. These eugenics cultists sought the wholesale improvement of
the human genetic legacy despite the terrible costs in maladaptive
mutation and instability. Forces of the Terran Mandate's Perimeter
agency tried to contain these researches, but often were simply too
few and too poorly supported to do more than report on events.

The Golden Age of Man was already strained by the pressures of these
squabbling worlds and a Mandate grown senile. Its deathblow was yet to
come.


<a id="the-scream-and-the-silence"></a>

## The Scream and the Silence

In 2665 a massive wave of metadimensional energy washed over human
space. Spike drive craft in metaspace were annihilated instantly, and
in the blink of an eye, every psychic in human space immediately
suffered the consequences of catastrophic psychic burnout. The
majority died instantly, with the handful that remained raving in the
grip of incurable madness.

Later reconstruction placed the origin of this “Scream” somewhere in
the Veil Nebula, but no records exist of any successful investigation.
Too much collapsed too quickly for any sort of exploratory expedition
to be sent. Humanity was suddenly stripped of every psychic resource.
Without living mentors, new generations of psychics could not be
trained without recreating the entire laborious research corpus of the
now-erased Psionic Authority. It would take generations to mold
functional mentors out of the untrained mass of native psychics.

There was no time to recreate the necessary training. The Jump Gates
were dead, and the core worlds of human space collapsed with
them. Countless colonies that relied on the bulk produce of
agricultural worlds were left starving within months, their shipyards
overrun by the desperate and ruined in the convulsive fighting over
the few remaining spike drive ships. There was no possible way to feed
a world of millions with the limited freight capacity of spike drive
ships; only the Jump Gates and their massive slowboat freighters could
move such masses of cargo, and the slowboats were too big to be
retrofitted with spike drives&#x2026; even if they could cross the stars
quickly enough to make a difference, which they could not.

Echoes of the disaster rippled outward. The frontier regions were
still too poor and primitive to afford Jump Gates, so the worlds that
remained on the edge of human space were forced to supply their own
population with food and other necessities. Some of these worlds
relied on small shipments of vital supplies from the core
worlds. These luckless planets died when their motherworlds
perished. Others were more self-reliant, but few of these had the
necessary resources to build spike drive ships of their own. Those few
worlds that were able to construct the ships struggled as their
psitech became useless and their shipments of vital core world
components stopped.

Human space had collapsed into a welter of isolated worlds.
Interstellar travel fell to the handful of spike drive ships that
could be kept running on scavenged components and half-derelict
spaceyards. The Silence had begun.


<a id="the-silence-ends"></a>

## The Silence Ends

For almost six hundred years, humanity has been slowly recovering from
the consequences of the Scream. Many frontier worlds have collapsed
into barbarism and balkanized warfare. These “lost worlds” have
sufficient resources for agriculture and life, but lack the fossil
fuels or radioactives necessary to bootstrap modern technology. Some
have even forgotten their origins or have had them obscured in the
haze of legend and myth.

Other worlds have been more fortunate. These planets have been lucky
enough to have the resources necessary to sustain a rough and ready
level of technology. Their fusion plants are bulkier than the pretech
that existed before the Scream, their spike drive engines are slower
and more unstable, and the medical technology is working well if it
can give the population even a hundred years of good health before
death claims them. Still, these worlds have managed to devise methods
for doing without the esoteric disciplines of the psychic fabricators
and are slowly ramping up their production of spike drive ships as
their techniques improve. This “postech” may be inferior, but after
the Silence it can be replicated in a way that pretech cannot.

A few worlds have even managed to rediscover the basic techniques of
psychic mentorship. The fabulously subtle and sophisticated
disciplines necessary for recreating the old pretech manufactories are
still long-lost, but these new academies are at least able to teach
their students how to channel their powers in relatively safe and
useful ways. Some worlds guard these secrets jealously, but others
make substantial profit out of training foreign psychics sent by
neighboring worlds. A few academies operate without any governmental
supervision at all, willingly teaching their secrets to anyone with
the money or a compatible ideology.

Stellar domains have begun to form around the most powerful worlds.
Projecting more than a few tens of thousands of troops to a
neighboring world is far beyond the abilities of most planets, so
these domains tend to be loose confederacies of like-minded worlds, or
else sparsely-populated colonies held under the ruthless control of a
vastly larger and more powerful neighbor. Most of these domains are
held together by a glue of ideology and trade benefits, and border
skirmishes are becoming more common between rival space empires.

The alien neighbors of humanity have not been idle during the
Silence. The Scream appears to have affected psychically-active races
as badly as the humans were wounded, but those species that were not
so vulnerable have expanded into human space at several points on the
frontier. Some have even gone so far as to seize human worlds for
their own. In a few unfortunate regions of human space, entire sectors
have been conquered by alien powers.

Now, in the year 3200, the fragile web of interstellar commerce and
exploration has been reformed. Countless worlds remain locked in the
darkness of the Silence, awaiting the bold merchants or reckless
explorers willing to return them to the embrace of interstellar
humanity. And if these brave souls should be rewarded with the ancient
wealth in salvage and data so long trapped on these worlds, who is to
say that they do not deserve it?


<a id="a-timeline-of-the-future"></a>

## A TIMELINE OF THE FUTURE

-   ***2108:*** The spike drive is discovered by crank scientist
    Dr. Tiberius Crohn. Humanity moves almost overnight from a handful
    of science stations on the solar system's inner worlds to all-out
    interstellar exploration. Numerous Terran governments seek the
    resources of new worlds.

-   ***2110:*** Several scout craft are lost while learning the limits of
    the spike drive. The dangers of excessive frequency climbing are
    recorded by survivors.

-   ***2113:*** The first habitable extrasolar world is discovered by the
    scout ship *Magellan*. The ship's patrons promptly claim the world
    for Greater Europe and name it Renaissance.

-   ***2120:*** Pranashakti, the first life-bearing alien world, is
    discovered by a Pan-Indian scout ship. The organisms consist solely
    of plant analogues and some primitive marine life, but a generation
    of xenobiologists finds work in analyzing it all.

-   ***2130:*** The development of asteroid mining technology provides
    vast amounts of raw materials to Earth's orbital shipyards and
    factories. Ship prices plunge, and numerous smaller organizations
    and states become capable of stellar exploration.

-   ***2150:*** The ruins of an advanced alien species are discovered on
    Typhon, an otherwise unremarkable gas giant moon. Archaeologists
    date the ruins to approximately 40,000 BCE. Dubbed “the Watchers”
    for the eye-like circular motifs on the ruins, few details are
    learned about the species.

-   ***2200:*** The First Wave of human expansion reaches its peak. Most
    habitable planets within a year's travel time from Earth have been
    successfully colonized, many by small religious or ideological
    groups. Terran nations begin to forbid further exploration for fear
    of being unable to maintain control over their offworld colonies
    over such distances. The Terran Mandate is organized by Earth's
    superpowers in order to ensure that Terran control of the colonies
    continues.

-   ***2240:*** “Metadimensional Extroversion Syn drome” begins to
    manifest in certain fifth-generation spacers. Occurring most often
    around puberty, the abilities exhibited by MES victims seem flatly
    impossible by normal scientific measure: telepathy, teleportation,
    precognitive flashes, and other abilities that defy
    understanding. The syndrome is inevitably fatal unless the victim
    avoids all use of their uncanny abilities.

-   ***2260:*** Some colony worlds begin to grow restive, and there are
    incidents of skirmishing and piracy on the frontier. Few disputes
    are over resources, but ideological and religious conflicts become
    more common. The Terran Mandate struggles to deal with the
    twelvemonth message delay between Earth and the farthest colony
    worlds.

-   ***2275:*** Researchers on several deep-space colonies begin to
    develop methods for controlling the advance of MES, allowing its
    victims to use their abilities without inflicting permanent brain
    damage on themselves. The lives lost in this research are never
    fully numbered, but Terran governments rapidly move to control the
    research and training under the aegis of the “Psionic Authority”.

-   ***2280:*** Properly-trained MES carriers, known commonly as
    “psychics”,or more casually, as “Messes”, begin to use their
    abilities to assist governments and private enterprise. Numerous
    fields begin to benefit from the assistance of MES subjects, ranging
    from telepathic mental health providers to precognitive industrial
    managers. The Psionic Authority begins to experiment with more
    focused, industrially-useful psionic disciplines. Again, the cost in
    lives is undisclosed.

-   ***2315:*** The Psionic Authority perfects the first jump gate. A
    massive ring of psitech placed at the periphery of the solar system,
    the gate employs a choir of over fifty master teleporters to
    instantly translate ships to a matching gate at Renaissance. Gate
    dispersal is slowed by a lack of master teleporters, but eventually
    the transit time between Earth and the frontier is reduced to two
    days. The Earth nations lift the ban on further exploration now that
    their effective control is enhanced.

-   ***2330:*** The Second Wave of human colonization begins. Spike drive
    ships become all but unknown within the core worlds as the jump
    gates allow cheaper system ships to travel between the older
    colonies.

-   ***2350:*** Psitech-enhanced manufactory abilities and precognitive
    surveyors vastly increase the rate of viable colonization. Almost
    two billion humans leave Earth for the wealth and freedom of the
    colony worlds. The Terran Mandate begins to realize that they now
    lack the manpower necessary to maintain control over so many
    colonies, even with the reduced transit time.

-   ***2400:*** Obedience to Terran governments is now a polite fiction on
    the frontier, in those cases when it is acknowledged at all. The
    first stellar unions begin to form. Some neighboring worlds resort
    to war, but most colonists see no need for fighting with so many
    unexploited resources.

-   ***2425:*** The Terran Mandate has become deeply corrupt and
    hopelessly decadent. Its Directors concern themselves exclusively
    with their own interests, rivalries, and ideological
    obsessions. Only the AI Maestros of Earth act as a check on their
    actions, as the Directors are unable to effectively control the
    Mandate without the help of their AI adjuncts. These AIs struggle to
    maintain a basic level of probity among their creators.

-   ***2450:*** The Second Wave is at its peak; it is the Golden Age of
    Man. The Terran Mandate has largely given up on exerting control
    over the frontier colonies, and now concentrates simply on
    neutralizing threats to the core worlds. Every description of human
    civilization and ideology can be found somewhere in human space, and
    cultures experiment with new forms of social organization. Psitech
    supplements normal technology to produce enormous abundance for even
    the poorest worlds with access to core technology.

-   ***2460:*** Human gengineering becomes common on some worlds as
    societies attempt to improve their members. Advances in longevity
    and health spread widely, but attempts to significantly improve
    human capabilities invariably bring serious drawbacks from system
    strain and unanticipated side effects. Still, some of the more
    zealous cultures are willing to accept these consequences in pursuit
    of the “perfect human”.

-   ***2500:*** Jump Gates begin to reach the frontier. Major systems are
    the first to receive them, while most of the minor worlds are still
    reliant on spike drive ships. The furthest reaches of the frontier
    now extend ten years of spike drive travel from Earth. Population
    growth levels off and begins to decline with the increasing wealth
    of the colonies and their progressive self-absorption.

-   ***2550:*** Certain remote sectors of space have begun to embrace both
    gengineering and advanced AI integration to recreate humanity in
    ways more suitable to local ambitions. Some of these sectors
    continue to interact with their baseline human neighbors, while
    other transhumans are dangerously aggressive in their
    proselytization.

-   ***2600:*** Spike drive ships are now somewhat antiquated, serving a
    vastly reduced exploratory effort and as militia ships for the
    defense of local systems. Almost all core systems of importance are
    now linked with jump gates. Psitech has permeated even very basic
    technology on these worlds. Large-scale war between worlds is almost
    unknown.

-   ***2665:*** The Scream erupts from somewhere within the Veil
    Nebula. Reconstructions of the event suggest that it was some form
    of faster-than-light psychic emanation, the wave propagating from
    one end of human space to the other within seventeen minutes. The
    Scream inevitably rendered a psychic either dead or hopelessly
    insane. The Jump Gate network collapses. A period of stellar
    isolation and chaos begins, now commonly called “the Silence”.

-   ***2665:*** On Earth, the maddened arch-psions known as the Crazed
    annihilate the planet's infrastructure, destroy many AI Maestros,
    and pervert the Highshine nanite recovery system. The solar system's
    defense grid is activated and made universally hostile to all
    starships. Earth vanishes from all surviving records, its present
    condition unknown.

-   ***2700:*** Countless core worlds die as they are cut off from vital
    food and technical supplies. Psitech manufactories are crippled, and
    only a relative handful of spike drive ships can be fabricated
    before the industrial base erodes. These ships band together for
    security while searching for resupply and become the progenitors of
    today's Scavenger Fleets.

-   ***2705:*** Frontier worlds fare better than core planets. More spike
    drive ships are available, and those worlds that have yet to receive
    Jump Gates were still devoting effort to autonomous agriculture and
    industry. Even so, the sudden loss of every human psychic leaves
    their psitech equipment and industries largely useless. Many
    frontier worlds devolve to survival-level subsistence.

-   ***2710:*** The last easily-salvaged remnants of Mandate pretech begin
    to wear out or become used up. The most useful or effective tech was
    often explicitly designed to be irreplaceable by frontier worlds in
    order to maintain the Mandate core's monopoly on the
    technology. With the core worlds dead or consumed by struggle, this
    technology can now be found only in lost caches and Mandate
    ruins. Some worlds go to desperate extremes to maintain vital
    pretech infrastructure, utilizing dangerous methods or unstable
    repurposed tech.

-   ***2900:*** Attempts are made to recover the techniques of psychic
    training. The complete absence of any experienced psychic trainers
    hampers this effort, and the cost in psychic lives to recreate this
    training is enormous. A few worlds are successful in developing
    crude training programs, but most societies abandon the effort in
    the face of more immediate planetary needs.

-   ***3050:*** The Silence starts to lift. Those worlds that did not
    experience a terminal collapse after the Scream finally begin to
    perfect techniques of large-scale manufacturing that do not rely on
    psitech. Even the most sophisticated training programs can no longer
    replicate the narrow and esoteric talents of pre-Silence psychic
    fabricators.

-   ***3100:*** Spike drive ships begin the remapping of drill courses
    between stars. With almost five centuries of neglect, the
    pre-Silence rutters have become useless. The steady shifting of
    dimensional layers has rendered old course soundings dangerously
    inaccurate. All of the drill courses must be rediscovered through
    trial and potentially fatal error. Few Scavenger Fleets cooperate in
    sharing their course data due to fears of competition.

-   ***3150:*** Stellar unions start to form around the strongest
    worlds. Exploration continues, often in the hands of small traders
    and scout crews who are willing to risk all for the chance to open a
    route to an unplundered tomb world. Warfare erupts between unions
    contesting control over lost worlds and space installations.

-   ***3200:*** The present day.

# SECTOR CREATION

Every self-respecting sci-fi game needs to be able to provide a stock
of interesting alien worlds. Even if a campaign should happen to take
place largely on a single world, the backdrop of foreign spheres adds
context and additional adventure hooks to the game.

Most campaigns are going to involve substantial world-hopping,
however, and the GM needs to be ready to deal with this. This chapter
will give you the tools you need to fashion a sector of the void that
will be worth the reckless daring of a band of heroic PCs.


<a id="the-nature-of-sectors"></a>

## The Nature of Sectors

In the former days of the Mandate, human space was generally divided
into administrative sectors, each one the particular responsibility of
some fragment of the ancient Terran bureaucracy. By the end of the
Second Wave, these responsibilities were almost entirely fictitious,
as the Mandate Fleet lacked the manpower necessary to exert Old
Earth's will on its scattered progeny. Even so, the centuries-old
grind of bureaucratic procedure still dutifully labeled each fragment
of distant space with its own identity.

Sectors were established on the basis of metadimensional proximity
rather than simple spatial propinquity. Individual stars in a sector
might be spread out over dozens of light years, but the
metadimensional currents between them were strong enough to allow
quick travel among them, when a physically-neighboring star might
require impossibly lengthy drills through metadimensional space to
reach it.

Settlers in these far sectors often adopted Mandate sector
nomenclature simply out of convenience. The sectors that Fleet scout
ships and far trader adventurers mapped out were composed of stars
“close” enough to allow for trade with their ramshackle spike drives
and colonial cargo haulers, and their density allowed for trade and
assistance between nearby friendly worlds. Those with a more
isolationist bent sought out sectors with far-scattered stars that
couldn't be bridged by the less sophisticated drives that most
colonists used.

Most sectors had limited contact with other regions of space. While
“bordering” stars could sometimes allow drills into a neighboring
sector, large patches of unfriendly metadimensional space often
strictly limited the available paths into or out of a sector. Some
sectors were entirely inaccessible by anything but top-grade Mandate
spike drives capable of leaping the broad gaps around them, and some
entire regions were isolated by a few narrow bridgepoints into the
cluster.

As a consequence, modern human space varies wildly in every respect.
Some regions have sophisticated interstellar trade and wide-reaching
empires, while others are struggling to rise from primitive barbarism.
A lost bridgepoint can separate whole empires, leaving both entirely
ignorant of each other&#x2026;for the moment.


<a id="sectors-in-your-game"></a>

## Sectors In Your Game

From a campaign perspective, sectors limit the scope of material you
need to take into account in your game. While it's perfectly possible
to run a game with multiple interconnected sectors, the sheer bulk of
worlds can make that a painful prospect for most GMs. A single sector
of 21-30 worlds is more than enough for most parties to explore.

Sectors and interstellar regions also provide you with a convenient
explanation for running dramatically different campaigns. Players who
want to run a space-operatic game set in a region of easy spaceflight
and consistent high-tech marvels can do so, while a group that wants a
harder scifi experience in a sector without psionic powers or exotic
energy weapons can have their play as well. The vast sweep of human
space has room for your preferred tropes without having to fight the
setting. No matter what you want to play, there's *some* chunk of
human space that has it.

A sector provides the basic background for the adventures the PCs
encounter, as every world needs to have some kind of adventure-worthy
content if it's to justify its drain on a GM's creativity and focus.
Creating worlds purely for pleasure or aesthetic satisfaction is
entirely valid, but as a working GM, you also need material you can
*play*. This chapter will show you how to maximize the return on your
effort, and get the most playable content out of the least amount of
work.

This is a necessity in any system, but it is especially important if
you're going to be running a sandbox game. A GM who tries to flesh out
every nook and cranny of the dozens of worlds they create will be
rapidly exhausted by the effort, and might still lack the content they
need to actually run a game during the next session of play. A GM
needs to have a plan and an appropriate set of tools if they are to
deal with the challenge in a comfortable, straightforward way.

When building a sector, you can generally assume that it's isolated
from any neighboring regions. There might be a few connections along
the “borders” of the sector, still-remembered spike drive paths into
the next collection of worlds, but you've got enough to build if you
just focus on a single sector at a time.

You are advised to carefully read the following pages and take heed of
the advice on how much content you should create for each world. A GM
would not be a GM if they did not take pleasure in creating wondrous
new worlds to explore, but the most enthusiastic demiurge still has a
limited amount of creative energy, time, and focus to spend on a
campaign. If you follow the steps in the following pages, you'll be
able to ensure a playable amount of gaming content for your next
session before you start spending your effort on more decorative
elements of your creation.


<a id="creating-a-stellar-sector"></a>

## Creating a Stellar Sector

Once you've decided to forge your own piece of the infinite void,
you'll want to grab a sheet of largehex hex paper from one of the many
templates available online. First you'll make a stellar map of the
sector on this sheet, and then you'll individually flesh out the
worlds to whatever degree of fineness your needs require.

One crucial thing to remember at this stage of creation is that *you
do not have to create everything*. You don't need to answer every
question about the sector or have every world in adventure-ready
condition. Right now you're just laying down broad strokes and rough
colors to the sector, and when it comes time to do detail work you'll
save it for the worlds that matter most to your immediate needs.

Every GM has a limited supply of time, energy, and creative
inspiration. If you try to fabricate an entire complete sector in one
go, with interesting planets and meaningful interstellar intrigue and
easy adventure hooks all over the place, you're likely to exhaust
yourself before you even get to play.

Instead, you should follow a simple guiding principle whenever
building anything for your campaign, whether a stellar sector or an
adventure outline.

***Am I having fun?*** If you're enjoying yourself, then you can keep
building. We follow this hobby because it's fun, and if you're
enjoying the process then you should let yourself have your
indulgence.

***Am I going to need this for the next session?*** If what you're
creating is something you know you're going to need for the next game
session, then you should finish it. Don't let this feeling of
obligation extend to every detail, however; it can be easy to imagine
situations where you'll need to elaborate some NPC or organization or
location, but if you respond to every such possibility you'll never
get away from the drawing board.

If you're not having fun and you don't need it for your next game
session, *stop it*. You're going to exhaust yourself on minutiae and
trivia and not have the energy to do the parts you really do need, or
the vigor needed to actually run this for the group.

With that principle kept firmly in mind, it's time to start building
the sector.


<a id="place-the-stars"></a>

## Place the Stars

The standard sector map is a grid of hexagons 8 wide by 10 high, with
hex templates easily acquired from the net. Roll 1d10 and add 20 to
determine the total number of stars in the sector, or simply choose a
number that suits.

For the first twenty or so stars, roll 1d8 and 1d10 together to
determine the column and row in which to place the star. If the hex is
already occupied, place it adjacent in the direction of the nearest
edge.

Some columns have “half-hexes” in them, and only 9 full hexes; if you
roll a 10 for such a column, either reroll or place it at the
bottom-most full hex.

Once you've placed the randomly-positioned stars, add the remainder to
connect any stellar clumps or groupings. Remember that standard
postech spike drives can't reach more than 3 hexes, so any cluster
that can't be reached with such a drill will be inaccessible to
anything but pretech-grade drives.

The stellar map you've just created is an abstraction, one reflecting
the eddies and currents of metadimensional space. The individual stars
might look adjacent on the map, but some may be vast distances
apart. If you'd prefer to use more realistic star maps, you can grab
some three-dimensional star map off the web and convert a convenient
number of light years into a single “hex” of distance for spike drive
purposes.


<a id="lay-down-the-primary-worlds"></a>

## Lay Down the Primary Worlds

With the stars placed, it's time to place the primary inhabited
worlds. While it's possible to declare that a star is orbited only by
barren rocks, such stars are more difficult to make useful as places
of adventure and gameable fun.

Right now, assume that each inhabited system has a single primary
world. The original colonists would have naturally sought out the
best, most habitable world for their founding. As a consequence,
however nasty the primary world is, the others in the system are
probably even worse. If you wish to add additional planets to the
system later, you can do so, but for now you'll want to focus on just
one.

Start by rolling two world tags for each planet. World tags are simple
tropes that reflect the most important qualities about the world, or
at least those qualities most important to adventurers. A list of a
hundred potential world tags starts here.

It's most convenient to roll world tags for each planet before moving
on to the other elements of the world, so you spend less time flipping
back and forth between the sections. Don't worry about making the tags
make sense yet. Just note them down and go on.

Next, roll the atmospheres for each world. In this and the following
steps, you can either reroll results that make no sense in light of
the world tags you've generated, or simply pick a result that fits. If
you're feeling more adventurous, however, you can try to think of an
explanation that reconciles seemingly incommensurate results.

After you roll atmospheres for each planet, repeat the process for
temperature, biosphere, population, and tech level. Optionally, you can
go on to add additional planets or points of interest to each system.

Finally, tack on a name for the planet and give it a sentence worth of
description. You don't need to flesh it out fully right now. Just note
down whatever rough idea of it comes to mind from its world tags,
population, and other planetary qualities.


<a id="mark-polities-and-trade-routes"></a>

## Mark Polities and Trade Routes

Identify the star systems that are in contact with each other and draw
lines of communication between them. Remember that any gap of 4 or
more hexes can't be crossed without pretech spike drives, so any
contact between distant clusters will have to be through an
intermediate world.

Worlds in contact with each other may not necessarily be friendly, but
they do know about each other and have at least a basic understanding
of local conditions. Some provision is usually made for foreign
visitors from these other worlds, even if it's nothing more than a
strictly-monitored starport housing unit.

If two or more planets seem like they ought to belong to the same
interstellar polity, sketch out a “border” around the grouping. Most
TL4 worlds would be very hard-pressed to mount an effective
interstellar invasion of a peer world, so these polities have likely
formed out of diplomatic or cultural ties, or consist of a local
hegemon exerting its rule over planets too weak or primitive to resist
their influence.

Many sectors will have no multi-system governments of any kind. The
individual worlds might be too independent, or the recovery of
spaceflight technology may have been too recent to allow for ties of
mutual governance to form yet. Such disjointed sectors can make life
easier for the typical band of PCs, as escape into a new system means
escape from the legal jurisdiction of a world they may have recently
offended.


<a id="build-out-the-important-worlds"></a>

## Build Out the Important Worlds

Most of the worlds in your sector don't need anything more than what
you've already given them. A few worlds need more elaborate detail,
however, and for these you'll want to make use of a separate planetary
record sheet for the world.

Only detail worlds that you're going to need for the next session. In
this case, that means you should detail the world that the campaign
starts on and those worlds that the PCs might end up traveling to at
the end of the first session. For most purposes, this just means the
starting world and its immediate neighbors.

First, pick a rough cultural template for the world. Maybe it has a
Latin American flavor, or was founded by Russian colonists, or was an
outpost of Byzantine Empire enthusiasts. This culture has doubtless
changed drastically since its initial founding, but it gives you a
baseline for assigning names to people and places, identifying the
common language spoken on the planet, and giving you enough
information to describe local foods, architectural styles, and small
slice-of-life elements.

You can always take the time to create an entirely new hybrid culture,
but whatever you make or choose should be clear enough in your mind to
let you give quick answers to sudden questions about cultural values
or local habits. Again, it's not critical to worry about historical
accuracy; these worlds have had centuries to form their own worldviews
and local customs.

Next, use the world tags to create adventure components. Each tag
includes different example Enemies, Friends, Complications, Things,
and Places. Take an Enemy from both world tags or create one for each,
and merge them together into a single antagonist. Thus, a *Feral
World* with *Heavy Industry* might have a cannibal oligarch who
literally lives on the flesh and blood of his slave laborers. Give
this Enemy a name and a sentence of description.

Repeat the process for a Friend, a Complication, a Thing, and a Place.
You don't necessarily need to use both tags in every instance, and
you'll likely want to make up your own components inspired by the
tags, but you should have at least one item in each category written
down on the planetary record. You'll use these raw elements later to
create a starting adventure for your band of star-faring freebooters.

Lastly, take a few minutes to answer some critical questions about the
planet, noting the answers down in the cultural section of the sheet.

What does this world have that the PCs might care about? Does it
export a valuable and portable commodity, or provide a special tech,
or have unique job opportunities for expendable offworlder
adventurers?

What is the biggest conflict on the world right now? Is it a social
struggle between classes, tension with offworlder merchants or
visitors, a war going on among local governments, or some other big
crisis? Every world should have at least one obvious conflict that the
PCs might choose to engage or be pulled into.

What do they think about outsiders? Are they comfortable with
offworlders, do they view them with unusual mistrust, or are they
outright xenophobic?

What is law enforcement like? Are there special laws that might tangle
the PCs? If the PCs break a law, what kind of enforcement can they
expect?

Where do the PCs land? What's the name of the major starport on the
world, and does the starport have any special deficiencies or unique
opportunities?

You can flesh out a world beyond these questions if you wish, but they
provide a bare minimum of data.


<a id="choose-factions-and-relations"></a>

## Choose Factions and Relations

Lastly, look at what you've created and determine the relationships
between the starting world and its neighbors. Also, decide on the
relationships between any polities you've established. Open
interstellar warfare is very hard for a lone TL4 world to sustain, but
a powerful planet or combine might be able to do it. More likely are
cold wars of spies and saboteurs.

You may decide to establish one or more Factions to help give some
independent motion to the sector's background. Two or three Factions
are plenty for the start of a campaign, and you should feel free to
make new ones or let old ones fall inactive as the game progresses.
Rules for Factions start here.

And with that, your sector is ready for play. The Adventure Creation
chapter gives the next step.


<a id="assigning-world-tags"></a>

## Assigning World Tags

The first step in world creation, and perhaps the most important, lies
in assigning “tags” to the world. Tags are brief conceptual tropes
that set the world off from planets of otherwise similar population
and characteristics. You can either pick from the tag table to select
qualities that sound interesting for a world, or else roll percentile
dice to select them randomly.

In general, you should pick or roll two tags for any given
world. Using a single tag can leave a planet feeling somewhat flat and
one-dimensional, while using three or more can end up muddying the
feel of the world. The goal of the tags is not to automatically
combine into some intricately sophisticated world model, but to
provide some clear, bright elements to relate to the PCs. Tags can
randomly give you “desert planet torn by civil war”, from which you
can then create “an arid world riven by factional disputes between
fragmented clans, the families based around ownership of irreplaceable
pre-Scream moisture collectors”.

Tags are meant to simplify your life as a GM. They provide quick,
simple hooks for adventure and cultural characterization to help
distinguish the myriad worlds of your campaign from each other.

Each tag includes associated entries for ***Enemies***, ***Friends***,
***Complications***, - ***Things***, and ***Places*** that fit with that
tag. GMs can combine the elements of the two tags to create ones
flavored specifically for that world. For example, two random tags for
a world might be “Regional Hegemon” and “Psionics Fear”. Combining the
“Colonial Official” and “Mental Purity Investigator” entries from the
enemies lists of those tags, we come up with Heinrich Stalt, Imperial
Mind Proctor, a grim inquisitor dispatched to the worlds under
Imperial “protection” to purge them of the awful curse of
psionically-active monsters.

These NPCs, objects, places, and situations can be used as raw grist
for generating your adventures or be slotted into the scenario seeds
provided later in the Adventure Generation chapter. Of course, not
every Enemy will be intrinsically hostile to the PCs, nor every Friend
necessarily a sympathetic figure.

Naturally, you should feel free to come up with your own tags as well.
Almost any science-fiction trope that you enjoy can be turned into a
tag, and characteristic elements can be blended into the list of raw
adventure components.

## Abandoned Colony

The world once hosted a colony, whether human or otherwise, until some
crisis or natural disaster drove the inhabitants away or killed them
off. The colony might have been mercantile in nature, an expedition to
extract valuable local resources, or it might have been a reclusive
cabal of zealots. The remains of the colony are usually in ruins, and
might still be dangerous from the aftermath of whatever destroyed it
in the first place.


<a id="orga860ddc"></a>

### Enemies

Crazed survivors, Ruthless plunderers of the ruins, Automated defense
system


<a id="org0bd5ca3"></a>

### Friends

Inquisitive stellar archaeologist, Heir to the colony's property,
Local wanting the place cleaned out and made safe


<a id="orgddbe7e9"></a>

### Complications

The local government wants the ruins to remain a secret, The locals
claim ownership of it, The colony is crumbling and dangerous to
navigate


<a id="org597ac4c"></a>

### Things

Long-lost property deeds, Relic stolen by the colonists when they
left, Historical record of the colonization attempt


<a id="org59b8f75"></a>

### Places

Decaying habitation block, Vine-covered town square, Structure buried
by an ancient landslide


<a id="tag-altered-humanity"></a>

## Altered Humanity

The humans on this world are visibly and drastically different from
normal humanity. They may have additional limbs, new sensory organs,
or other significant changes. Were these from ancestral eugenic
manipulation, strange stellar mutations, or from an environmental
toxin unique to this world?


<a id="org0e13cac"></a>

### Enemies

Biochauvinist local, Local experimenter, Mentally unstable mutant


<a id="org8327ec4"></a>

### Friends

Local seeking a “cure”, Curious xenophiliac, Anthropological researcher


<a id="org7283128"></a>

### Complications

survival, Locals fear and mistrust non-local humans


<a id="org082f794"></a>

### Things

Alteration is contagious, Alteration is necessary for long-term
Original pretech mutagenic equipment, Valuable biological byproduct
from the mutants, “Cure” for the altered genes, Record of the original
colonial genotypes


<a id="orgb4e2a95"></a>

### Places

Abandoned eugenics laboratory, An environment requiring the mutation
for survival, A sacred site where the first local was transformed


<a id="tag-alien-ruins"></a>

## Alien Ruins

The world has significant alien ruins present. The locals may or may
not permit others to investigate the ruins, and may make it difficult
to remove any objects of value without substantial payment. Any
surviving ruins with worthwhile salvage almost certainly have some
defense or hazard to explain their unplundered state.


<a id="orgd8eca87"></a>

### Enemies

Customs inspector, Worshipper of the ruins, Hidden alien survivor


<a id="org70f14ba"></a>

### Friends

Curious scholar, Avaricious local resident, Interstellar smuggler

ruins


<a id="org16997de"></a>

### Places

Undersea ruin, Orbital ruin, Perfectly preserved alien building, Alien
mausoleum


<a id="tag-anarchists"></a>

## Anarchists

Rather than being an incidental anarchy of struggling tribes and
warring factions, this world actually has a functional society with no
centralized authority. Authority might be hyper-localized to extended
families, specific religious parishes, or voluntary associations. Some
force is preventing an outside group or internal malcontents from
coalescing into a power capable of imposing its rule on the locals;
this force might be an ancient pretech defense system, a benevolent
military AI, or the sheer obscurity and isolation of the culture.


<a id="org01eb87d"></a>

### Enemies

Offworlder imperialist, Reformer seeking to impose “good government”,
Exploiter taking advantage of the lack of centralized resistance


<a id="org3bbd66a"></a>

### Friends

Proud missionary for anarchy, Casual local free spirit, Curious
offworlder political scientist


<a id="org5daed79"></a>

### Complications

The anarchistic structure is compelled by an external power, The
anarchy is enabled by currently abundant resources, The protecting
force that shelters the anarchy is waning


<a id="org01d7ef8"></a>

### Things

A macguffin that would let the possessor enforce their rule on others,
A vital resource needed to preserve general liberty, Tech forbidden as
disruptive to the social order


<a id="org518794c"></a>

### Places

Community of similar-sized homes, Isolated clan homestead, Automated
mining site


<a id="tag-anthropomorphs"></a>

## Anthropomorphs

The locals were originally human, but at some point became
anthropomorphic, either as an ancient furry colony, a group of
animal-worshiping sectarians, or gengineers who just happened to find
animal elements most convenient for surviving on the world. Depending
on the skill of the original gengineers, their feral forms may or may
not work as well as their original human bodies, or may come with
drawbacks inherited from their animal elements.


<a id="orgb1b93f9"></a>

### Enemies

Anthro-supremacist local, Native driven by feral urges, Outside
exploiter who sees the locals as subhuman creatures


<a id="org3c88a9f"></a>

### Friends

Fascinated genetic researcher, Diplomat trained to deal with normals,
Local needing outside help


<a id="orgcfff09c"></a>

### Complications

The locals consider their shapes a curse from their foolish ancestors,
Society is ordered according to animal forms, The locals view normal
humans as repulsive or inferior


<a id="org1293e0c"></a>

### Things

Pretech gengineering tech, A “cure” that may not be wanted, Sacred
feral totem


<a id="org397862f"></a>

### Places

Shrine to a feral deity, Nature preserve suited to an
animal type, Living site built to take advantage of animal traits


<a id="tag-area-51"></a>

## Area 51

The world's government is fully aware of their local stellar
neighbors, but the common populace has no idea about it- and the
government means to keep it that way. Trade with government officials
in remote locations is possible, but any attempt to clue the commoners
in on the truth will be met with lethal reprisals.


<a id="org3dccd77"></a>

### Enemies

Suspicious government minder, Free merchant who likes his local
monopoly, Local who wants a specimen for dissection


<a id="org465733a"></a>

### Friends

Crusading offworld investigator, Conspiracy-theorist local, Idealistic
government reformer


<a id="org3e25a06"></a>

### Complications

The government has a good reason to keep the truth concealed, The
government ruthlessly oppresses the natives, The government is
actually composed of offworlders


<a id="org5cff784"></a>

### Things

Elaborate spy devices, Memory erasure tech, Possessions of the last
offworlder who decided to spread the truth


<a id="org32c113e"></a>

### Places

Desert airfield, Deep subterranean bunker, Hidden mountain valley


<a id="tag-badlands-world"></a>

## Badlands World

Whatever the original climate and atmosphere type, something horrible
happened to this world. Biological, chemical, or nanotechnical
weaponry has reduced it to a wretched hellscape. Some local life might
still be able to survive on its blasted surface, usually at some dire
cost in health or humanity.


<a id="orgd448ccd"></a>

### Enemies

Mutated badlands fauna, Desperate local, Badlands raider chief


<a id="org33a500b"></a>

### Friends

<a id="orga3ad111"></a>

### Places

Untouched oasis, Ruined city, Salt flat


<a id="tag-beastmasters"></a>

## Beastmasters

The natives have extremely close bonds with the local fauna, possibly
having special means of communication and control through tech or
gengineering. Local animal life plays a major role in their society,
industry, or warfare, and new kinds of beasts may be bred to suit
their purposes.


<a id="org64baaac"></a>

### Enemies

Half-feral warlord of a beast swarm, Coldly inhuman scientist, Altered
beast with human intellect and furious malice


<a id="org83340ac"></a>

### Friends

Native bonded with an adorable animal, Herder of very useful beasts,
Animal-revering mystic

### Complications

The “animals” are very heavily gengineered humans, The animals
actually run the society, The animals have the same rights as humans


<a id="org574f773"></a>

### Things

Tech used to alter animal life, A plague vial that could wipe out the
animals, A pretech device that can perform a wonder if operated by a
beast


<a id="org0211293"></a>

### Places

Park designed as a comfortable home for beasts, Public plaza designed
to accommodate animal companions, Factory full of animal workers


<a id="tag-battleground"></a>

## Battleground

The world is a battleground for two or more outside powers. They may
be interstellar rivals, or groups operating out of orbitals or other
system bodies. Something about the planet is valuable enough for them
to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be anything but animate
obstacles to the fight.


<a id="org5a419cc"></a>

### Enemies

Ruthless military commander, Looter pack chieftain, Traitorous
collaborator


<a id="org3c30ca4"></a>

### Friends

Native desperately seeking protection, Pragmatic military officer,

### Things

A cache of the resource the invaders seek, Abandoned prototype
military gear, Precious spy intelligence lost by someone


<a id="org1236f22"></a>

### Places

Artillery-pocked wasteland, Reeking refugee camp, Burnt-out shell of a
city


<a id="tag-bubble-cities"></a>

## Bubble Cities

Whether due to a lack of atmosphere or an uninhabitable climate, the
world's cities exist within domes or pressurized buildings. In such
sealed environments, techniques of surveillance and control can grow
baroque and extreme.


<a id="org0e27d2e"></a>

### Enemies

Native dreading outsider contamination, Saboteur from another bubble
city, Local official hostile to outsider ignorance of laws


<a id="org7788edb"></a>

### Friends

Local rebel against the city officials, Maintenance chief in need of
help, Surveyor seeking new building sites

### Things

Pretech habitat technology, Valuable industrial products, Master key
codes to a city's security system


<a id="orgd9c1afe"></a>

### Places

City power core, Surface of the bubble, Hydroponics complex,
Warren-like hab block


<a id="tag-cheap-life"></a>

## Cheap Life

Human life is near-worthless on this world. Ubiquitous cloning, local
conditions that ensure early death, a culture that reveres murder, or
a social structure that utterly discounts the value of most human
lives ensures that death is the likely outcome for any action that
irritates someone consequential.


<a id="org8e90927"></a>

### Enemies

Master assassin, Bloody-handed judge, Overseer of disposable clones


<a id="org6bfc602"></a>

### Friends

Endearing local whose life the PCs accidentally bought, Escapee from
death seeking outside help, Reformer trying to change local mores

### Things

Device that revives or re-embodies the dead, Maltech engine fueled by
human life, Priceless treasure held by a now-dead owner


<a id="org98b9e08"></a>

### Places

Thronging execution ground, extremely cursory cemetery, Factory full
of lethal dangers that could be corrected easily


<a id="tag-cold-war"></a>

## Cold War

Two or more great powers control the planet, and they have a hostility
to each other that's just barely less than open warfare. The hostility
might be ideological in nature, or it might revolve around control of
some local resource.


<a id="orgf2a5db9"></a>

### Enemies

Suspicious chief of intelligence, Native who thinks the outworlders
are with the other side, Femme fatale


<a id="orgc5f056d"></a>

### Places

Seedy bar in a neutral area, Political rally, Isolated area where
fighting is underway


<a id="tag-civil-war"></a>

## Civil War

The world is currently torn between at least two opposing factions,
all of which claim legitimacy. The war may be the result of a
successful rebel uprising against tyranny, or it might just be the
result of schemers who plan to be the new masters once the revolution
is complete.


<a id="org7b2cd14"></a>

### Enemies

Faction commissar, Angry native, Conspiracy theorist who blames
offworlders for the war, Deserter looking out for himself, Guerrilla

### Places

Battle front, Bombed-out town, Rear-area red light zone, Propaganda
broadcast tower


<a id="tag-colonized-population"></a>

## Colonized Population

A neighboring world has successfully colonized this less-advanced or
less-organized planet, and the natives aren't happy about it. A puppet
government may exist, but all real decisions are made by the local
viceroy.


<a id="org9a0b3e4"></a>

### Enemies

Suspicious security personnel, worlder-hating natives, Local crime
boss preying on rich offworlders


<a id="orgb8ef960"></a>

### Friends

Native resistance leader, Colonial official seeking help, Native

Deep wilderness resistance camp, City district off-limits to natives,
Colonial labor site


<a id="tag-cultural-power"></a>

## Cultural Power

The world is a considerable cultural power in the sector, producing
music, art, philosophy, or some similar intangible that their
neighbors find irresistibly attractive. Other worlds might have a
profound degree of cultural cachet as the inheritor of some venerable
artistic tradition.


<a id="org2232539"></a>

### Enemies

Murderously eccentric artist, Crazed fan, Failed artist with an
obsessive grudge, Critic with a crusade to enact


<a id="org0226d6f"></a>

### Friends

Struggling young artist, Pupil of the artistic tradition, Scholar of
the art, Offworlder hating the source of corrupting alien ways


<a id="orga5917a3"></a>

### Complications

The art is slowly lethal to its masters, The art is mentally or
physically addictive, The art is a fragment of ancient technical or
military science


<a id="orgc5028c9"></a>

### Things

The instrument of a legendary master, The only copy of a dead master's
opus, Proof of intellectual property ownership


<a id="org467b972"></a>

### Places

Recording or performance studio, Public festival choked with tourists,
Monument to a dead master of the art


<a id="tag-cyborgs"></a>

## Cyborgs

The planet's population makes heavy use of cybernetics, with many of
the inhabitants possessing at least a cosmetic amount of chrome. This
may be the result of a strong local cyber tech base, a religious
injunction, or simply a necessary measure to survive the local
conditions.


<a id="orgfe430a3"></a>

### Enemies

Ambitious hacker of cyber implants, Cybertech oligarch, Researcher
craving fresh offworlders, Cybered-up gang boss


<a id="org069a6fc"></a>

### Places

Grimy slum chop-shop, Bloody lair of implant rippers, Stark plaza
where everyone is seeing things through their augmented-re ality cyber


<a id="tag-cybercommunists"></a>

## Cybercommunists

On this world communism actually works, thanks to pretech computing
devices and greater or lesser amounts of psychic precognition. Central
planning nodes direct all production and employment on the
world. Citizens in good standing have access to ample amounts of
material goods for all needs and many wants. Instead of strife over
wealth, conflicts erupt over political controls, cultural precepts, or
control over the planning nodes. Many cybercommunist worlds show a
considerable bias toward the private interests of those who run the
planning nodes.


<a id="orgcfc8c46"></a>

### Enemies

Embittered rebel against perceived unfairness, Offworlder saboteur,
Aspiring Stalin-figure


<a id="org237491f"></a>

### Friends

Idealistic planning node tech, Cynical anti-corruption cop,
Precognitive economist


<a id="org0c7f535"></a>

works because the locals have been mentally or physically altered, The
planning computers can't handle the increasing population within the
system


<a id="org01f4889"></a>

### Things

Planning node computer, Wildly destabilizing commodity that can't be
factored into plans, A tremendous store of valuables made by accident


<a id="org9b0e4b7"></a>

### Places

Humming factory, Apartment block of per fectly equal flats, Mass
demonstration of unity


<a id="tag-cyclical-doom"></a>

## Cyclical Doom

The world regularly suffers some apocalyptic catastrophe that wipes
out organized civilization on it. The local culture is aware of this
cycle and has traditions to ensure a fragment of civilization survives
into the next era, but these traditions don't always work properly,
and sometimes dangerous fragments of the past emerge.


<a id="org937164c"></a>

### Enemies

Offworlder seeking to trigger the apocalypse early for profit, Local
recklessly taking advantage of preparation stores, Demagogue claiming
the cycle is merely a myth of the authorities


<a id="orgc019435"></a>

### Friends

Local threatened by perils of the cycle's initial stages


<a id="orgd9b7d3b"></a>

### Complications

The cycles really are a myth of the authorities, The cycles are
controlled by alien constructs, An outside power is interfering with
preparation


<a id="org5e27b17"></a>

### Things

A lost cache of ancient treasures, Tech or archives that will pinpoint
the cycle's timing, Keycodes to bypass an ancient vault's security


<a id="org8be9f1e"></a>

### Places

Lethally-defended vault of forgotten secrets, Starport crowded with
panicked refugees, Town existing in the shadow of some mon strous
monument to a former upheaval


<a id="tag-desert-world"></a>

## Desert World

The world may have a breathable atmosphere and a human-tolerable
temperature range, but it is an arid, stony waste outside of a few
places made habitable by human effort. The deep wastes are largely
unexplored and inhabited by outcasts and worse.


<a id="orgad0a26d"></a>

### Enemies

Raider chieftain, Crazed hermit, Angry

equipment


<a id="org5132d05"></a>

### Places

Oasis, “The Empty Quarter” of the desert, Hidden underground cistern


<a id="tag-dying-race"></a>

## Dying Race

The inhabitants of this world are dying out, and they know it. Through
environmental toxins, hostile bio-weapons, or sheer societal despair,
the culture cannot replenish its numbers. Members seek meaning in
their own strange goals or peculiar faiths, though a few might
struggle to find some way to reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.


<a id="org2a5f467"></a>

### Enemies

Hostile outsider who wants the locals dead, Offworlder seeking to take
advantage of their weakened state, Invaders eager to push the locals
out of their former lands

### Friends

One of the few youth among the population, Determined and hopeful
reformer, Researcher seeking a new method of reproduction


<a id="org98a59eb"></a>

### Complications

necessary to prevent some grand catastrophe, The race is somehow
convinced they deserve this fate


<a id="orga31d21a"></a>

### Things

Extremely valuable reproductive tech, Treasured artifacts of the
former age, Bioweapon used on the race


<a id="orgc89a298"></a>

### Places

City streets devoid of pedestrians, Mighty edifice now crumbling with
disrepair, Small dwelling full of people in a town now otherwise empty


<a id="tag-doomed-world"></a>

## Doomed World

The world is doomed, and the locals may or may not know it. Some
cosmic catastrophe looms before them, and the locals have no realistic
way to get everyone to safety. To the extent that the public is aware,
society is disintegrating into a combination of religious fervor,
abject hedonism, and savage violence.


<a id="org79f1de8"></a>

### Enemies

Crazed prophet of a false salvation, Ruthless leader seeking to flee
with their treasures, Cynical ship captain selling a one-way trip into
hard vacuum as escape to another world

Orgiastic celebration involving sex and murder in equal parts, Holy
site full of desperate petitioners to the divine


<a id="tag-eugenic-cult"></a>

## Eugenic Cult

Even in the days before the Silence, major improvement of the human
genome always seemed to come with unacceptable side-effects. Some
worlds host secret cults that perpetuate these improvements regardless
of the cost, and a few planets have been taken over entirely by the
cults.


<a id="orga59668f"></a>

### Enemies

place infiltrated by cult sympathizers


<a id="tag-exchange-consulate"></a>

## Exchange Consulate

The Exchange of Light once served as the largest, most trusted banking

worlds retain a functioning Exchange Consulate where banking services
and arbitration can be arranged.

<a id="tag-fallen-hegemon"></a>

## Fallen Hegemon

At some point in the past, this world was a hegemonic power over some
or all of the sector, thanks to superior tech, expert diplomacy, the
weakness of their neighbors, or inherited Mandate legitimacy. Some
kind of crash or revolt broke their power, however, and now the world
is littered with the wreckage of former glory.


<a id="org90da6a8"></a>

### Enemies

of empire, Vengeful offworlder seeking to punish their old rulers


<a id="orgc0e1b1e"></a>

### Friends

Realistic local leader trying to hold things together, Scholar of past
glories, Refugee from an overthrown colonial enclave


<a id="org3de90c0"></a>

### Complications

The hegemon's rule was enlightened and fair, It collapsed due to its
own internal strife rather than external resistance, It pretends that
nothing has happened to its power, It's been counter-colonized by
vengeful outsiders


<a id="orgeb2c00d"></a>

### Things

Precious insignia of former rule, Relic tech important to its power,
Plundered colonial artifact


<a id="org97078a4"></a>

### Places

Palace far too grand for its current occupant, Oversized spaceport now
in disrepair, Boulevard lined with monuments to past glories


<a id="tag-feral-world"></a>

## Feral World

In the long, isolated night of the Silence, some worlds have
experienced total moral and cultural collapse. Whatever remains has
been twisted beyond recognition into assorted death cults, xenophobic
fanaticism, horrific cultural practices, or other behavior
unacceptable on more enlightened worlds. These worlds are almost
invariably quarantined by other planets.

<a id="tag-forbidden-tech"></a>

## Forbidden Tech

Some group on this planet fabricates or uses maltech. Unbraked AIs
doomed to metastasize into insanity, nation-destroying nanowarfare
particles, slow-burn DNA corruptives, genetically engineered slaves,
or something worse still. The planet's larger population may or may
not be aware of the danger in their midst.

Government building meeting room


<a id="tag-flying-cities"></a>

## Flying Cities

Perhaps the world is a gas giant, or plagued with unendurable storms
at lower levels of the atmosphere. For whatever reason, the cities of
this world fly above the surface of the planet. Perhaps they remain
stationary, or perhaps they move from point to point in search of
resources.

Catwalks stretching over unimaginable gulfs below.


<a id="tag-former-warriors"></a>

## Former Warriors

The locals of this world were once famed for their martial
prowess. They may have simply had a very militaristic culture, or were
genetically engineered for combat, or developed high-tech weaponry, or
had brilliant leadership. Those days are past, however, either due to
crushing defeat, external restrictions, or a cultural turn toward
peace.


<a id="org70e2f9c"></a>

warfare seeking revenge


<a id="orgd1eae91"></a>

### Places

Cemetery of dead heroes, Memorial hall now left to dust and silence,
Monument plaza dedicated to the new culture


<a id="tag-freak-geology"></a>

## Freak Geology

The geology or geography of this world is simply freakish. Perhaps
it's composed entirely of enormous mountain ranges, or regular bands
of land and sea, or the mineral structures all fragment into perfect
cubes. The locals have learned to deal with it and their culture will
be shaped by its requirements.


<a id="orge787aa1"></a>

<a id="tag-friendly-foe"></a>

## Friendly Foe

Some hostile alien race or malevolent cabal has a branch or sect on
this world that is actually quite friendly toward outsiders. For
whatever internal reason, they are willing to negotiate and deal
honestly with strangers, and appear to lack the worst impulses of
their fellows.


<a id="org1095ec2"></a>

## Freak Weather

The planet is plagued with some sort of bizarre or hazardous weather
pattern. Perhaps city-flattening storms regularly scourge the surface,
or the world's sun never pierces its thick banks of clouds.


<a id="orge42aed6"></a>

### Enemies

Criminal using the weather as a cover, Weather cultists convinced the
offworlders are responsible for some disaster, Native predators
dependent on the weather

<a id="tag-gold-rush"></a>

## Gold Rush

Gold, silver, and other conventional precious minerals are common and
cheap now that asteroid mining is practical for most worlds. But some
minerals and compounds remain precious and rare, and this world has
recently been discovered to have a supply of them. People from across
the sector have come to strike it rich.


<a id="org2dd7e22"></a>

### Enemies

Paranoid prospector, Aspiring mining tycoon, Rapacious merchant

### Places

Secret mine, Native alien village, Processing plant, Boom town


<a id="tag-great-work"></a>

## Great Work

The locals are obsessed with completing a massive project, one that
has consumed them for generations. It might be the completion of a
functioning spaceyard, a massive solar power array, a network of
terraforming engines, or the universal conversion of their neighbors
to their own faith. The purpose of their entire civilization is to
progress and some day complete the work.


<a id="org8446f7a"></a>

### Enemies

Local planning to sacrifice the PCs for the work, Local who thinks the

### Places

A bustling work site, Ancestral worker housing, Local community made
only semi-livable by the demands of the work


<a id="tag-heavy-industry"></a>

## Heavy Industry

With interstellar transport so limited in the bulk it can move, worlds
have to be largely self-sufficient in industry. Some worlds are more
sufficient than others, however, and this planet has a thriving
manufacturing sector capable of producing large amounts of goods
appropriate to its tech level. The locals may enjoy a correspondingly
higher lifestyle, or the products might be devoted towards vast
projects for the aggrandizement of the rulers.


<a id="org84ac6b0"></a>

### Enemies

Tycoon monopolist, Industrial spy, Malcontent revolutionary


<a id="org046992f"></a>

<a id="org0e41bea"></a>

### Places

Factory floor, Union meeting hall, Toxic waste dump, R&D complex


<a id="tag-hatred"></a>

## Hatred

For whatever reason, this world's populace has a burning hatred for
the inhabitants of a neighboring system. Perhaps this world was
colonized by exiles, or there was a recent interstellar war, or ideas
of racial or religious superiority have fanned the hatred. Regardless
of the cause, the locals view their neighbor and any sympathizers with
loathing.


<a id="org502bb8d"></a>

### Enemies

spaceship kept as a trophy


<a id="tag-heavy-mining"></a>

## Heavy Mining

This world has large stocks of valuable minerals, usually necessary
for local industry, life support, or refinement into loads small
enough to export offworld. Major mining efforts are necessary to
extract the minerals, and many natives work in the industry.


<a id="org18f89bf"></a>

### Enemies

Mine boss, Tunnel saboteur, Subterranean predators


<a id="orgf87e4c2"></a>

### Friends

Hermit prospector, Offworld investor, Miner's union representative

### Places

Vertical mine face, Tailing piles, Roaring smelting complex


<a id="tag-hivemind"></a>

## Hivemind

Natives of this world exist in a kind of mental gestalt, sharing
thoughts and partaking of a single identity. Powerful pretech, exotic
psionics, alien influence, or some other cause has left the world
sharing one identity. Individual members may have greater or lesser
degrees of effective coordination with the whole.


<a id="org2bf6ab5"></a>

### Enemies

A hivemind that wants to assimilate outsiders, A hivemind that has no
respect for unjoined life, A hivemind that fears and hates unjoined
life

relative of someone who has been assimilated


<a id="orgb0ae38e"></a>

### Complications

The hivemind only functions on this world, The hivemind has strict
range limits, The hivemind has different personality factions, The
hivemind only happens at particular times, The world is made of
semi-sentient drones and a single AI


<a id="org1b60df7"></a>

### Things

Vital tech for maintaining the mind, Precious treasure held by
now-assimilated outsider, Tech that “blinds” the hivemind to the
tech's users


<a id="org281bc1f"></a>

### Places

Barely tolerable living cells for individuals, Workside where
individuals casually die in their labors, Community with absolutely no
social or group-gathering facilities


<a id="tag-hostile-biosphere"></a>

## Hostile Biosphere

The world is teeming with life, and it hates humans. Perhaps the life
is xenoallergenic, forcing filter masks and tailored antiallergens for
survival. It could be the native predators are huge and fearless, or
the toxic flora ruthlessly outcompetes earth crops.


<a id="org3875ce5"></a>

### Enemies

Local fauna, Nature cultist, Native aliens, Callous labor overseer


<a id="orge11227b"></a>

### Places

Deceptively peaceful glade, Steaming polychrome jungle, Nightfall when
surrounded by Things


<a id="tag-holy-war"></a>

## Holy War

A savage holy war is raging on this world, either between factions of
locals or as a united effort against the pagans of some neighboring
world. This war might involve a conventional religion, or it might be
the result of a branding campaign, political ideology, artistic
movement, or any other cause that people use as a substitute for
traditional religion.


<a id="org5a59d08"></a>

### Enemies

Blood-mad pontiff, Coldly cynical secular leader, Totalitarian
political demagogue


<a id="org8cc2346"></a>

### Friends

Desperate peacemaker, Hard-pressed refugee of the fighting, Peaceful
religious leader who lost the internal debate


<a id="org7abcf2f"></a>

### Complications

The targets of the war really are doing something diabolically
horrible, The holy war is just a mask for a very traditional casus
belli, The leaders don't want the war won but only prolonged, Both
this world and the target of the war are religion-obsessed


<a id="org8744798"></a>

### Things

Sacred relic of the faith, A captured blasphemer under a death
sentence, Plunder seized in battle

### Places

Massive holy structure, Razed community of infidels, Vast shrine to
the martyrs dead in war


<a id="tag-hostile-space"></a>

## Hostile Space

The system in which the world exists is a dangerous
neighborhood. Something about the system is perilous to inhabitants,
either through meteor swarms, stellar radiation, hostile aliens in the
asteroid belt, or periodic comet clouds.


<a id="org4be06f2"></a>

### Enemies

Alien raid leader, Meteor-launching terrorists, Paranoid local leader

### Places

City watching an approaching asteroid, Village burnt in an alien raid,
Massive ancient crater


<a id="tag-immortals"></a>

## Immortals

Natives of this world are effectively immortal. They may have been
gengineered for tremendous lifespans, or have found some local
anagathic, or be cyborg life forms, or be so totally convinced of
reincarnation that death is a cultural irrelevance. Any immortality
technique is likely applicable only to them, or else it's apt to be a
massive draw to outside imperialists.


<a id="orgb2249b3"></a>

### Enemies

Outsider determined to steal immortality, Smug local convinced of
their immortal wisdom to rule all, Offworlder seeking the world's ruin
before it becomes a threat to all


<a id="org0c8f1b0"></a>

### Friends

### Complications

Immortality requires doing something that outsiders can't or won't
willingly do, The immortality ends if they leave the world, Death is
the punishment for even minor crimes, Immortals must die or go
offworld after a certain span, Immortality has brutal side-effects


<a id="org44afc00"></a>

ancient age, Cultural performance relying on a century of in-jokes


<a id="tag-local-tech"></a>

## Local Tech

The locals can create a particular example of extremely high tech,
possibly even something that exceeds pretech standards. They may use
unique local resources to do so, or have stumbled on a narrow
scientific breakthrough, or still have a functional experimental
manufactory.


<a id="orgd017fd1"></a>

### Enemies

Keeper of the tech, Offworld industrialist, Automated defenses that
suddenly come alive, Native alien mentors


<a id="orgd786a7e"></a>

### Places

Alien factory, Lethal R&D center, Tech brokerage vault


<a id="tag-local-specialty"></a>

## Local Specialty

The world may be sophisticated or barely capable of steam engines, but
either way it produces something rare and precious to the wider
galaxy. It might be some pharmaceutical extract produced by a secret
recipe, a remarkably popular cultural product, or even gengineered
humans uniquely suited for certain work.


<a id="orgf124487"></a>

### Enemies

Monopolist, Offworlder seeking prohibition of the specialty, Native
who views the specialty as sacred


<a id="orgb082d3d"></a>

offworlders, The specialty is made in a remote, dangerous place, The
crafters don't want to make the specialty any more


<a id="org9ca6852"></a>

### Things

The specialty itself, The secret recipe, Sample of a new improved
variety


<a id="orgcabf81a"></a>

### Places

Secret manufactory, Hidden cache, Artistic competition for best
artisan


<a id="tag-major-spaceyard"></a>

## Major Spaceyard

Most worlds of tech level 4 or greater have the necessary tech and
orbital facilities to build spike drives and starships. This world is
blessed with a major spaceyard facility, either inherited from before
the Silence or painstakingly constructed in more recent decades. It
can build even capital-class hulls, and do so more quickly and cheaply
than its neighbors.


<a id="orgaf4843f"></a>

### Enemies

Enemy saboteur, Industrial spy, Scheming construction tycoon, Aspiring
ship hijacker


<a id="orgb3bb9c4"></a>

### Places

Hidden shipyard bay, Surface of a partially-completed ship, Ship scrap
graveyard


<a id="tag-mandarinate"></a>

## Mandarinate

The planet is ruled by an intellectual elite chosen via ostensibly
neutral examinations or tests. The values this system selects for may
or may not have anything to do with actual practical leadership
skills, and the examinations may be more or less corruptible.


<a id="org2e17499"></a>

### Enemies

Corrupt test administrator, Incompetent but highly-rated graduate,
Ruthless leader of a clan of high-testing relations


<a id="org6b9a133"></a>

### Friends

Crusader for test reform, Talented but poorly-connected graduate,
Genius who tests badly


<a id="orgeb9f69a"></a>

### Complications

The test is totally unrelated to necessary governing skills, The test
was very pertinent in the past but tech or culture has changed, The
test is for a skill that is vital to maintaining society but
irrelevant to day-to-day governance, The test is a sham and passage is
based on wealth or influence


<a id="org582a0c6"></a>

### Things

Answer key to the next test, Lost essay of incredible merit, Proof of
cheating


<a id="orgff59304"></a>

### Places

Massive structure full of test-taking cubicles, School filled with
desperate students, Ornate government building decorated with
scholarly quotes and academic images


<a id="tag-maneaters"></a>

## Maneaters

The locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or out of cultural
preference. Some worlds may actually eat human flesh, while others
simply require the rendering of humans into important chemicals or
pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps to prolong the lives of ghoul
overlords. This cannibalism plays a major role in their society.


<a id="orga9f3acb"></a>

### Enemies

Ruthless ghoul leader, Chieftain of a ravenous tribe, Sophisticated
degenerate preaching the splendid authenticity of cannibalism


<a id="orgbac2fd3"></a>

necessary, The locals farm human beings, Outsiders are expected to
join in the custom, The custom is totally unnecessary but jealously
maintained by the people

Belongings of a recent meal, An offworlder VIP due for the menu, A
toxin that makes human flesh lethal to consumers


<a id="orgceaedac"></a>

Hideous human abattoir, Extremely civilized restaurant,
Funeral-home-cum-kitchen


<a id="tag-mandate-base"></a>

## Mandate Base

The Terran Mandate retained its control over this world for much
longer than usual, and the world may still consider itself a true
inheritor of Mandate legitimacy. Most of these worlds have or had
superior technology, but they may still labor under the burden of
ancient restrictive tech or monitoring systems designed to prevent
them from rebelling.


<a id="orgfadf5c1"></a>

### Enemies

Deranged Mandate monitoring AI, Aspiring sector ruler, Demagogue
preaching local superiority over “traitorous rebel worlds”.


<a id="orge2771b0"></a>

use of their tech, The original colonists are all dead and have been
replaced by outsiders who don't understand all the details

Carefully-maintained monument to Mandate glory


<a id="tag-megacorps"></a>

## Megacorps

The world is dominated by classic cyberpunk-esque megacorporations,
each one far more important than the vestigial national remnants that
encompass them. These megacorps are usually locked in a cold war,
trading and dealing with each other even as they try to strike in
deniable ways. An over-council of corporations usually acts to bring
into line any that get excessively overt in their activities.


<a id="org4c44263"></a>

### Enemies

Megalomaniacal executive, Underling looking to use the PCs as
catspaws, Ruthless mercenary who wants what the PCs have

The megacorps are the only source of something vital to life on this
world, An autonomous Mandate system acts to punish excessively overt
violence, The megacorps are struggling against much more horrible
national governments

<a id="tag-misandry-misogyny"></a>

## Misandry/Misogyny

The culture on this world holds a particular gender in
contempt. Members of that gender are not permitted positions of formal
power, and may be restricted in their movements and activities. Some
worlds may go so far as to scorn both traditional genders, using
gengineering techniques to hybridize or alter conventional human
biology.


<a id="orgc8daa8e"></a>

Cultural fundamentalist, Cultural missionary to outworlders, Local
rebel driven to pointless and meaningless violence

### Complications

The oppressed gender is restive against the customs, The oppressed
gender largely supports the customs, The customs relate to some
physical quality of the world, The oppressed gender has had maltech
gengineering done to “tame” them.

<a id="tag-minimal-contact"></a>

## Minimal Contact

The locals refuse most contact with offworlders. Only a small,
quarantined treaty port is provided for offworld trade, and ships can
expect an exhaustive search for contraband. Local governments may be
trying to keep the very existence of interstellar trade a secret from
their populations, or they may simply consider offworlders too
dangerous or repugnant to be allowed among the population.

<a id="tag-night-world"></a>

## Night World

The world is plunged into eternal darkness. The only life on this
planet derives its energy from other sources, such as geothermal heat,
extremely volatile chemical reactions in the planet's soil, or light
in a non-visible spectrum. Most flora and fauna is voraciously eager
to consume other life.


<a id="org3d34499"></a>

### Enemies

### Things

Rare chemicals created in the darkness, Light source usable on this
world, Smuggler cache hidden here in ages past

### Places

Formlessly pitch-black wilderness, Sea without a sun, Location defined
by sounds or smells


<a id="tag-nomads"></a>

## Nomads

Most of the natives of this world are nomadic, usually following a
traditional cycle of movement through the lands they possess. Promises
of rich plunder or local environmental perils can force these groups
to strike out against neighbors. Other groups are forced to move
constantly due to unpredictable dangers that crop up on the planet.


<a id="org25c4ea7"></a>

### Enemies

Desperate tribal leader who needs what the PCs have, Ruthless raider
 chieftain, Leader seeking to weld the nomads into an army

<a id="tag-oceanic-world"></a>

## Oceanic World

The world is entirely or almost entirely covered with liquid
water. Habitations might be floating cities, or might cling
precariously to the few rocky atolls jutting up from the waves, or are
planted as bubbles on promontories deep beneath the stormy
surface. Survival depends on aquaculture. Planets with inedible alien
life rely on gengineered Terran sea crops.

<a id="tag-out-of-contact"></a>

## Out of Contact

The natives have been entirely out of contact with the greater galaxy
for centuries or longer. Perhaps the original colonists were seeking
to hide from the rest of the universe, or the Silence destroyed any
means of communication. It may have been so long that human origins on
other worlds have regressed into a topic for legends. The players
might be on the first offworld ship to land since the First Wave of
colonization a thousand years ago.


<a id="orgdd30650"></a>

<a id="tag-outpost-world"></a>

## Outpost World

The world is only a tiny outpost of human habitation planted by an
offworld corporation or government. Perhaps the staff is there to
serve as a refueling and repair stop for passing ships, or to oversee
an automated mining and refinery complex. They might be there to study
ancient ruins, or simply serve as a listening and monitoring post for
traffic through the system. The outpost is likely well-equipped with
defenses against casual piracy.


<a id="org37d7b64"></a>

### Enemies

Space-mad outpost staffer, Outpost commander who wants it to stay

<a id="tag-perimeter-agency"></a>

## Perimeter Agency

Before the Silence, the Perimeter was a Terran-sponsored organization
charged with rooting out use of maltech, technology banned in human
space as too dangerous for use or experimentation. Unbraked AIs,
gengineered slave species, nanotech replicators, weapons of planetary
destruction&#x2026; the Perimeter hunted down experimenters with a great
indifference to planetary laws. Most Perimeter Agencies collapsed
during the Silence, but a few managed to hold on to their mission,
though modern Perimeter agents often find more work as conventional
spies.


<a id="org1850395"></a>

### Enemies

Renegade Agency Director, Maltech researcher, Paranoid intelligence
chief


<a id="org076fbb0"></a>

### Friends

<a id="tag-pilgrimage-site"></a>

## Pilgrimage Site

The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location,
and might be the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or
political movement. The site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout
nearby space, and those with the money necessary to manage
interstellar travel can be quite generous to the site and its
keepers. The locals tend to be fiercely protective of the place and
its reputation, and some places may forbid the entrance of those not
suitably pious or devout.


<a id="org404fccc"></a>

### Enemies

Saboteur devoted to a rival belief, Bitter reformer who resents the
current leadership, Swindler conning the pilgrims


<a id="org6d71f35"></a>

### Friends

Protector of the holy site, Naive offworlder pilgrim, Outsider wanting

Ancient relic guarded at the site, Proof of the site's inauthenticity,
Precious offering from a pilgrim

### Places

Incense-scented sanctum, Teeming crowd of pilgrims, Imposing holy

<a id="tag-pleasure-world"></a>

## Pleasure World

This world provides delights either rare or impermissible
elsewhere. Matchless local beauty, stunningly gengineered natives, a
wide variety of local drugs, carnal pleasures unacceptable on other
worlds, or some other rare delight is readily available here. Most
worlds are fully aware of the value of their offerings, and the prices
they demand can be in credits or in less tangible recompense.


<a id="org7e4e5d6"></a>

### Enemies

Purveyor of evil delights, Local seeking to control others with
addictions, Offworlder exploiter of native resources


<a id="org01231c3"></a>

### Friends

Tourist who's in too deep, Native seeking a more meaningful life
elsewhere, Offworld entertainer looking for training here


<a id="org503a665"></a>

### Complications

A deeply repugnant pleasure is offered here by a culture that sees
nothing wrong with it, Certain pleasures here are dangerously
addictive, The prices here can involve enslavement or death, The world
has been seized and exploited by an imperial power


<a id="org93d865c"></a>

### Things

Forbidden drug, A contract for some unspeakable payment, Powerful tech
repurposed for hedonistic ends

### Places

Breathtaking natural feature, Artful but decadent salon, Grimy den of
desperate vice


<a id="tag-post-scarcity"></a>

## Post-Scarcity

The locals have maintained sufficient Mandate-era tech to be
effectively post-scarcity in their economic structure. Everyone has
all the necessities and most of the desires they can imagine. Conflict
now exists over the apportionment of services and terrestrial space,
since anything else can be had in abundance. Military goods and items
of mass destruction may still be restricted, and there is probably
some reason that the locals do not export their vast wealth.


<a id="orgecb0b1a"></a>

### Enemies

Frenzied ideologue fighting over an idea, Paranoid local fearing
offworlder influence, Grim reformer seeking the destruction of the
“enfeebling” productive tech


<a id="orgd86db01"></a>

### Friends

Offworlder seeking something available only here, Local struggling to
maintain the production tech, Native missionary seeking to bring
abundance to other worlds


<a id="orge4af99a"></a>

### Complications

The tech causes serious side-effects on those who take advantage of
it, The tech is breaking down, The population is growing too large,
The tech produces only certain things in abundance


<a id="org0041bf6"></a>

### Things

A cornucopia device, A rare commodity that cannot be duplicated,
Contract for services

### Places

Tiny but richly-appointed private quarters, Mar ket for services,
Hushed non-duped art salon


<a id="tag-police-state"></a>

## Police State

The world is a totalitarian police state. Any sign of disloyalty to
the planet's rulers is punished severely, and suspicion riddles
society. Some worlds might operate by Soviet-style informers and
indoctrination, while more technically sophisticated worlds might rely
on omnipresent cameras or braked AI “guardian angels”. Outworlders are
apt to be treated as a necessary evil at best, and “disappeared” if
they become troublesome.


<a id="org33ef66e"></a>

### Enemies

Secret police chief, Scapegoating official, Treacherous native
informer


<a id="org41f57c1"></a>

### Friends

Rebel leader, Offworld agitator, Imprisoned victim, Crime boss


<a id="orgc581611"></a>

### Complications

The natives largely believe in the righteousness of the state, The
police state is automated and its “rulers” can't shut it off, The
leaders foment a pogrom against “offworlder spies”.


<a id="org85ed602"></a>

### Things

List of police informers, Wealth taken from “enemies of the state”,

<a id="tag-preceptor-archive"></a>

## Preceptor Archive

The Preceptors of the Great Archive were a pre-Silence organization
devoted to ensuring the dissemination of human culture, history, and
basic technology to frontier worlds that risked losing this
information during the human expansion. Most frontier planets had an
Archive where natives could learn useful technical skills in addition
to human history and art. Those Archives that managed to survive the
Silence now strive to send their missionaries of knowledge to new
worlds in need of their lore.


<a id="orgaffa794"></a>

### Enemies

toward their teaching, The Archive has maintained some replicable
pretech science, The Archive has been corrupted and their teaching is
incorrect


<a id="orga85577c"></a>

### Things

Lost Archive database, Ancient pretech teaching equipment, Hidden
cache of unacceptable tech


<a id="org4cb1984"></a>

### Places

Archive lecture hall, Experimental labora tory, Student-local riot


<a id="tag-pretech-cultists"></a>

## Pretech Cultists

The capacities of human science before the Silence vastly outmatch the
technology available since the Scream. The Jump Gates alone were
capable of crossing hundreds of light years in a moment, and they were
just one example of the results won by blending psychic artifice with
pretech science. Some worlds outright worship the artifacts of their
ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect
humanity. These cultists may or may not understand the operation or
replication of these devices, but they seek and guard them jealously.


<a id="org21d79b1"></a>

### Enemies

Cult leader, Artifact supplier, Pretech smuggler


<a id="org2822308"></a>

### Friends

Offworld scientist, Robbed collector, Cult heretic

### Things

Pretech artifacts both functional and broken, Religious-jargon laced
pretech replication techniques, Waylaid payment for pretech artifacts

### Places

Shrine to nonfunctional pretech, Smuggler's den, Public procession
showing a prized artifact


<a id="tag-prison-planet"></a>

## Prison Planet

This planet is or was intended as a prison. Some such prisons were
meant for specific malefactors of the Terran Mandate, while others
were to contain entire “dangerous” ethnic groups or alien races. Some
may still have warden AIs or automatic systems to prevent any
unauthorized person from leaving, and any authorization permits have
long since expired.


<a id="orgdc21aca"></a>

### Enemies

Crazed warden AI, Brutal heir to gang leadership, Offworlder who's
somehow acquired warden powers and exploits the locals

facility manned by mandatory numbers of prisoners, Make shift shop
where contraband is assembled


<a id="tag-primitive-aliens"></a>

## Primitive Aliens

The world is populated by a large number of sapient aliens that have
yet to develop advanced technology. The human colonists may have a
friendly or hostile relationship with the aliens, but a certain
intrinsic tension is likely. Small human colonies might have been
enslaved or otherwise subjugated.

<a id="tag-psionics-academy"></a>

## Psionics Academy

This world is one of the few that have managed to redevelop the basics
of psychic training. Without this education, a potential psychic is
doomed to either madness or death unless they refrain from using their
abilities. Psionic academies are rare enough that offworlders are
often sent there to study by wealthy patrons. The secrets of psychic
mentorship, the protocols and techniques that allow a psychic to
successfully train another, are carefully guarded at these
academies. Most are closely affiliated with the planetary government.


<a id="org4850618"></a>

The academy curriculum kills a significant percentage of students, The
faculty use students as research subjects, The students are

### Places

<a id="tag-psionics-fear"></a>

## Psionics Fear

The locals are terrified of psychics. Perhaps their history is studded
with feral psychics who went on murderous rampages, or perhaps they
simply nurse an unreasoning terror of those “mutant freaks”. Psychics
demonstrate their powers at risk of their lives.


<a id="org8d9575b"></a>

### Enemies

### Things

Hidden psitech cache, Possessions of convicted psychics, Reward for
turning in a psychic


<a id="org835d4fb"></a>

### Places

Inquisitorial chamber, Lynching site, Museum of psychic atrocities


<a id="tag-psionics-worship"></a>

## Psionics Worship

These natives view psionic powers as a visible gift of god or sign of
superiority. If the world has a functional psychic training academy,
psychics occupy almost all major positions of power and are considered
the natural and proper rulers of the world. If the world lacks
training facilities, it is likely a hodgepodge of demented cults, with
each one dedicated to a marginally-coherent feral prophet and their
psychopathic ravings.


<a id="org03835aa"></a>

### Enemies

### Complications

The psychic training is imperfect, and the psychics all show
significant mental illness, The psychics have developed a unique
discipline, The will of a psychic is law, Psychics in the party are
forcibly kidnapped for “enlightening”.


<a id="org0f79792"></a>

### Things

Ancient psitech, Valuable psychic research records, Permission for

<a id="tag-quarantined-world"></a>

## Quarantined World

The world is under a quarantine, and space travel to and from it is
strictly forbidden. This may be enforced by massive ground batteries
that burn any interlopers from the planet's sky, or it may be that a
neighboring world runs a persistent blockade.


<a id="org23d8df2"></a>

<a id="tag-radioactive-world"></a>

## Radioactive World

Whether due to a legacy of atomic warfare unhindered by nuke snuffers
or a simple profusion of radioactive elements, this world glows in the
dark. Even heavy vacc suits can filter only so much of the radiation,
and most natives suffer a wide variety of cancers, mutations and other
illnesses without the protection of advanced medical treatments.

<a id="tag-refugees"></a>

## Refugees

The world teems with refugees, either exiles from another planet who
managed to get here, or the human detritus of some local conflict that
have fled to the remaining stable states. The natives usually regard
the refugees with hostility, an attitude returned by many among their
unwilling guests.


<a id="org998fe2c"></a>

### Enemies

refugees are right that the xenophobes want them out or dead, Both are
right, Outside powers are using the refugees to destabilize an enemy
government, Refugee and local cultures are extremely incompatible

<a id="tag-restrictive-laws"></a>

## Restrictive Laws

A myriad of laws, customs, and rules constrain the inhabitants of this
world, and even acts that are completely permissible elsewhere are
punished severely here. The locals may provide lists of these laws to
offworlders, but few non-natives can hope to master all the important
intricacies.

<a id="tag-regional-hegemon"></a>

## Regional Hegemon

This world has the technological sophistication, natural resources,
and determined polity necessary to be a regional hegemon for the
sector. Nearby worlds are likely either directly subservient to it or
tack carefully to avoid its anger. It may even be the capital of a
small stellar empire.

### Enemies

Ambitious general, Colonial official, Contemptuous noble


<a id="org574aff9"></a>

### Friends

## Revanchists

The locals formerly owned another world, or a major nation on the
planet formerly owned an additional region of land. Something happened
to take away this control or drive out the former rulers, and they've
never forgotten it. The locals are obsessed with reclaiming their lost
lands, and will allow no questions of practicality to interfere with
their cause.


<a id="org1c2f50f"></a>

### Enemies

### Friends

Realist local clergy seeking peace, Politician trying to calm the
public, Third-party diplomat trying to stamp out the fire


<a id="org65343e0"></a>

### Complications

The revanchists' claim is completely just and reasonable, The land is
now occupied entirely by heirs of the conquerors, Both sides have
seized lands the other thinks are theirs


<a id="orgbcd1281"></a>

### Things

Stock of vital resource produced by the taken land, Relic carried out
of it, Proof that the land claim is justified or unjustified


<a id="org930abd9"></a>

### Places

Memorial monument to the loss, Cemetery of those who died in the
conquest, Public ceremony commemorating the disaster


<a id="tag-revolutionaries"></a>

## Revolutionaries

The world is convulsed by one or more bands of revolutionaries, with
some nations perhaps in the grip of a current revolution. Most of
these upheavals can be expected only to change the general flavor of
problems in the polity, but the process of getting there usually
produces a tremendous amount of suffering.


<a id="org7feb07c"></a>

### Enemies

Blood-drenched revolutionary leader, Blood-drenched secret police
chief, Hostile foreign agent seeking further turmoil


<a id="org1bbb2e0"></a>

### Friends

Sympathetic victim accused of revolutionary sympathies or government
collaboration, Revolutionary or state agent who now repents, Agent of
a neutral power that wants peace


<a id="org909bb57"></a>

### Complications

The revolutionaries actually do seem likely to put in better rulers,
The revolutionaries are client groups that got out of hand, The
revolutionaries are clearly much worse than the government, The
revolutionaries have no real ideals beyond power and merely pretend to
ideology


<a id="org54ba792"></a>

### Things

List of secret revolutionary sympathizers, Proof of rebel hypocrisy,
Confiscated wealth


<a id="org2b70498"></a>

### Places

Festival that explodes into violence, Heavily-fortified police
station, Revolutionary base hidden in the wilderness


<a id="tag-rising-hegemon"></a>

## Rising Hegemon

This world is not yet a dominant power in the sector, but it's well on
its way there. Whether through newly-blossoming economic, military, or
cultural power, they're extending their influence over their neighbors
and forging new arrangements between their government and the rulers
of nearby worlds.


<a id="org566b0b4"></a>

### Enemies

Jingoistic supremacist, Official bent on glorious success, Foreign
agent saboteur


<a id="org107753a"></a>

### Friends

Friendly emissary to the benighted, Hardscrabble local turned great
success, Foreign visitor seeking contacts or knowledge


<a id="org494344d"></a>

### Complications

They're only strong because their neighbors have been weakened, Their
success is based on a fluke resource or pretech find, They bitterly
resent their neighbors as former oppressors


<a id="org2f04dd5"></a>

### Things

Tribute shipment, Factory or barracks emblematic of their power
source, Tech or data that will deal a blow to their rise


<a id="org9a5d5e1"></a>

### Places

Rustic town being hurled into prosperity, Government building being
expanded, Starport struggling under the flow of new ships


<a id="tag-rigid-culture"></a>

## Rigid Culture

The local culture is extremely rigid. Certain forms of behavior and
belief are absolutely mandated, and any deviation from these
principles is punished, or else society may be strongly stratified by
birth with limited prospects for change. Anything which threatens the
existing social order is feared and shunned.


<a id="org98dc137"></a>

### Enemies

Rigid reactionary, Wary ruler, Regime ideologue, Offended potentate


<a id="org1d36101"></a>

### Friends

Revolutionary agitator, Ambitious peasant, Frustrated merchant


<a id="orgd68af8d"></a>

### Complications

The cultural patterns are enforced by technological aids, The culture
is run by a secret cabal of manipulators, The culture has explicit
religious sanction, The culture evolved due to important necessities
that have since been forgotten


<a id="org62fab18"></a>

### Things

Precious traditional regalia, Peasant tribute, Opulent treasures of
the ruling class


<a id="org66e67f5"></a>

### Places

Time-worn palace, Low-caste slums, Bandit den, Reformist temple


<a id="tag-ritual-combat"></a>

## Ritual Combat

The locals favor some form of stylized combat to resolve disputes,
provide entertainment, or settle religious differences. This combat is
probably not normally lethal unless it's reserved for a specific
disposable class of slaves or professionals. Some combat may involve
mastery of esoteric weapons and complex arenas, while other forms
might require nothing more than a declaration in the street and a
drawn gun.


<a id="org7c10411"></a>

### Enemies

Bloodthirsty local champion, Ambitious gladiator stable owner,
Xenophobic master fighter


<a id="org3360a42"></a>

### Friends

Peace-minded foreign missionary, Temperate defender of the weak, Local
eager to learn of offworld fighting styles


<a id="org97eea93"></a>

### Complications

The required weapons are strange pretech artifacts, Certain classes
are forbidden from fighting and require champions, Loss doesn't mean
death but it does mean ritual scarring or property loss


<a id="orgc097c71"></a>

### Things

Magnificent weapon, Secret book of martial techniques, Token
signifying immunity to ritual combat challenges, Prize won in bloody
battle


<a id="orge38ec59"></a>

### Places

Area full of cheering spectators, Dusty street outside a saloon,
Memorial for fallen warriors


<a id="tag-robots"></a>

## Robots

The world has a great many robots on it. Most bots are going to be
non-sentient expert systems, though an AI with enough computing
resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have
developed VIs to a degree that individual bots can seem (or be)
sentient. Some worlds might even be ruled by metal overlords, ones
which do not need to be sentient so long as they have overwhelming
force.


<a id="orgac9ffb7"></a>

### Enemies

Hostile robot master, Robot greedy to seize offworld tech, Robot
fallen in love with the PC's ship, Oligarch whose factories build
robots


<a id="org4392674"></a>

### Friends

Data-seeking robot, Plucky young robot tech, Local being pushed out of
a job by robots


<a id="orgdeb0772"></a>

### Complications

The robots are only partially controlled, The robots are salvaged and
originally meant for a much darker use, The robots require a rare
material that the locals fight over, The robots require the planet's
specific infrastructure so cannot be exported


<a id="orga6d6612"></a>

### Things

Prototype robot, Secret robot override codes, Vast cache of robot-made
goods, Robot-destroying pretech weapon


<a id="org05542e6"></a>

### Places

Humming robotic factory, Stark robotic “barracks”, House crowded with
robot servants and only one human owner


<a id="tag-seagoing-cities"></a>

## Seagoing Cities

Either the world is entirely water or else the land is simply too
dangerous for most humans. Human settlement on this world consists of
a number of floating cities that follow the currents and the
fish. These cityships might have been purpose-built for their task, or
they could be jury-rigged conglomerations of ships and structures
thrown together when the need for seagoing life become apparent to the
locals.


<a id="org03ffe4d"></a>

### Enemies

Pirate city lord, Mer-human raider chieftain, Hostile landsman noble,
Enemy city saboteur


<a id="org23cf2a5"></a>

### Friends

faces starvation, Terrible storms drive the city into the glacial
regions, Suicide ships ram the city's hull


<a id="orgbc635f0"></a>

### Things

Giant pearls with mysterious chemical properties, Buried treasure,
Vital repair materials

### Places

Bridge of the city, Storm-tossed sea, A bridge fashioned of many small
boats.


<a id="tag-sealed-menace"></a>

## Sealed Menace

Something on this planet has the potential to create enormous havoc
for the inhabitants if it is not kept safely contained by its
keepers. Whether a massive seismic fault line suppressed by pretech
terraforming technology, a disease that has to be quarantined within
hours of discovery, or an ancient alien relic that requires regular
upkeep in order to prevent planetary catastrophe, the menace is a
constant shadow on the fearful populace.


<a id="org809a958"></a>

### Enemies

Hostile outsider bent on freeing the menace, Misguided fool who thinks
he can use it, Reckless researcher who thinks he can fix it


<a id="org6487d5d"></a>

### Friends

Keeper of the menace, Student of its nature, Victim of the menace


<a id="orgb37d13b"></a>

secret of the menace's true nature


<a id="org34c6c08"></a>

### Places

Guarded fortress containing the menace, Monitoring station, Scene of a
prior outbreak of the menace


<a id="tag-secret-masters"></a>

## Secret Masters

The world is actually run by a hidden cabal, acting through their
catspaws in the visible government. For one reason or another, this
group finds it imperative that they not be identified by outsiders,
and in some cases even the planet's own government may not realize
that they're actually being manipulated by hidden masters.


<a id="orgd02e5ab"></a>

### Enemies

An agent of the cabal, Government official who wants no questions
asked, Willfully blinded local


<a id="org418f6ac"></a>

### Friends

Paranoid conspiracy theorist, Machiavellian gamesman within the cabal,
Interstellar investigator


<a id="org3f7d4c4"></a>

### Complications

The secret masters have a benign reason for wanting secrecy, The cabal
fights openly amongst itself, The cabal is recruiting new members


<a id="org4e48daf"></a>

### Things

A dossier of secrets on a government official, A briefcase of unmarked
credit notes, The identity of a cabal member


<a id="org6fd84bb"></a>

### Places

Smoke-filled room, Shadowy alleyway, Secret underground bunker


<a id="tag-sectarians"></a>

## Sectarians

The world is torn by violent disagreement between sectarians of a
particular faith. Each views the other as a damnable heresy in need of
extirpation. Local government may be able to keep open war from
breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities. The nature
of the faith may be religious, or it may be based on some secular
ideology.


<a id="org53df93e"></a>

### Enemies

Paranoid believer, Native convinced the party is working for the other
side, Absolutist ruler


<a id="org52bae7f"></a>

### Friends

Reformist clergy, Local peacekeeping official, Offworld missionary,
Exhausted ruler


<a id="orgd56b42d"></a>

### Complications

The conflict has more than two sides, The sectarians hate each other
for multiple reasons, The sectarians must cooperate or else life on
this world is imperiled, The sectarians hate outsiders more than they
hate each other, The differences in sects are incomprehensible to an
outsider


<a id="orgc167ff2"></a>

### Things

Ancient holy book, Incontrovertible proof, Offering to a local holy
man


<a id="orgb1c8243"></a>

### Places

Sectarian battlefield, Crusading temple, Philosopher's salon, Bitterly
divided village


<a id="tag-seismic-instability"></a>

## Seismic Instability

The local land masses are remarkably unstable, and regular earthquakes
rack the surface. Local construction is either advanced enough to sway
and move with the vibrations or primitive enough that it is easily
rebuilt. Severe volcanic activity may be part of the instability.


<a id="org7780139"></a>

### Enemies

Earthquake cultist, Hermit seismologist, Burrowing native life form,
Earthquake-inducing saboteur


<a id="org970f56c"></a>

### Friends

Experimental construction firm owner, Adventurous volcanologist,
Geothermal prospector


<a id="org7a094ff"></a>

### Complications

The earthquakes are caused by malfunctioning pretech terraformers,
They're caused by alien technology, They're restrained by alien
technology that is being plundered by offworlders, The earthquakes are
used to generate enormous amounts of energy.


<a id="org0f0abe6"></a>

### Things

Earthquake generator, Earthquake suppressor, Mineral formed at the
core of the world, Earthquake-proof building schematics


<a id="orgac5e70b"></a>

### Places

Volcanic caldera, Village during an earthquake, Mud slide, Earthquake
opening superheated steam fissures


<a id="tag-shackled-world"></a>

## Shackled World

This world is being systematically contained by an outside power. Some
ancient autonomous defense grid, robot law enforcement, alien
artifact, or other force is preventing the locals from developing
certain technology, or using certain devices, or perhaps from
developing interstellar flight. This limit may or may not apply to
off-worlders; in the former case, the PCs may have to figure out a way
to beat the shackles simply to escape the world.


<a id="orgc2cb49c"></a>

### Enemies

Passionless jailer-AI, Paranoid military grid AI, Robot overlord,
Enigmatic alien master


<a id="org788a6d9"></a>

### Friends

Struggling local researcher, Offworlder trapped here, Scientist with a
plan to break the chains


<a id="orge90cb8f"></a>

### Complications

The shackles come off for certain brief windows of time, The locals
think the shackles are imposed by God, An outside power greatly
profits from the shackles, The rulers are exempt from the shackles


<a id="org848b033"></a>

### Things

Keycode to bypass the shackle, Tech shielded from the shackle,
Exportable version of the shackle that can affect other worlds


<a id="org9c0f5e8"></a>

### Places

Grim high-tech control center, Factory full of workaround tech, Temple
to the power or entity that imposed the shackle


<a id="tag-sole-supplier"></a>

## Sole Supplier

Some extremely important resource is exported from this world and this
world alone. It's unlikely that the substance is critical for building
spike drives unless this world is also the first to begin interstellar
flight, but it may be critical to other high-tech processes or
devices. The locals make a large amount of money off this trade and
control of it is of critical importance to the planet's rulers, and
potentially to outside powers.


<a id="orgc3340c6"></a>

### Enemies

Resource oligarch, Ruthless smuggler, Resource-controlling warlord,
Foreign agent seeking to subvert local government


<a id="orgab1aa51"></a>

### Friends

Doughty resource miner, Researcher trying to synthesize the stuff,
Small-scale resource producer, Harried starport trade overseer


<a id="org963f06c"></a>

### Complications

The substance is slow poison to process, The substance is created by
hostile alien natives, The substance is very easy to smuggle in usable
amounts, Only the natives have the genes or tech to extract it
effectively


<a id="org2633d29"></a>

### Things

Cache of processed resource, Trade permit to buy a load of it, A
shipment of nigh-un-detectably fake substance


<a id="org4f3b8be"></a>

### Places

Bustling resource extraction site, Opulent palace built with resource
money, Lazy town square where everyone lives on resource payments


<a id="tag-societal-despair"></a>

## Societal Despair

The world's dominant society has lost faith in itself. Whether through
some all-consuming war, great catastrophe, overwhelming outside
culture, or religious collapse, the natives no longer believe in their
old values, and search desperately for something new. Fierce conflict
often exists between the last believers in the old dispensation and
the nihilistic or searching disciples of the new age.


<a id="orgd91c4be"></a>

### Enemies

Zealot who blames outsiders for the decay, Nihilistic warlord,
Offworlder looking to exploit the local despair


<a id="org20f6912"></a>

### Friends

Struggling messenger of a new way, Valiant paragon of a fading
tradition, Local going through the motions of serving a now-irrelevant
role


<a id="orga56c220"></a>

### Complications

A massive war discredited all the old values, Outside powers are
working to erode societal confidence for their own benefit, A local
power is profiting greatly from the despair, The old ways were meant
to aid survival on this world and their passing is causing many new
woes


<a id="org50e7392"></a>

### Things

Relic that would inspire a renaissance, Art that would inspire new
ideas, Priceless artifact of a now-scorned belief


<a id="org4c7a96f"></a>

### Places

Empty temple, Crowded den of obliviating vice, Smoky hall full of
frantic speakers


<a id="tag-taboo-treasure"></a>

## Taboo Treasure

The natives here produce something that is both fabulously valuable
and strictly forbidden elsewhere in the sector. It may be a lethally
addictive drug, forbidden gengineering tech, vatgrown “perfect
slaves”, or a useful substance that can only be made through
excruciating human suffering. This treasure is freely traded on the
world, but bringing it elsewhere is usually an invitation to a long
prison stay or worse.


<a id="orgcc7225d"></a>

### Enemies

Maker of a vile commodity, Smuggler for a powerful offworlder,
Depraved offworlder here for “fun”, Local warlord who controls the
treasure


<a id="orga02995a"></a>

### Friends

Reformer seeking to end its use, Innovator trying to repurpose the
treasure in innocent ways, Wretched addict unwillingly prey to the
treasure


<a id="orgd8c0b78"></a>

### Complications

The treasure is extremely hard to smuggle, Its use visibly marks a
user, The natives consider it for their personal use only,


<a id="org426756e"></a>

### Things

Load of the forbidden good, Smuggling tech that could hide the good
perfectly, Blackmail data on offworld buyers of the good


<a id="org43b8f0c"></a>

### Places

Den where the good is used, Market selling the good to locals and a
few outsiders, Factory or processing area where the good is created


<a id="tag-terraform-failure"></a>

## Terraform Failure

This world was marginal for human habitation when it was discovered,
but the Mandate or the early government put in pretech terraforming
engines to correct its more extreme qualities. The terraforming did
not entirely work, either failing of its own or suffering the
destruction of the engines during the Silence. The natives are only
partly adapted to the world's current state, and struggle with the
environment.


<a id="org44ca5c6"></a>

### Enemies

Brutal ruler who cares only for their people, Offworlder trying to
loot the damaged engines, Warlord trying to seize limited habitable
land


<a id="org7feffad"></a>

### Friends

Local trying to fix the engines, Offworlder student of the engines,
World-wise native survivor


<a id="org5f3dc08"></a>

### Complications

The engines produced too much of something instead of too little, The
engines were hijacked by aliens with different preferences, It was
discovered that an Earth-like environment would eventually cause a
catastrophic disaster


<a id="org6bab96c"></a>

### Things

Parts to repair or restore the engines, Lootable pretech fragments,
Valuable local tech devised to cope with the world


<a id="org73d8042"></a>

### Places

Zone of tolerable gravity or temperature, Native settlement built to
cope with the environment, Massive ruined terraforming engine


<a id="tag-tomb-world"></a>

## Tomb World

Tomb worlds are planets that were once inhabited by humans before the
Silence. The sudden collapse of the jump gate network and the
inability to bring in the massive food supplies required by the planet
resulted in starvation, warfare, and death. Most tomb worlds are
naturally hostile to human habitation and could not raise sufficient
crops to maintain life. The few hydroponic facilities were usually
destroyed in the fighting, and all that is left now are ruins, bones,
and silence.


<a id="org9beeb93"></a>

### Enemies

Demented survivor tribe chieftain, Avaricious scavenger, Automated
defense system, Native predator


<a id="orgb94317e"></a>

### Friends

Scavenger Fleet captain, Archaeologist, Salvaging historian,
Xenophilic native survivor


<a id="org4f6866b"></a>

### Complications

The ruins are full of booby-traps left by the final inhabitants, The
world's atmosphere quickly degrades anything in an opened building, A
handful of desperate natives survived the Silence, The structures are
unstable and collapsing


<a id="org807159b"></a>

### Things

Lost pretech equipment, Tech caches, Stores of unused munitions,
Ancient historical data


<a id="org28b3b29"></a>

### Places

Crumbling hive-city, City square carpeted in bones, Ruined hydroponic
facility, Cannibal tribe's lair, Dead orbital jump gate


<a id="tag-theocracy"></a>

## Theocracy

The planet is ruled by the priesthood of the predominant religion or
ideology. The rest of the locals may or may not be terribly pious, but
the clergy have the necessary military strength, popular support or
control of resources to maintain their rule. Alternative faiths or
incompatible ideologies are likely to be both illegal and socially
unacceptable.


<a id="org19e2a1d"></a>

### Enemies

Decadent priest-ruler, Zealous inquisitor, Relentless proselytizer,
True Believer


<a id="org1daf8b4"></a>

### Friends

Heretic, Offworld theologian, Atheistic merchant, Desperate commoner


<a id="org29a78cb"></a>

### Complications

The theocracy actually works well, The theocracy is decadent and hated
by the common folk, The theocracy is divided into mutually hostile
sects, The theocracy is led by aliens


<a id="orgb23e03c"></a>

### Things

Precious holy text, Martyr's bones, Secret church records, Ancient
church treasures


<a id="org2bd607c"></a>

### Places

Glorious temple, Austere monastery, Academy for ideological
indoctrination, Decadent pleasure-cathedral


<a id="tag-trade-hub"></a>

## Trade Hub

This world is a major crossroads for local interstellar trade. It is
well-positioned at the nexus of several short-drill trade routes, and
has facilities for easy transfer of valuable cargoes and the fueling
and repairing of starships. The natives are accustomed to outsiders,
and a polyglot mass of people from every nearby world can be found
trading here.


<a id="org680f877"></a>

### Enemies

Cheating merchant, Thieving dockworker, Commercial spy, Corrupt
customs official


<a id="org2daec9b"></a>

### Friends

### Things

Voucher for a warehouse's contents, Insider trading information, Case
of precious off-world pharmaceuticals, Box of legitimate tax stamps indicating customs
dues have been paid.


<a id="orga568372"></a>

### Places

Raucous bazaar, Elegant restaurant, Spaceport teeming with activity,
Foggy street lined with warehouses


<a id="tag-tyranny"></a>

## Tyranny

The local government is brutal and indifferent to the will of the
people. Laws may or may not exist, but the only one that matters is
the whim of the rulers on any given day. Their minions swagger through
the streets while the common folk live in terror of their
appetites. The only people who stay wealthy are friends and servants
of the ruling class.


<a id="orgfe63f0b"></a>

### Enemies

Debauched autocrat, Sneering bully-boy, Soulless government official,
Occupying army officer


<a id="orgcefa1b2"></a>

### Friends

Conspiring rebel, Oppressed merchant, Desperate peasant, Inspiring
religious leader


<a id="org2ef68d9"></a>

### Complications

The tyrant rules with vastly superior technology, The tyrant is a
figurehead for a cabal of powerful men and women, The people are
resigned to their suffering, The tyrant is hostile to “meddlesome
outworlders”.


<a id="orgf8cac21"></a>

### Things

Plundered wealth, Beautiful toys of the elite, Regalia of rulership


<a id="org6e202ec"></a>

### Places

Impoverished village, Protest rally massacre, Decadent palace,
Religious hospital for the indigent


<a id="tag-urbanized-surface"></a>

## Urbanized Surface

The world's land area is covered with buildings that extend downward
for multiple levels. Such worlds either have a population in the
trillions, extremely little land area, or are largely-abandoned due to
some past catastrophe. Agriculture and resource extraction are part of
the urban complex, and there may be an advanced maintenance system
that may not be entirely under the control of present natives.


<a id="org0907c7d"></a>

### Enemies

Maintenance AI that hates outsiders, Tyrant of a habitation block,
Deep-dwelling prophet who considers “the sky” a blasphemy to be
quelled

### Friends

Local yearning for wild spaces, Grubby urchin of the underlevels,
Harried engineer trying to maintain ancient works, Grizzled hab cop


<a id="org81822b7"></a>

### Complications

The urban blocks are needed to survive the environment, The blocks
were part of an ancient device of world-spanning size, The blocks
require constant maintenance to avoid dangerous types of decay


<a id="orge82cd23"></a>

### Things

Massively efficient power source, Map of the secret ways of a zone,
Passkey into restricted hab block areas


<a id="orgcafc46d"></a>

### Places

Giant hab block now devoid of inhabitants, Chemical-reeking underway,
Seawater mine full of salt and massive flowing channels


<a id="tag-unbraked-ai"></a>

## Unbraked AI

Artificial intelligences are costly and difficult to create, requiring
a careful sequence of “growth stages” in order to bring them to
sentience before artificial limits on cognition speed and learning
development are installed. These “brakes” prevent runaway cognition
metastasis. This world has an “unbraked AI” on it, probably with a
witting or unwitting corps of servants. Unbraked AIs are quite insane,
but they learn and reason with a speed impossible for humans, and can
demonstrate a truly distressing subtlety.


<a id="orga31e1e4"></a>

### Enemies

AI Cultist, Maltech researcher, Government official dependent on the
AI


<a id="org08739ec"></a>

### Friends

Perimeter agent, AI researcher, Braked AI


<a id="org443fef6"></a>

### Complications

The AI's presence is unknown to the locals, The locals depend on the
AI for some vital service, The AI appears to be harmless, The AI has
fixated on the group's ship's computer, The AI wants transport
offworld


<a id="org86a8e7f"></a>

### Things

The room-sized AI core itself, Maltech research files, Perfectly
tabulated blackmail on government officials, Pretech computer
circuitry


<a id="orgc104802"></a>

### Places

Municipal computing banks, Cult compound, Repair center, Ancient
hardcopy library


<a id="tag-utopia"></a>

## Utopia

Natural and social conditions on this world have made it a paradise
for its inhabitants, a genuine utopia of happiness and
fulfillment. This is normally the result of drastic human engineering,
including brain-gelding, neurochemical control, personality curbs, or
complete “humanity” redefinitions. Even so, the natives are extremely
happy with their lot, and may wish to extend that joy to poor, sad
outsiders.


<a id="orgad9ab99"></a>

### Enemies

Compassionate neurotherapist, Proselytizing native missionary to
outsiders, Brutal tyrant who rules through inexorable happiness


<a id="org29bdd06"></a>

### Friends

Deranged malcontent, Bloody-handed guerrilla leader of a rebellion of
madmen, Outsider trying to find a way to reverse the utopian changes


<a id="org30437c5"></a>

### Complications

The natives really are deeply and contentedly happy with their altered
lot, The utopia produces something that attracts others, The utopia
works on converting outsiders through persuasion and generosity, The
utopia involves some sacrifice that's horrifying to non-members


<a id="org6475ead"></a>

### Things

Portable device that applies the utopian change, Plans for a device
that would destroy the utopia, Goods created joyfully by the locals


<a id="orgb18c2ff"></a>

### Places

Plaza full of altered humans, Social ritual site, Secret office where
“normal” humans rule


<a id="tag-warlords"></a>

## Warlords

The world is plagued by warlords. Numerous powerful men and women
control private armies sufficiently strong to cow whatever local
government may exist. On the lands they claim, their word is law. Most
spend their time oppressing their own subjects and murderously
pillaging those of their neighbors. Most like to wrap themselves in
the mantle of ideology, religious fervor, or an ostensibly legitimate
right to rule.


<a id="org31624b0"></a>

### Enemies

Warlord, Avaricious lieutenant, Expensive assassin, Aspiring minion


<a id="org1d14848"></a>

### Friends

Vengeful commoner, Government military officer, Humanitarian aid
official, Village priest

## Xenophobes

The natives are intensely averse to dealings with outworlders. Whether
through cultural revulsion, fear of tech contamination, or a genuine
immunodeficiency, the locals shun foreigners from offworld and refuse
to have anything to do with them beyond the bare necessities of
contact. Trade may or may not exist on this world, but if it does, it
is almost certainly conducted by a caste of untouchables and outcasts.

# Atmosphere

The first step in randomized world generation is determining the
planet's atmosphere. In some cases, this is going to be preordained;
if you want a barren asteroid base, it's not going to have any
atmosphere at all. If you want a world teeming with human life, on the
other hand, it almost certainly is going to have a breathable
atmosphere.

Note that if a truly noxious atmosphere, climate, or biosphere turns
up on a random roll, you should think carefully about what has made
humans choose to live on such a world. Perhaps the original colonists
were prisoners exiled to an open-world prison. It could be their
ancestors sought isolation at all costs. Given its position in the
sector, it might be a vital refueling and trading port for multiple
short-run spike drive courses. The original colonists might have had
to make an emergency landing. Whatever the reason, it takes a powerful
motivation to make a band of colonists decide to make a corrosive,
burning hellhole of a planet their permanent home.


<a id="types-of-atmospheres"></a>

## Types of Atmospheres

***Corrosive atmospheres*** are dangerously hostile to conventional vacc
suits and other protective gear. They steadily strip away at a suit's
vent ports, wiring connections, and other weak spots until they
eventually break through and flood the suit with a toxic cocktail that
usually kills a victim in seconds. Weak atmospheres might require as
much as a day to degrade a vacc suit, while strong ones might
accomplish the job in an hour. Even forcefield-based environment suits
such as a FEP suffer steady damage to their exposed elements.

Native vacc suits are usually covered with an ablative layer or spray
that can be regularly renewed, and their buildings often rely on a
steadily-extruded slurry of neutralizing materials that can be
constantly renewed by pores in the building surface itself. This often
gives the building a drippy, half-melted look that may be more than
cosmetic in the case of those structures that have failing slurry
pumps. Advanced tech level 5 equipment may be able to overcome the
effects, but even pretech is often taxed by the relentless rigors of
this world. Vehicles and shuttles are kept in pressurized garages when
not in use, and starships never land for long.

Corrosive worlds have a number of intrinsic adventure complications,
the largest being the way that every activity outside of a hab
building comes with a built-in time limit. Whatever the party chooses
to do outside of a building, it has to accomplish before their suit
seals fail or the atmosphere corrodes a hole in their vehicle hull. A
clever GM can use this problem to add extra tension to an otherwise
simple task.

***Inert gas*** atmospheres aren't hostile or poisonous, but they're
unbreathable by humans. If the planet's climate is otherwise
tolerable, the natives might be able to live and work outdoors without
anything more than an air tank and face mask. Some degree of technical
sophistication is going to be necessary for humanity to survive, and
large supplies of oxygen are going to have to be extracted from some
local source. “Air mines” might exist to replace the oxygen lost
during human use, or local power plants might need to be kept running
full blast in order to crack water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

On worlds with an unbreathable atmosphere, control of the air supply
makes it much harder for locals to rebel against their leaders.
Without the equipment and power to generate their own air supplies,
would-be rebels are entirely at the mercy of those who control the
oxygen. Most rulers pick up on this fact rapidly, and some worlds with
unbreathable atmospheres might even make it a crime to own illicit
oxygen generation equipment.

***Airless or thin atmospheres*** are appropriate to asteroids, rocky
planetoids, or barren worlds that have had their atmospheres burnt off
by weapons or cosmic caprice. Whatever atmosphere exists is too thin
to support human life, if it exists at all, and the world is largely
naked to the chill of space and the blaze of stellar heat. Exposure to
the planet's surface without a vacc suit or pressurized building is as
lethal as exposure to hard vacuum.

Airless worlds are hostile to human life, but they excel at preserving
the relics of the past. Provided that the ruins or remains are kept
out of the baking heat of the local stellar body and the impact of
random meteorites, they can survive for millions of years. Some
exceptionally ancient alien ruins might even date back from before the
world lost its atmosphere.

***Breathable mix*** atmospheres can support human life without
additional equipment or engineered modification. Any world that has a
human population in the millions or more almost certainly has a
breathable mix atmosphere.

While the air is breathable, almost every world has its own subtle
cocktail of inert gases, atmospheric contaminants, and other
odoriferous ingredients. For spacers accustomed to the filtered air
supply of a starship, the “new world stink” of a fresh planetfall can
be maddening, as few linger long enough to get used to the smell of
the local air. Attempting to explain the source of this discomfort to
the locals rarely results in positive results. Some spaceport bars
make a point of their air filtration and composition mixers.

***Thick atmospheres*** can usually be breathed with the aid of a filter
mask, though the mix of contaminants renders it slowly or quickly
toxic to humans who attempt to breathe it straight. Separate air
supplies are not necessary to supplement the blend, but any society
that means to survive on such a world must have sufficient
technological expertise to manufacture and maintain large numbers of
filter masks.

Thick atmospheres are often at least semi-opaque, and some worlds have
thick atmospheres that are completely impenetrable to ordinary
light. Deep banks of permanent fog might shroud the planet, or natives
might have to go about with sophisticated ultraviolet or infrared
viewing equipment if they don't wish to be blind. Some banks of gases
might be impenetrable to even these viewing tools, leaving a party
vulnerable to moments of complete blindness while out on the surface
of the world.

***Invasive*** toxic atmospheres are composed of a substantial
proportion of molecules small enough to infiltrate past the seals of
most vacc suits. This infiltration doesn't harm the suit, but the
molecules have to be steadily flushed by the system's purification
sensors before they build up to a debilitating level. This causes a
much faster bleed of air as breathable oxygen is jettisoned along with
the infiltrating molecules. Most invasive atmospheres cut oxygen
supply durations by half, at best.

Invasive atmospheres make oxygen an even more important resource than
it is on inert gas worlds. Outdoor work is avoided whenever possible,
as any failure of a suit's toxin sensors or flush system can lead to
death before the wearer even realizes something is wrong. Steady
exposure to low levels of the toxins can also result in unfortunate
effects even with a fully-functional suit. Hallucinations, chronic
sickness, or worse can follow.

***Corrosive and invasive*** atmospheres exist at the very border of
what human society can tolerate. Combining all the worst traits of an
eroding, corrosive atmosphere and the invasive intrusion of toxic
molecules, a planet cursed with an atmosphere like this is far more
hostile than any mere airless rock.

Advanced pretech filtering and oxygen generation equipment might be
able to maintain tolerable pressurized habitats and hydroponic systems
uncontaminated by exterior atmosphere. Anything less than this tech
level means greater and greater amounts of societal resources devoted
simply to the effort of breathing. Entire civilizations can be
oriented around overcoming the difficulties of maintaining their
structures and their pressurized homes.

Whatever provoked the initial inhabitants to settle on this world must
have been of overwhelming value or necessity to convince them to
consign themselves and their children to such a place. It is highly
unlikely that enough ship traffic exists to get any but the most
fortunate locals offworld, so the rest are obliged to deal with their
harsh existence as best they can.


<a id="temperature"></a>

## Temperature

A world's average temperature depends in large part upon its
atmosphere. Worlds with an airless or thin atmosphere are directly
exposed to the wild temperature variations produced by stellar
radiation and the cold void of space, and might flip regularly between
unendurable heat and near-absolute zero depending on planetary
rotation and orbit.

If a GM intends this planet to have a large human population they
should restrict the possibility of a frozen or burning world. Anything
that is intolerable to a human without a vacc suit means that major
agriculture is unlikely. As it is effectively impossible to feed
entire planets through limited interstellar trade, every planet needs
to support its own population. A world that can't grow food outside of
hydroponic labs or underground farms is unlikely to support millions
of people.


<a id="types-of-climates"></a>

## Types of Climates

***Frozen*** worlds are those with so weak a stellar primary or so great
a distance that the average temperature is close to absolute zero. Any
atmosphere that once existed has long since frozen into drifts of
solidified oxygen or lakes of liquid helium. Exposure to these drifts
is very dangerous. Vacc suits maintain a tolerable temperature easily
because the stellar void is very empty, and there is little conduction
of heat between the suit and empty space. Dunking a suit into a lake
of thermally-conductive superchilled liquid can force the heating
elements into sudden and drastic overload, draining a power cell in
minutes or even seconds.

***Cold*** worlds are uncomfortable, but a human can survive on them in
nothing more than heavy clothing.

The worst of the cold worlds are similar in condition to Earth's
Antarctic regions, barren wastes of ice and wind. The more clement
ones have brief warmer seasons or equatorial bands that get enough
solar radiation to support substantial agriculture.

On cold worlds, agricultural land is at a premium. The population is
unlikely to be willing to limit its numbers to what hydroponic farms
can provide, and they may lack the technology for wide-scale
artificial production methods. Savage wars may have broken out over
control of fertile growing regions, and populations have perhaps been
driven away from the arable land into the cold zones and a lingering
death.

Some worlds retain installations from before the Silence deep within
the frozen wastes, ancient bases and laboratories that were planted in
an age when good launch sites and orbital windows meant more than
trifles of temperature. These lost sites might be remembered in legend
and story, and some native leaders might still be in possession of the
automatic defense bypass codes handed down by their ancestors.

***Temperate*** worlds were the most popular colony sites, and most of
the truly populous worlds of the frontier have a temperate
climate. Many temperate worlds have temperature ranges not unlike that
of Earth, though most are canted a little further toward cold or heat
depending on their angle and proximity to the local star.

</table>

Temperate worlds are the most likely to teem with native life as well,
and to have alien ruins or remains located somewhere on their
surface. Most frontier worlds never accumulated enough population to
put a serious strain on a temperate world's arable land, but this same
capaciousness often allows for more complicated social divisions to
develop. Natives of other worlds are often forced to cooperate or die,
while those of a clement temperate world have the luxury of deep and
lasting divisions.

***Warm*** worlds come in two main flavors, depending on the prevalence
of water. “Desert worlds” are hot enough or arid enough to be deprived
of most surface water. Any life on such a planet has to be capable of
extracting water from living prey, air currents or moisture supplies
deep underground.

Humans can survive on warm worlds without more than appropriate
clothing, but desert-world humans must learn sophisticated techniques
of water prospecting and well-drilling in order to maintain their
agricultural systems. Warfare often revolves around these water
systems.

The other common variety of warm world is one blessed with an
abundance of surface water. These worlds tend to be covered with plant
and animal life, teeming with thick jungles and vast mats of sargasso
on seas that boil with piscids and other alien life analogs. These
worlds can be quite prosperous for humans if the native life is
edible, but inhabitants are often forced to deal with large predators
and a vigorously ingenious native ecology of disease.

***Variable temperature*** worlds tend to show a greater distribution of
climates than other worlds, either ranging from cold to temperate
levels or temperate to hot levels. This may be a climate that changes
world-wide when a long, slow orbit brings the planet into proximity
with a stellar primary, or it might be a world that has substantially
different climatic zones spread across its surface. The north pole of
one world might be a sun-blasted desert that moderates to a cool, wet
equator, or an icy world might be warmed here and there by complex
channels of geothermally-heated subsurface rivers. Variable
temperature worlds tend to have savage weather. The mixing of hot and
cold air can send ferocious cyclones and raging hurricanes across the
surface of the world, some large enough to consume most of a
hemisphere.

***Burning*** worlds are too hot for a human to survive without
equipment similar to a vacc suit in effectiveness. Rivulets of molten
lead or copper might bleed from open veins on the hillsides, and many
of the same perils that face an explorer on a frozen world have hotter
equivalents on a burning one. Ash drifts, pools of molten metal, and
superheated liquid vents can bring quick death to an unwary explorer,
and the miners who inhabit such worlds must be forever vigilant
against the perils of their burning home.


<a id="climate-and-adventure"></a>

## Climate and Adventure

Any planet with Burning or Frozen conditions is going to need some
kind of sealed habitat for humanity. Worlds of Cold or Warm
temperatures are at least habitable outside of their most extreme
zones, though icy planets might not have much arable land on the
outside.

As a consequence, planets with Frozen or Burning temperatures tend to
have the climate as a backdrop rather than something the PCs regularly
need to deal with. If they've landed on such a world's spaceport, it's
probably sealed in some subterranean hangar-cavern or domed over by
massive civil engineering. The ice or flame might be a constant
concern of the locals, but the PCs aren't going to have to cope with
it unless they have to leave the inhabited regions of the planet.

On Burning worlds, this isn't going to happen very often. Any habitat
without active climate control is going to be melted or torched by
local conditions in short order. There will be no ruins to explore or
remnants to recover unless they're somehow fireproof.

The easiest use of a Burning world's temperature is as a threat to the
locals or the PCs. If something isn't fixed, or if something is
destroyed, or if some place isn't evacuated in time, then things will
get intolerably hot. There's usually a grace period of increasing
temperature to help add urgency to the situation and layer on
potential penalties or dangers as the PCs struggle to cope with the
situation.

Frozen worlds can be equally lethal if a flood of liquid oxygen
threatens to sweep through a habitat or a cold-brittled vital
component breaks down. More significantly to PCs, however, frozen
worlds tend to be much better about preserving ruins and remains. The
PCs might be forced to deal with the frigid temperatures as they
search through an alien structure or the icy halls of a dead
habitat. Such conditions can lead to strict time limits on an
expedition before materials start to brittle and fail under the
relentless chill.


<a id="biosphere"></a>

## Biosphere

Some worlds are highly unlikely to have a biosphere. An airless rock,
a frozen wasteland, or a world of boiling tin all are unlikely to host
any sort of life more sophisticated than microbes, though the universe
has demonstrated the existence of a few exotic creatures even on
seemingly unendurable planets.

The real question of a biosphere is whether or not it's edible.
Colonists on a world without edible local life are forced to seed and
grow Terran crops, which may well be outcompeted by native life
specifically evolved for this world. Such colonists might well end up
starving amid gardens of alien fruit, unable to digest any of it. The
only benefit of such worlds is the likelihood that humans are just as
poisonous to local life, though many large predators don't realize
that until after they devour some luckless colonist.


<a id="types-of-biosphere"></a>

## Types of Biosphere

***Biosphere remnants*** are the wreckage of a ruined ecology. Petrified
trees, drifts of preserved bones, forests of dead plant life;
something killed all the life on this planet in the relatively recent
past. It may have been the exercise of a maltech planet-buster weapon,
or a mutant microbe introduced by human colonists, or some volcanic
eruption or asteroid impact that plunged the world into decades of
frozen night.

Any local civilization not sophisticated enough to escape the planet
likely died when it did. Their ruins and remains might be found
throughout the desolate wastes, along with more clues as to the cause
of the devastation.

***Microbial*** life is often the only thing that exists on the more
inhospitable planets, yet the wide variety of environments that can
accommodate life means that these little beasts show up in some of the
most unlikely places. Some varieties of slime mold have even managed
to evolve on corrosive-atmosphere planets, forming a mucous-like outer
shell against the atmosphere and then feeding and growing off the
chemical byproducts of its erosion.

Microbial life can also be dangerous. While most alien microbes are
unable to infect or harm the radically different biology of humans,
some show enough ingenuity to accomplish even that difficult
feat. Rumors of terrible “space plagues” that leave behind only
drifting ships and garbled warnings remain a steady staple at spacer
bars throughout the known universe.

***No native biosphere*** is occasionally found on even the most
temperate and otherwise habitable worlds. For one reason or another,
life simply never evolved on these worlds, leaving them a blank slate
for the agricultural and ecological efforts of humans. If the world is
otherwise amenable to Terran life, such planets can be enormously
fertile and agriculturally rich.

They can also be disasters waiting to happen. Pretech xenobiologists
compiled standardized colonization packages of plants, animals, and
insect life designed to expand smoothly and evenly to fill the niches
of an uninhabited world. Not all colonists implemented these packages
correctly, and some worlds had disasters or special circumstances that
destabilized their efforts. Some empty worlds are now in a state of
constant biological flux as the local ecology strives vainly to find
some sort of equilibrium between the myriad imported species and their
violent struggle.

More subtly, these worlds can be suddenly and drastically destabilized
by the import of some offworld plant or animal. With no strong native
ecology to fight off interlopers, the wrong beast or bug can lay waste
to whole continents. These planets tend to be extremely paranoid about
importation of foreign life forms.

***Human-miscible biospheres*** are those in which some substantial
portion of the native life is biologically compatible with human
nutritional needs. The local plants and animals may not be tasty or
terribly nourishing, but they can support life without the serious
importation of Terran crop seeds and livestock.

Even the friendlier human-miscible biospheres often lack the wide
variety of edibles that evolved on Earth, and the natives often
supplement their stocks of local foods with limited Terran
agriculture. Exotic foods, spices, and liquors can be worth
interstellar importation to feed the hunger for novelty possessed by
the elites on these worlds.

Unfortunately, the fact that humans can eat some native life means
that it is very likely that some native life can eat humans as well.
Large predators and diseases capable of human infection are by no
means uncommon on these worlds, and small colonies can be hard-pressed
to survive them.

***Immiscible biospheres*** are not friendly to humans. None of the
local plants or animals are edible, and anything the colony needs to
eat will have to be grown from Terran stock. Worse, it is common for
the pollen and other microbial life of these worlds to be highly
allergenic to humans, requiring the regular use of tailored
antiallergenics to prevent eventual respiratory failure or exotic
immune-system reactions.

These worlds are exceptionally susceptible to the temptation of human
gengineering. Despite the persistent drawbacks, genetic flaws, and
handicaps that human gengineering usually introduces in a subject, the
desperate need to eat can drive worlds to wholesale experimentation on
their progeny. The resultant altered humans are often able to digest
the local food, but commonly pay for it in shortened life spans,
physical disabilities, or an inability to consume Terran
foodstuffs. Sometimes the consequences are worse still.

Immiscible biospheres produce some of the most exotic plants and
animals in human space. Unfettered by the limits of familiar
evolutionary patterns, creatures of bizarre beauty and strange
configurations are found on many of these worlds. Many lack the
intelligence to realize that humans are as poisonous to them as they
are to humans.

***Hybrid biospheres*** are a stable intermixing of Terran flora and
fauna with local life forms. Most such worlds have been colonized for
centuries before the Silence, giving the local ecology time to shake
out into a relatively stable configuration of Earth-born organisms and
native life. The native biology may or may not be miscible with human
life, but it is unlikely to be particularly hostile in any case, or
else the interloping life forms would not have been able to get a
foothold on the planet.

Hybrid biospheres often show strange examples of symbiosis and
adaptation, with plants and animals forming new alliances. Large
predators from one world may find themselves subsisting on herds of
herbivorous alien life, while Terran vegetation provides sustenance
for large populations of small, furred, insect-like grazers. Familiar
animals may show seemingly bizarre behavior patterns that have formed
in response to local conditions, perhaps becoming larger or more
aggressive, or having been gengineered for compatibility.

***Engineered biospheres*** are among the rarest, as they require
enormous time and effort on the part of a highly advanced
civilization. Whatever life exists on this planet has been extensively
altered by an alien race or by advanced pretech gengineering
methods. Some such worlds are paradise planets, carefully sculpted by
some fabulously wealthy predecessor to suit their own tastes. Others
are living forges, where foodstuffs and refined minerals are produced
as byproducts from the basic organic processes of the world's
biosphere.

Such worlds tend to be fragile. Many engineered worlds are dependent
upon regular stabilizing work to prevent genetic drift and adaptations
that do not serve the creator's purpose. Without regular pruning and
adjustment, engineered biospheres can go badly awry. Some end up
leaving nothing but genetic wreckage in their wake, while others go
wrong in more subtle ways. Where once the biosphere existed to serve
the inhabitants, a creaking engineered biosphere can leave the
planet's population chained to constant repair and maintenance efforts
just to prevent a planetary collapse.


<a id="population"></a>

## Population

Planetary populations hinge on a world's habitability. Worlds
incapable of growing food on the planet's surface are unlikely to have
more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants at best, and truly
inimical worlds might be lucky to have a tenth as many. As a rule of
thumb, a world ought to have some kind of human habitation on it
unless the GM has a specific purpose for it in mind. A world untouched
by human presence can be interesting in many ways, but without
elaboration there's little to distinguish it from the next airless
ball of rock.

Humans breed quickly, and will tend to push up against the limits of a
world's capacity to feed and support them. Some cultures with
sufficient tech might rely on contraceptives and birth licensing to
ensure sufficient food for its population, while others might choose
or be forced to leave matters to simple Malthusian culling. Wars and
diseases may also serve as a check on population, or in some cases,
cultures may find themselves so wealthy, self-absorbed and comfortable
as to voluntarily choose not to reproduce.


<a id="population-sizes"></a>

## Population Sizes

***Failed colonies*** are occasionally found dotting the worlds of human
space. Some date back to the First Wave of human colonization more
than a thousand years ago, while others are more recent efforts that
guttered out under the strains of a colony's birth.

Pirate attacks might have wiped out a young colony, as might a hostile
biosphere, alien attack, internal dissension, disease outbreaks,
failure of vital colonial equipment, or any one of a hundred other
disasters. The ruins of the colony might still have valuable pretech
artifacts, however, or colonization deeds authorized by neighboring
worlds. A few survivors might even have clung to life in the
intervening centuries, maintaining some sort of society in the
wreckage of their ancestors' work.

***Outposts*** are rarely composed of more than a few hundred or few
thousand colonists at the most. Outposts are either very new colonies
that have not have the requisite time to grow or they are uncolonized
worlds that just happen to have a naval or corporate base on the
surface.

Corporate or military outposts aren't intended to be completely
self-sufficient. While large outposts are often forced to raise their
own food supplies, replacement personnel, spare parts, and advanced
tech must all be brought in from elsewhere. Such temporary outposts
are known to find themselves in sudden distress when a vital supply
ship fails to make its drop or when some local threat proves more than
the staff can handle.

Colonial outposts tend to be better equipped but with less outside
backing. Such natives expect to live and die on the world, and are
more inclined to build permanent structures and local improvements.
Many are exiles, malcontents, or others incapable of tolerating the
world that sent them forth, and it can make for a somewhat explosive
mix in a young colony. These pioneers tend to be very friendly towards
visiting starships, as they are often dependent upon free traders and
tramp merchants to bring them vital supplies or news of the sector.

Some “outposts” are really just the stubborn, persistent survivors of
a long-failed colonization attempt. These cultures can survive for
centuries, perpetually culled by the dangers of the world until the
survivors are little more than one more ragged element of the local
ecology.

***Fewer than a million inhabitants*** are often found on
newly-colonized worlds, or those with limited arable land. This class
has the widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to
avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals
struggling against hostile local conditions.

For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be
clustered close to one another for mutual support and efficient
exploitation of land. The atmosphere might be something like that of a
village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support large,
specialized cities. The major settlement of the planet is usually
built around the spaceport.

Politics on planets with so few people tend to be very personal in
nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population
of a world at a single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and
employees can dominate the local social life.

This small population combined with limited outside contact can result
in somewhat&#x2026;/unusual/ societies more strongly influenced by a
leader's personal quirks than a more populous planet might be. Some
such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and
traditions.

Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up the population of many
frontier worlds, usually ones with adequate supplies of arable land
and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or
filter mask. This level of population is also usually the most that a
world at TL4 can support using only artificial hydroponic complexes
and sealed agricultural systems, so less hospitable planets rarely
have more than this many inhabitants.

At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub
settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might
exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations
start to become present as towns and smaller settlements start to
assert their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have much of a
framework for resolving these new tensions, and it's not uncommon for
outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions.

A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally the smallest population
that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds
rarely have the broad range of specialists and workers necessary to
build such ships, even if they possess the necessary technical
information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of
astronautic industry would require the determined focus of the entire
society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there
enough of an industrial margin to allow for less determined
construction of spike drive starships.

***Millions of inhabitants*** are found on some of the more populous
frontier worlds, those planets with an excellent climate and soil for
agriculture. These worlds teem with human life compared to most of
their neighbors, and if they have sufficient technological expertise
to build spike drives, they probably are among the significant powers
of the sector. The sheer amount of labor and expertise they can put
into their projects dwarfs the capabilities of less populated worlds.

Some worlds of this type fail to coalesce under a unified planetary
government, however, and turn most of their attention to
intra-planetary quarrels between different nations or city-states.
Full-scale planetary wars have been known to break out on such worlds,
with some being reduced to burnt-out cinders by some maltech weapon or
by nuclear attacks against regions stripped of their nuke snuffers.

***Billions of inhabitants*** on a world is a freak occurrence in most
sectors, a circumstance dependent on almost perfect planetary
conditions, a First Wave date of colonization, a very large initial
colonial expedition, and a strong cultural imperative for
reproduction. These worlds have been colonized for almost a thousand
years, and have likely gone through substantial cultural development
and change since their founding.

Planets with this many inhabitants tend to come in two main
varieties. The more common is that of regional hegemon, leveraging its
enormous reserves of labor and scientific personnel to build hundreds
or thousands of starships. Some hegemons might even have the transport
weight and personnel available to colonize or conquer their less
powerful neighbors outright, though most hegemons prefer the safer
route of docile client states rather than outright conquest.

Not all such worlds have the necessary resources to build starships,
even when the labor is cheap and abundant. These worlds tend to take a
different route, becoming balkanized, conflict-torn planets not unlike
a mid-20th-century Earth. Resource wars are common and local politics
revolve around byzantine feuds and ancient slights. Technology on such
planets tends to be very uneven; it is limited or nonexistent in
fields that depend on unavailable resources, but the natives often
show remarkable sophistication in making the most of what they have
available.

***Alien civilizations*** are even rarer than massively human-populated
planets, but they can be found in some sectors. On these worlds, any
human presence is either nonexistent or simply a token contingent of
traders and diplomats. The actual number of aliens may range from a
few tens of thousands to teeming worlds of billions.

Alien civilizations appear to be no more immune to conflict, disaster,
and decadence than that of humans, and most alien worlds are isolated
planets. Some sectors were known to be dominated by alien empires
before the Scream, but most inhabited worlds found by colonial
surveyors consisted of indigenous, lowtech sapients who evolved on the
world, or else were the decaying remnants of a former empire that had
fallen apart into isolated colonial worlds.

This fate of growth, expansion, colonization, and collapse appears to
be a very common event in the galaxy. Countless alien ruins and lost
deep-space artifacts indicate that cycles of growth and decay have
been going on for millennia, and there is little way to tell how many
alien empires have swept over what is now human space before dwindling
to rotting worlds and then empty ruins.


<a id="population-growth"></a>

## Population Growth

Most worlds have reached an equilibrium state with their current
populations. While there may be some variation, few worlds are likely
to increase much without a drastic change in the local conditions.

For primitive worlds, this limit has been reached in brutally
Malthusian fashion. The locals simply cannot support any substantial
increase of their numbers, and additional population is restricted by
widespread contraceptive use, selective infanticide, or regular bouts
of mass starvation. The only way out of this trap is through advanced
technology that can overcome the local resource limitations, after
which such worlds might explode in population over a scant few
decades.

For more advanced worlds, this limit tends to be organic to the
culture. With sophisticated technology to supply abundant
entertainment and sustenance, there is less importance in having
offspring to labor for the family or nourish its aged
members. Individuals become more interested in their own pleasures and
ambitions than in the burdensome work of child-rearing, and population
tends to slope downward until cultural mores reinforce a certain basic
minimum of reproduction. A drastic change in cultural attitudes or an
increase in societal uncertainty can alter this rapidly.


<a id="tech-level"></a>

## Tech Level

The tech level of a world represents not only the level of
technological progress and scientific knowledge available on it, but
also the world's ability to translate that knowledge into effective
production. A world might still guard texts describing elaborate
principles of petrochemical manipulation, but without oil or fossil
fuels on the planet they have no way to use the information. It is
this kind of resource limitation that most often keeps a world caught
at a low level of tech. Without bottleneck resources such as
petrochemicals or radioactives, they can't develop the technology that
would allow them to do without such resources.

Tech level 4 is the baseline level of development for planets capable
of building fusion plants, spike-drive equipped starships, limited
longevity enhancements, and basic energy weapons. A planet without
this level of development is effectively cut off from interstellar
news and trade without the good offices of far traders, explorers, or
scavenger fleet contacts.

Tech levels are rough approximations, and every planet is going to
have variance within that range. A decayed colony is unlikely to have
forgotten the basics of human anatomy and practical wound care, but
they may not have the local resources to fashion medical tools more
sophisticated than obsidian scalpels and herbal poultices. By the same
token, a primitive world might have local resources that are
exceptionally useful in one or two narrow ranges of technology.


<a id="planetary-tech-levels"></a>

## Planetary Tech Levels

***Tech level 0*** represents a world with technologies similar to
neolithic-era humanity. Very few worlds collapse this far without
dying out completely, and so a world this primitive is very rare in
human space. The world is so profoundly devoid of useful resources
that the natives may simply not have anything better to work with than
rocks and native vegetation.

Natives of a world at this tech level might retain elaborate cultural
artifacts and a very sophisticated society. Existing resources tend to
be exploited to the hilt, with large populations producing massive
stone cities, human-powered engines for irrigation, and vast displays
of foodstuffs and craft work for the ruling class. Despite this, the
lack of metal, domesticated beasts of burden, and petrochemicals puts
a hard stop on the technological development of most of these worlds.

Responses to far traders and other interstellar travelers will vary
with the local culture. The lack of quick communications methods tends
to result in large populations breaking up into numerous smaller
regional cultures, and the friendly prince of one domain might
neighbor an implacably hostile sage-king. Most “lostworlders” have a
keen appreciation for the benefits these strangers from the sky can
bring them, and will bargain accordingly.

Some worlds might retain crisply rational records of their
colonization and downfall. Others might preserve tales of a starry
origin in legends and story. A few might have forgotten their origins
entirely, and view sky-born humans as gods or messengers of the
divine. Such awe rarely lasts very long once the merchants or pirates
who landed make their purposes clear.

***Tech level 1*** worlds have managed to find and exploit metal
deposits and likely have imported or domesticated beasts of
burden. Those worlds with easy access to fossil fuels or a similarly
energy-dense substance can advance to greater things, but a culture
trapped at TL1 is unlikely to have access to such helpful resources. A
few worlds have enough usable plant matter or other combustibles to
make steam engines feasible, but those with very much of such a
resource usually make the leap to the next tech level eventually.

As a consequence, tech level 1 worlds tend to be caught at much the
same general level of development as their tech level 0 cousins. They
may have elaborate social structures and cultural development, but
they are unable to mechanize without some energy-dense resource to
serve as fuel. The scavenged hulks of their ancestors' fusion plants
may stand as mute temples to the achievements of their forebears, but
without the tech necessary to repair and rebuild such edifices the
world is dependent on purely local fuel sources.

</table>

Tech level 1 worlds tend to respond to visitors in much the same way
as tech level 0 planets. The ruling class of these worlds is liable to
be able to muster larger cities, bigger armies, and all the other
perquisites that come from being able to work the available
agricultural land with fewer hands.

***Tech level 2*** worlds are blessed with the presence of fossil fuels
or a feasibly abundant biofuel source. Internal combustion engines are
crude things compared to the power of a fusion plant, but they can be
built with primitive tools and a basic degree of education. The
mechanization that results from this resource vastly increases the
efficiency of local farming, the speed of travel, and the productivity
of factory workers.

Most tech level 2 worlds are “knockdowns”; planets that once had a
much higher degree of sophistication but were recently crippled by
disease, disaster, or invasion. The natives tend to be keenly aware of
the glories of former generations, and work fiercely to redevelop lost
techniques and reclaim old knowledge.

Few tech level 2 worlds produce much that's worth interstellar
trade. Most foodstuffs are too bulky and cheap to make it worth a
captain's time. Some worlds have rare ore deposits, but the natives
have no reason to dig them until a merchant makes it worth their while
to set up a whole new industry for export. Some such worlds barter the
relics of their ancestors in exchange for educational materials or
rare resources necessary for advancing local industry. Others feel
forced to trade native work contracts for dangerous, dirty labor in a
bargain that's little different from slave trading.

***Tech level 3*** worlds are those that have developed to a level much
like that of the more advanced nations of late twentieth-century
Earth. The main difference between tech level 3 worlds and level 4
worlds is the lack of fusion power or spike drive manufacture.

These worlds come in two major varieties. The first is a “knockdown”
world that formerly had tech level 4 technologies before some
catastrophe or pirate attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial
base. Some of the wrecked infrastructure might have been
irreplaceable, and the world must struggle to regain its former level
of technological production. Worlds in this condition tend to have
rather small populations that are susceptible to the loss of a few
concentrated groups of experts.

The second major variety is a world that suffered a severe disaster
shortly after colonization and has been forced to painstakingly build
up their technological base ever since. Some of these worlds date back
to the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago, driven into
near-neolithic conditions by some outside pressure before slowly and
painfully rebuilding their technological base through purely
indigenous efforts. These worlds tend to have very large populations
if the world's climate permits, as they have been colonized for quite
some time.

Simply providing a world with the necessary technical data for
advancement doesn't mean that advancement will be quick or even. Even
if a tech level 3 world has the necessary resources to build tech
level 4 devices, it may take as much as a generation for a world to
build the necessary infrastructure and resource extraction
enterprises. The time may be longer still if the dominant cultures are
uneasy with the new technology.

***Tech level 4*** worlds are the most common in human space, and their
technical expertise is the baseline for modern post-Silence “postech”.
These worlds can create spike drives rated up to drive-3, fusion power
plants, grav vehicles, simple energy weapons, and medicines that
extend human life to a hundred years of vigorous good health. They can
manage sophisticated gengineering on simple life forms, and some tech
level 4 worlds have even attempted to improve the genetic structures
of human life itself. These attempts have yet to produce results
without severe drawbacks, but some such worlds remain populated by
altered humanity designed to cope with local conditions more perfectly
than baseline humans.

Most worlds with regular interstellar contact and the necessary raw
resources eventually gravitate towards this level of technological
expertise. It may take decades, or even centuries in the case of more
retrograde worlds, but this tech level is the highest that can readily
be achieved by most planets.

***Tech level 4 with specialties*** is an unusual case of a normal tech
level 4 world that has retained some pretech industries or has
developed their own local technical expertise beyond baseline postech
in certain specific fields.

Most such specialties are relatively narrow in scope; grav tech,
medicine, hydroponics, force field generation, or some field of
roughly similar breadth. These specialties are usually either the
product of a few irreplaceable pretech manufactories or the result of
some unique local resource that serves amazingly well for the purpose
at hand. In both cases, the world will jealously guard the tech, and
much local conflict may relate to control over these resources.

These worlds tend to have substantial amounts of interstellar trade
from neighboring worlds interested in their tech. The ruling elite of
the world can be ostentatious about display of this wealth.

***Tech level 5*** is the highest tech level that might merit random
placement. A world with this level of technological expertise has
somehow managed to hold on to the majority of the pre-Scream
technology base, and can produce a wide range of goods that are
unknown on less sophisticated worlds. Miniaturized fusion plants,
drive-6 rated spike drives, exotic grav weaponry, and even the
development of psionics-based “psitech” is possible on such a world.

Pretech manufacturing was largely dependent on specially-trained
industrial psychics. With the loss of their unique disciplines in the
Scream, most worlds that retain this level of tech classification were
forced to substitute slower, less precise methods that sharply
curtailed their production efficiency. Barring the profoundly unlikely
happenstance of this world's redevelopment of the lost disciplines,
their maximum industrial output is sharply limited. Even on worlds
such as this, most technology is likely mass-produced postech, with
only important goods produced to pretech levels of quality.

A world with this level of technology is almost certainly a regional
hegemon, one of the most powerful and influential worlds in the
sector. Even those worlds that have no imperial ambitions have
enormous influence simply through the vast superiority of their
starships and military technology.


<a id="additional-system-points-of-interest"></a>

## Additional System Points of Interest

The world you're creating is the most interesting or important place
in this solar system, but it may not be the only one. If you wish, you
can decorate the system with other points of interest worth PC
attention. You might do this at the same time you roll up the system's
primary world, or you could wait until it becomes a significant point
in play.


<a id="adding-other-worlds"></a>

## Adding Other Worlds

For simplicity's sake, it's often best to just stick with one
inhabited world. The original colonists would have chosen the most
human-habitable planet in the system, and unless they grew
dramatically in the time before the Scream they wouldn't have had
reason to colonize less favorable planets before the catastrophe
knocked out their spaceflight capabilities. Other rocks might be
floating in the system, but they're probably barren and uninhabited.

If you do decide to add additional inhabited planets to the system,
you can generate them normally, but you'll want to ask yourself a few
special questions. The table below offers some ideas for potential
answers.

First, what is the origin of the world, and how does it relate to the
primary world in the system? Knowing where this secondary planet's
inhabitants came from can often give you answers to a host of other
questions.

Second, how do they feel about the primary world? If you generate
three or more worlds, you'll want to decide how each of them feels
about the other. This feeling may not necessarily be reciprocal.

Third, what's the major point of contact between them and the primary
world? If the two are on a friendly basis, this contact might be
something that benefits them both, while a more hostile relationship
could make it a point they're fighting over or otherwise struggling to
maintain dominance in. In the case of a mutual threat, it might be
something both are facing with a united front, or it could be the two
are struggling to see who gets thrown to the wolves first.

With these three answers in hand you'll be able to flesh out this
second planet more easily, adding in elements from the primary world
as needed.


<a id="other-points-of-interest"></a>

## Other Points of Interest

Aside from other inhabited planets, a system can contain a number of
other settlements or stations that could draw PC attention. Most of
the time these stations can simply be assumed; a TL4 world is going to
have asteroid mines and refueling stations and listening posts, and
most of these locations have no importance to the game until the PCs
go looking for them.

Other times, however, you'll want to pre-seed the system with a few
interesting locations. The adjacent table offers a number of different
possibilities to roll or choose from.

Most of the points are intended to be remote outposts of the primary
world. They might be deep-space research stations, refueling stations
on the edge of the system, bases on isolated gas-giant moons that have
valuable resources, or other farflung tendrils of a greater
civilization.

Some of these points could be more independent establishments. A
deep-space existence can be made largely self-sustaining with TL4
engineering, though the life there is likely primitive and
tenuous. With enough cobbled-together defenses and a lack of anything
particularly worth stealing, exile groups, recluses, and other
antisocial sorts can make themselves a private domain that no local
planet cares about enough to commit the resources required to destroy
it.

Others among these remote stations become outposts for pirates and
other reavers, usually operating under some deniable cover or
protected by enough defensive installations to dissuade anything short
of a major military assault. The calculus for these robbers is simple;
the effort a planetary navy would have to make to get rid of them must
be more than the cost of tolerating their depredations.

Few of these anarchic outposts last for very long. The stronger and
more active they become, the more pressing it is for their victims to
take steps to disperse them. Barring some pirate king both charismatic
and foolhardy, most such outposts are primed for quick abandonment
when a fleet shows up on the sensors.

# ADVENTURE CREATION

After developing one or more worlds, a GM ought to have a fairly
substantial list of Friends, Enemies, Places, Complications, and
Things appropriate to a given planet. An experienced GM may well be
able to assemble an interesting adventure out of these pieces, but
even the most practiced designer might be hard-pressed to come up with
enough interesting setups to fill out an entire sector.

The method that follows is by no means the best or only way to devise
an adventure, but it's a procedure that will do the job for a working
GM. This method work best if you've already generated a world using
the tools in the Sector Creation chapter, but the basic outlines can
function even without such support.


<a id="identify-your-needs"></a>

# Identify Your Needs

The first step in creating an adventure is identifying what,
precisely, you need the adventure to do. If you've been following the
recommended pattern for running your campaign, the last session ended
with you asking the players what goal they wanted to pursue next
time. If this is for the first adventure to kick off a campaign, you
might need something that introduces the players to the setting and
gives them a short adventure to get them working together smoothly. If
you're creating backup content that you can deploy rapidly when the
players catch you off guard, then that might be a third sort of
purpose behind your work.

Whatever it is, you need to keep this basic goal in mind as you create
the adventure content. Adventures are created to be playable content
at the table, so it needs to work for you.

Often, players are somewhat equivocal when they tell you what sort of
effort they plan to make for the next session. Sometimes their
intentions will be clear and direct, such as pursuing a nemesis who
got away from them last time with a cargo hold full of alien
artifacts. Other times, it will be something more nebulous, like “Find
a good deal on cargo for our ship” or “Explore some of the alien ruins
you mentioned were on this world”, or “Do something really unkind to
the planetary duke who shot down our starship”.

When things are clear, you'll have an easy time creating an
adventure. If they're chasing the nemesis, you know you need to create
an adventure revolving around them pursuing this evildoer and
encountering plausible challenges on the way. If the guidance you've
been given is less precise, more of the details are up to you. You
might create an adventure about a “bargain” cargo deal that threatens
to go very bad, or draw up an alien ruin for them to explore, or
introduce a plucky band of anti-ducal rebels for the PCs to encounter,
along with the problems those rebels have. So long as what you're
making is logically connected to what they want from you, you'll be
able to deliver a fine time at the table.

Sometimes, however, the players ask for something you know is going to
be impossible, or something that you know will be rapidly reconsidered
by the group. Maybe the nemesis has fled into the bowels of an
ultra-high-security orbital citadel, or you know that the duke is
actually dying of biopsionic cancer and will be dead in a few more
days. If the information is available to the PCs, you can point this
out to them and let them reconsider their goals. They might give up on
pursuing the nemesis, for example, or change their goal to that of
finding some way to penetrate the defenses around the orbital
station. It's important not to completely shut down impractical plans,
but instead suggest alternate routes that might turn “impossible” into
merely “very difficult”.

Be willing to follow the players' lead on alternate routes. If there's
not a compelling reason to shoot down an idea or assumption about the
world, run with it. If they ask if there are rebels or traitors or spy
networks they might be able to contact to get the information they
need to crack the defenses, then tell them yes. If the players are
going to be kind enough to map out your adventure creation needs for
you, let them do the work unless there's a very good reason otherwise.

Other times, however, the players don't have the information they'd
need to realize that their intentions are impractical. You know
they're going to get ten minutes into the next session before they
realize that what they planned to do is totally impossible. You can't
write them an adventure that gives them a chance of succeeding at the
goal, not without violating common sense or already-established game
world facts, so what do you do in such situations? There are two
general ways to handle this: anticipate their next course of action,
or prepare filler content.

There are times when you can tell that the players are going to hit
the obstacle and immediately look for a way around it. Maybe they
discover the nemesis has fled to the orbital at the start of the next
adventure, but a convenient NPC suggests that there's a way to get the
passcodes onto the station if the PCs are able to contact a certain
information broker. You write the adventure to help you handle the
PCs' attempts to find and convince the broker to help them, because
you're confident that the group isn't going to just shrug and let the
nemesis go.

On other occasions, however, you don't have that confidence. You
really aren't sure what the PCs will decide to do when they see their
initial goal is impractical. In this case, you write some filler
content, designed to give the players something fun to do for the
session while they figure out their next plan. This sort of filler
content can often be written far in advance of its actual need, and
over the course of a long campaign it's likely you'll end up with
several sessions worth of this prep work kept ready in your GM folder,
available for deployment whenever the PCs start doing things you're
not prepared to handle yet. This section will include some specific
advice on how to build this kind of filler content and how to insert
it into play.

In the end, the goal at this stage is to have a clear idea of what
sort of content you need to have prepped for the next session. Once
you know what kind of material you need to make, you can go on to the
next stage.


<a id="choose-ingredients"></a>

# Choose Ingredients

The next step in creating the adventure is to look back at your sector
information and the tags and elements you've rolled up for the planet
the PCs are on. You've already created some NPCs, complications, and
places to work with, so now's your chance to take advantage of your
preparations. If the PCs are somewhere that hasn't had that work done
already, take a moment to fabricate an appropriate Friend, Enemy,
Complication, Thing, and Place suitable for the setting. You'll use
these ingredients to create the adventure in the next step.

While you can pull the ingredients directly from your sector file, you
can also take a moment to customize them to the situation. Maybe
there's a particular NPC you know is going to show up next time, given
the party's ambitions, or there's a specific macguffin that's in
circulation right now. You can adjust these ingredients to fit the
specific circumstances and help smooth transitions between adventures.
The same people can keep showing up when it's logical that they'd be
involved, and the other elements can persist to help give a sense of
continuity to events.

It's also useful to pull in regular callbacks from prior adventures.
The things that PCs do have consequences, and sometimes those
consequences persist for quite some time. Try to put at least one
callback to prior events or people into each adventure, even if it's
just a cameo from an NPC, or a newsflash giving up-to-date reporting
on some situation the PCs were involved in. The more that the PCs feel
like they're really making a difference in the campaign world, the
more engaged they're going to be with the setting.

Try to make sure that the ingredients you use are logical and coherent
elements of your campaign setting. Pulling antagonists or macguffins
from the starry void can be convenient, but an ingredient that just
comes out of nowhere, with no foreshadowing or visible connection to
the rest of the campaign, is an ingredient that some groups might find
jarring and difficult to interact with. In the absence of some visible
connection to the rest of the campaign, it's hard for a party to get
their hands around an ingredient and deduce intelligent, rational ways
to interact with it. A planetary tyrant they've known about for a few
sessions is much easier to deal with than an alien overlord fresh out
of drillspace, because the tyrant is part of a setting and context
they've had a chance to understand.


<a id="assemble-the-outline"></a>

# Assemble the Outline

With the adventure ingredients in hand, it's time to put together the
basic outline of the adventure. An outline isn't meant to fill in
every detail and supply every fact you need to run the adventure, but
merely to give you a basic idea of the adventure's premise and point
out the kind of information you'll need to prepare for play.

If you're pressed for time and don't feel like assembling your own
outline, flip forward in this section to a list of one hundred plot
seeds. Take your Friends, Enemies, Complications, and other world
elements and slot them into a seed that looks appropriate to your
needs. You now have your outline and can skip to the next step in
creating the adventure.

If you'd rather spend more time developing the outline, you'll want to
pick three basic elements to make up its essential frame. Not every
adventure involves all three elements, but usually you'll need
representative examples of each. You'll need a ***Problem*** to drive
the adventure, a - ***Person*** to serve as an antagonist or point of
entry to the Problem, and you'll need a ***Place*** to set the events as
they play out.

Your Problem is the core of your adventure, and is an unstable or
untenable situation that the PCs can meaningfully affect. The players
aren't going to care about problems so big or so intractable that
their actions won't have any consequential effect. They're going to be
engaged with problems small enough, or specific enough, that they feel
that their choices can really change the outcome.

Some Problems are self-attractive to the players. If the party wants
to explore an alien ruin on this world, then simply putting an
unexplored alien art museum where they can get at it will be
enticement enough. The Problem is that the PCs want what's inside the
museum, but there are some dangers or difficulties that are preventing
them from plundering its age-old secrets. Your job in that case will
be to make the overcoming of those difficulties interesting enough to
satisfy the players. Whenever you have a situation where the players
want X, your Problem can simply consist of placing X and then making
it plausibly difficult to get to.

Other times, this isn't going to be enough. Perhaps, the planet's
savage water barons are locked in a bloody struggle over control of
the ancient Mandate-era hydroforming installation, control of which
will leave one of them the undisputed master of the arid world.
Certainly, the services of a small band of recklessly courageous
adventurers could be vital in penetrating the installation's automatic
defenses, but why should the players care which tattooed savage gets
to be master?

The Person is your way of connecting the players with the Problem,
when the Problem is not one that naturally attracts their interest.
The Person provides the human connection between the party and the
situation, either through being a sympathetic figure who appeals to
the group's desire to help, or through being a dangerous antagonist
who forces a response.

Of course, an adventure can involve more than one important NPC, and
the players might end up with multiple reasons to engage with the
Problem. But by focusing on at least one important Person, you make
sure that the players have a real reason to care about the Problem and
provide yourself with a contact point through which to pass on
information about the situation. Even an antagonist can serve as a
useful chance to dump setting info on the players and clue them in to
adventure opportunities. A blood-distilling water baron who wipes out
a sand village that helped the party in an earlier adventure informs
the players not only that the water barons *exist* on the world, but
that this particular vampire warlord is on his way to seize the
hydroforming station.

At this stage, pick one Person to be the connection between the
Problem and getting the PCs directly involved. Give them a name and a
sentence or so describing how they're going to pull the PCs in, but
don't worry about fleshing them out further at this point. You might
add additional people to the mix if you know there are certain other
NPCs you want to involve in the situation, but you can delay this to
the next step.

Finally, you need to choose a Place where this adventure is going to
take place. Some sessions will occur in multiple Places, with the
heroes gallivanting around the planet or solar system to deal with the
Problem in multiple locations, but every adventure needs at least one
Place to contain the action.

Sometimes the Place itself is the focus of the action. If the PCs are
looting an alien art museum, then the museum itself is going to be the
major element of importance in the adventure. You're going to have to
make it a sufficiently interesting, complex, and engaging location to
support a full session's adventure.

Other times, the Place is just a backdrop to the action. A Problem
involving tribal warfare in the steaming xeno-jungles of some gas
giant moon might have the terrain be a factor in things, but the
jungle itself is not expected to be interesting enough to keep the
players occupied with no further action. In these situations, the
Place informs and shapes the Problem and gives color and flavor to
events, but you don't have to build it out into playable content by
itself.

For now, define the Place that contains the Problem and make sure
they're connected in some way. Even if the Place is just giving flavor
and style cues to the Problem, it should be clear to the players that
whatever is going on here is a thing that is going on in *this
particular* Place. Make the tribal warfare the kind that would occur
in a jungle, with swift canoes fashioned of giant beetle shells and
ambushes that take advantage of the perils of the alien jungle. The
more the Place affects what is happening, the more it matters to the
game.

Once you've chosen a Problem to deal with, a Person to connect the
party with the situation, and a Place where all of this is going to
unfold, you're ready to move on to the next step in creating your
adventure.


<a id="fleshing-it-out"></a>

# Fleshing It Out

You know the basic outline of the adventure, so this stage is where
you add the extra information you need to actually play it out at the
table. Some GMs need very little of this, and can improvise an
evening's play out of nothing more than an outline and a few sketched
notes. Most GMs require a little more preparation to be comfortable
with running an adventure. As you go through this process, let your
own comfort level be your guide on how detailed and elaborate your
preparation work should be, but make sure to cover the basic, critical
parts of the adventure first before you spend time detailing
contingencies and what-ifs.

To start the process, ask yourself the following questions to
determine what sort of preparation work you need to do.

***What maps do I need?*** If you expect the PCs to assault a location,
you're going to need a map good enough to support that. You can pull
something close off the web, scribble in any tweaks needed for your
adventure, and use it accordingly. Maybe the abandoned missile silo
plans you've downloaded are actually being used as a hidey-hole for a
rebel leader, but all it takes is a few coats of GM paint and the
players won't know the difference.

The more carefully and intently the PCs are going to be interacting
with a site, the more you're going to need a map for it. A tense
political meeting that takes place on some orbital resort station
might not need a map at all if the focus is around the politics of it.
If you know a terrorist group is going to bomb the talks and try to
assassinate the diplomats, however, then you're going to need enough
of a map to support the PCs' inevitable attempts to foil or escape the
bloodshed.

***What places do I need to make interesting?*** This is a special case
that you'll run into when the adventure involves exploring a site. A
simple diagram of a location is all you need to run a firefight there,
but when the thrust of the adventure involves plumbing the unknown
mysteries of a site, there better be some halfway-decent mysteries
there to plumb. There should be perilous dangers, satisfying rewards,
and interesting gubbins to manipulate in the place, elements informed
by the map's nature and origins. If the PCs are exploring a Chittik
hive-station, they ought to be finding things that make sense in the
context of a man-eating alien beetle home, while an abandoned Mandate
control center should be full of the dusty relics of that lost
star-spanning human empire.

The art of creating an interesting site to explore is worth a book in
itself, but the tools later in this chapter can help give you some
ideas. Another useful source of inspiration exists in countless
old-school fantasy adventure modules; just dig through them for
interesting setpieces, reskin them as super-science, and flavor them
with the style of whatever place they're in. Never hesitate to plunder
existing content for your game. You are but one GM, and your time and
effort are finite.

***What NPCs will I need to detail?*** When you detail an NPC, you give
them a hook, a motivation, a want, and a power. The hook is simply
some visual or behavioral detail that will help them stick in the
players' memory. Reeking cigars, chrome-plated fingers, a habit of
finishing every sentence with 'you think?', or any other unique detail
can help the players remember them when a name might slide off their
recollections. These hooks also give you a hint for descriptive detail
when you're playing out an encounter with the PCs.

A motivation is simply that; what the NPC wants from life, what
immediate goal or ambition they have. Often, this is related to the
Problem; the NPC wants a particular outcome from the situation.
Sometimes this is a broader life goal, like the desire for vast
wealth, or a particular person's love, or revenge on an enemy. A want
is what they want specifically from the PCs. Usually this is something
that helps them achieve their motivation, some assistance the PCs can
give or action they can take that will further the NPC's motivation. A
power is what they can do to help or harm the PCs, whether that
consists of giving vital info, exerting their influence for or against
the PCs, or simply the threat of their physical violence against the
party. An NPC's power is why the PCs should care about their want.

Give the NPC combat statistics at this point if you think it likely
they're going to get in a fight. Remember that most people in the
galaxy are normal human beings with no unique combat prowess. Just
because an NPC is the president of a megacorp doesn't necessarily mean
he's got more than 1 hit die, especially if he's led a life otherwise
insulated from physical danger and threats to his life.

***What default outcomes will you need to establish?*** In an unstable
situation, it's assumed that events will shake out a certain way if
the PCs don't get involved, or don't try to redirect events a
particular way. Take a moment to decide what's going to happen in the
adventure if the players don't change things. How will the situation
resolve itself, and what will happen to the NPCs involved? If there's
a particular timeline to the adventure, when certain things will
happen at certain times, note it down.

If the adventure is especially time-sensitive, make sure the PCs are
given adequate warning about it.

While the party might reasonably be expected to understand that a
tribal assault on a fortified desert community isn't going to continue
forever, if the town is going to collapse in three hours then they
need to know that every minute counts. Let NPCs warn them of the
dwindling resistance, let the enemies make visible progress toward
success, and otherwise ensure that the natural warnings inherent in
the situation are properly passed on to the players. They can't
realize how serious a situation is if the GM won't tell them what
their PCs can see.

***What are the rewards to dealing with the Problem?*** You need to
figure out what exactly the PCs are supposed to be getting out of
their efforts. If they're plundering an alien treasure-house, what
exactly are they going to find there? If they save the desert
community, what kind of help or reward do they receive? Is there some
way that solving this Problem will advance a PC's personal goals?
Sometimes the reward of a situation is simply avoiding some terrible
outcome, but too many of these charity jobs or self-defense adventures
can leave the players feeling like chumps.

Determining the rewards in experience points, cash, or plunder can be
delicate, so there's a separate section in this chapter devoted to
helping you do just that. Your choice will depend largely on how
quickly you want the PCs to advance in personal power and how
plausible it is that a given situation might offer a considerable
reward.

***Lastly, how will the PCs get involved?*** You've got a Person to hook
them in, or the Problem itself is attractive to the PCs, but how
exactly are you going to connect the players to the adventure? Figure
out the details of how you're going to introduce the adventure to the
players and take note of the information, resources, and situation
they'll encounter when they step into the scenario.


<a id="polish-it-up"></a>

# Polish It Up

You're almost finished with your adventure. All you need to do now is
put yourself in your party's shoes and think about how they're likely
to experience the adventure. You know your players better than any
author could, so you know the ways they're likely to react to NPCs,
how they like to deal with problems, and what sort of things make them
sympathetic or angry. Don't worry about some platonic Ideal Adventurer
when you're doing a mental walkthrough of the adventure. Worry about
the people you know are going to be playing this.

If you've created a sandbox-style adventure with the steps above,
there won't be any written-out “path” through the adventure. You'll
have a situation, some NPCs, and the resources you need to handle the
players interacting with that situation. Maybe they'll resolve it to
their liking, and maybe they'll end the session by booking a fast ship
offplanet with a furious mob at their heels. Your only concern at this
stage is making sure the adventure is logical, approachable, and
engaging.

Is the adventure logical? If your adventure is contradicting facts
that have already been established about the world, the players are
going to want to see a good reason for it. If they break into a slum
warehouse to find it full of elite special-ops combatants, they're
going to want a very good explanation for such a seemingly-irrational
encounter. They don't have to see every explanation or understand
every dramatic deviation from reasonable expectations, but *you*
should know these reasons, and the players should be confident that
the reasons exist.

If you design an adventure by “story logic”, where the most important
thing is maintaining a genre feel and good adventure pacing, the
players are going to react in story-logical ways. When presented with
an obstacle, they're going to assume that their heroes are expected to
have a reasonable chance to overcome that obstacle. When faced with a
dangerous combat foe, they're going to assume the enemy is at least
theoretically beatable by the group, and when encountering a
seemingly-invincible challenge, they're going to look around for the
right story levers to pull to make it somewhat more vincible. This
style of running a game is perfectly valid, and it is indeed
preferable for groups that want to maintain a certain genre feel, but
it's not usually how ***Stars Without Number*** adventures get made.

The default ***Stars Without Number*** assumption is that adventures
operate on established setting logic.

If something should be somewhere, it is, whether or not the PCs can
hope to overcome it. If an ally is locked away in the bowels of a
max-security prison, the PCs might simply not have any reasonable way
to get them out unless they can change the situation through
supplemental adventures. When the PCs see a terrifyingly dangerous
foe, that foe *really is* terrifyingly dangerous, and some PCs are
almost certainly going to die if they decide to fight. The PCs have no
cosmic authorial protection, and if they put themselves in no-win
situations, they are going to lose.

With that in mind, look at your adventure and make sure it is not the
sort of challenge or situation that would only be essayed by someone
convinced that they are the first-book protagonist of a sci-fi
trilogy. Don't expect the PCs to do unreasonable things or face
ridiculous obstacles just because they're part of the adventure. A
canny player group will make a point of avoiding unjustified perils
and staying *well clear* of unbeatable difficulties. They won't bite
on your adventure if it seems a fast-track journey to an unmarked
grave.

Is the adventure approachable? This has to do with your hook and the
overall appeal of the situation. What is it about this situation
that's going to pique player interest? Knowing what you know about
your players, is this the sort of thing they're going to jump into?
Even if you're confident that the players will want to get involved,
you need to make sure they have a clear way into the situation. If
it's a roil of political intrigue, give them somebody to contact. If
it's a mysterious alien ruin, give them a map to it.

It's not your job to develop a clear route through the adventure, a
step-by-step sequence of events that can predictably lead to success.
It is, however, your job to give the PCs a way to get involved in the
situation. If you can't see an obvious “first step” to the adventure,
then it's unlikely your players will be able to see one.

Is the adventure engaging? An adventure which is about something
fundamentally uninteresting to the players is just not going to hold
their attention. Good sports will try to get through it simply because
it's what you created for them, but other players will start playing
with their phones, talking about extraneous matters, or just doing
something else in-game. Even if the PCs have a logical reason to care
about the adventure, if the *players* are not invested, they aren't
going to have a very good time.

To build engagement, use elements your players love and elements your
players hate. What do your players really like? What kind of NPCs,
situations, and activities do they really enjoy? Don't worry about
abstract players, just think about the specific people you are playing
with. Conversely, what kind of villains do they absolutely despise?
What sort of evildoing gets them fired up with righteous wrath? It's
important not to push things into gratuitous grimdark, but if you have
some players who really hate slavers, then that's a good cue to make
beating down slavers an element in an adventure.

Once you've polished up the adventure, done a mental walk-through of
events, and ensured that it is logical, approachable, and engaging,
then you're ready to play.

# Creating Filler Adventures

Sometimes a GM gets caught flat-footed by the players. They do
something or choose a goal that the GM is totally unprepared to
manage. A GM is well within their rights to call a pause and explain
to the players that they're just not ready to handle that yet, and if
the players want to do it, they can do it next session, after the GM
has had time to prep something for it.

Other times, however, the GM will just throw in a quick *filler
adventure*. These are adventures built expressly for running when the
GM is caught by surprise or runs out of prepared content for the
evening. Filler adventures are built much like any other adventure,
but their priorities are different. Filler adventures should be
insistent, short, and simple.

The adventure needs to be insistent; it needs to present a situation
that the PCs absolutely must deal with right this minute. A terrorist
attack, a criminal stealing a PC macguffin, a friend frantically
calling for help&#x2026; the adventure needs to grab the PCs and distract
them from whatever it was they were trying to do.

Even so, the adventure should be short. A filler adventure shouldn't
take longer to complete than it takes for you to come up with a good
response to the players' initial goal. You just need to keep the
players entertained long enough for you to figure out what you're
going to do, so a filler adventure shouldn't eat up more than a
session at most.

Lastly, the adventure should be simple. Don't burn yourself out on
complex entanglements and relations to the existing adventure. If you
can come up with a good tie-in quickly, great, but the ideal filler
adventure is general enough to slot in almost anywhere.

Unused bits and pieces of your regular adventures can be used as
filler components. Don't waste your work; if the PCs haven't seen it,
save it for later use.


<a id="adventure-rewards"></a>

# Adventure Rewards

Player characters all have their own reasons for seeking adventure in
the trackless void, but pragmatic rewards of wealth, power, and
influence tend to be popular. When designing your adventures, how
should you apportion rewards, whether in experience points, pretech
artifacts, or credits?


<a id="rewarding-credits"></a>

# Rewarding Credits

The first thing to understand about the credit economy in your
campaign is that “too much money” is not a significant problem to
have. Unlike many types of games, there's really nothing the PCs can
do with large amounts of money that will allow them to drastically
improve their own personal power. They can hire minions, they can buy
starships, they can get cyberware, and they can use their wealth as a
bludgeon of influence, but at the end of the day they still basically
have the same character sheet as before.

In the same vein, in a sandbox campaign there is no storyline to
disrupt. If the PCs suddenly luck into a stellar tyrant's ransom, then
the campaign is about what they do with the money. Maybe it lets them
casually crush the problems they used to have, but now they've got an
entirely new set of concerns befitting their newfound wealth. Unless
the PCs simply decide to stop adventuring after a lucky strike, their
future campaign sessions will simply be flavored with great wealth and
the problems and possibilities that come along with it.

So don't worry about “keeping the PCs hungry”. Just let them acquire
the logical amount of money that their deeds and situation would earn
them. If they do a significant favor for a megacorp CEO, they should
be earning a lot more than they'd get from the heartfelt gratitude of
a lostworlder peasant whose life they saved.

With that in mind, here's an adjacent list of reasonable credit
amounts that can be applied to adventures. If the PCs do work for
someone, they'll get paid to the extent that they earned it and the
patron can afford it. If they come across lost loot or valuable cargo,
you can use these numbers to gauge what a “big haul” would be to most
people in the setting.


<a id="rewarding-ships-and-major-items"></a>

# Rewarding Ships and Major Items

Most groups are going to want to get their own starship relatively
early on in the campaign. You might even have the acquisition of a
beaten-up merchant ship be the result of the introductory
adventure. While it's certainly possible for a scifi campaign to spend
most of its time on a single world or for PCs to hitch rides with
allies and existing transport ships, most players are going to want to
get their own set of thrusters.

The basic guideline for rewarding a ship or any other major piece of
hardware is that it's going to take at least one session of adventure
to get it, assuming you think it's reasonable to allow it in the first
place. The PCs are going to have to come up with a plan or look for an
opportunity to grab the thing they want if they don't have the money
to buy it outright.

You can use this principle when the PCs want anything, whether it's a
ship, a particular ally, a base of operations, or anything else that
can't reasonably buy. Make them adventure for it. You can give them
suggestions and ideas, but it's up to them to come up with a plan for
getting their hands on what they want.

Once they've done that, all you need to do is make up an adventure
revolving around their efforts, and you've got your evening's
entertainment. As always, you should be watchful for opportunities to
make PC ambitions into easy adventure outlines.

# Rewarding Experience Points

There are several different methods to award experience points. The
one you choose will depend largely on the kind of campaign you want to
run and the speed of advancement you want for the PCs.

The basic experience award for each member of a party is three points.
This assumes a fairly fast rate of advancement, with PCs reaching
second level after their first award. If you want a slower one, drop
it to two points, or even one. All members of the group should get the
same basic award unless you want PCs of different levels in your
group.

When do you hand out this basic award? You have several different
choices.

***Use a session-based system.*** Hand out the award at the end of every
gaming session, assuming the PCs were trying to accomplish something
worthy of their skills. Parties that coast along without facing any
real challenges might not receive the award.

***Use a personal goal-based system.*** Have every PC list at least one
long-term goal and one short-term goal. If they achieve a short-term
goal during the session, give them a basic award. If they manage to
succeed at a long-term goal, give them triple that amount of
experience. Different characters can share the same goals if they
wish, and it's up to the GM to decide whether or not a particular goal
is challenging enough to deserve a reward. PCs can pick new goals or
change old ones at the end of each session.

Note that if you use this method different PCs will advance at
different rates, depending on how often they reach their goals. This
isn't a problem if the group is fine with it, and if PCs work to make
sure the party isn't focusing too much on the goals of only a few
members. If you want to help encourage spreading the focus around, you
can rule that no PC can get goal XP again until someone else in the
group has achieved a goal.

***Use a mission-based system.*** Have the group agree on a mission or
goal at the end of each session or at the start of the campaign. When
the group reaches that goal, they all get an experience award. They
can choose to change their goal at the end of every session, or pick a
new one if they've attained their original purpose. If they choose a
particularly hard mission they might get an extra bonus, at the cost
of a greater risk of failure.

***Use a loot-based system.*** This sort of campaign doesn't use
experience points. Instead, it uses cash. Every PC needs to earn 5,000
credits of liquid funds in rewards or loot before reaching second
level. Then they need to earn 10,000 more to reach third, 20,000 more
to reach fourth, and so on, with the new amount needed doubling at
each level. Only wealth they've earned adventuring and converted into
spendable credits counts toward this amount.

Once a PC gains a level, their running “score” is reset to zero, and
even huge hauls can't boost them more than one level at a time.

This experience method strongly incentivizes ruthless plundering, and
might result in uneven advancement if the party doesn't split their
earnings evenly. It does make for a laser-focused game of freebooting
avarice, however.

***Use a spending-based system.*** This works the same way as the
loot-based system, but the credits they earn only count if the PC
*spends* them. Credits spent on personal equipment, cyberware,
vehicles, or other directly useful items don't count. Only credits
“wasted” in revelry, charity, supporting some NPC cause, building a
power base, or otherwise interacting with the game world count toward
the PC's advancement.

This, too, can result in a party with PCs of varying character level
over time, as some choose to buy hardware and others elect to “waste”
the money. It does encourage a great deal of engagement, however.

# Creating Problems

Every Problem boils down to a fundamental conflict. A person wants
something and they can't have it, or they don't want something and are
being forced to accept it, or they have something and it's being
threatened, or they want something and someone else wants it too. At
the bottom of every Problem there's a conflict the PCs can engage.
These tables on the following pages provide some cues for generating
Problems for your adventures.

First, roll 1d8, 1d10, and 1d10 on the Conflict Type table. The first
roll gives you an idea of the general type of conflict at the bottom
of the adventure. It might be a matter of money, old grudges, a
natural catastrophe, ethnic struggles, or one of several other root
causes. You can stop at this point if the cue is sufficiently
inspirational.

Otherwise, the next roll gives you the overall situation of the
conflict. This is the backdrop to the adventure, and while the PCs may
not be able to resolve the entire conflict, they should be able to
make a difference in this particular skirmish. You can take this
general context and decide on a specific event or situation that's
causing the conflict at the heart of the Problem.

If further inspiration is needed, the third roll gives you a specific
focus for the Problem. Something is happening, and there are at least
two sides involved; one that is in favor of what is happening, and one
that is opposed. Just put forces on both sides of the focus and you'll
have your starting Problem.

Some Problems have the PCs on one of the sides. If “Money was stolen
from someone” and “The PCs are owed it”, then the PCs themselves will
have a powerful incentive to involve themselves in the conflict. Other
Problems only have people on one side; if there's a catastrophic
natural disaster, the disaster itself is unlikely to have motivations
or goals, while the hapless victims doubtless are struggling to
survive.

To add further decoration to the circumstances, you can roll on the
tables below. The Restraint table gives you a reason why the conflict
hasn't boiled over yet, and why the PCs might be a wildcard that can
resolve the problem at hand. Some Problems can keep a long time with a
sufficiently stern Restraint, which makes them convenient when you
need to make filler adventures that can stay in storage until you need
them.

The Twist table gives you a turn you can add to the Problem, something
to complicate the situation and shake up easy assumptions about how it
will play out.

At all times, you should be looking for chances to insert elements
you've already created for this world. Use Enemies for antagonists,
Friends for allies, and slip in Complications when you need additional
twists. GMing is tough enough without making extra work.

# Creating People

You'll need People to help the PCs get involved in your adventure and
to flesh out the personalities and important figures in the Problem.
Not every NPC needs to be worked up fully, but it can be convenient to
have a few spare People around to drop in when the players suddenly
take an interest in a bit-player NPC you never expected they'd focus
on.

To generate a Person, start with their motivation. This is what the
Person wants out of life, their major focus and drive. The deals they
offer and the actions they take should revolve around this motivation.
Different people will go to different extremes to follow this
motivation, so you shouldn't feel obligated to make it a monomania for
them, but it's the basic driver of their actions.

Next, pick a want. This is the immediate thing the NPC thinks will
most effectively advance their motivation. If the latter is “Promote a
friend or offspring's career” and the want is “Burn down or destroy a
particular structure”, then you simply have to figure out how burning
down that place is going to advance the NPC's daughter's career. The
want is what the NPC is most likely to desire the PCs to help them
achieve.

Now determine their power. This is what the NPC can use to pay off the
PCs or threaten them into compliance. If a Person hasn't got any power
to help or harm the party, the PCs aren't going to have
much motivation to care about their wants. Not every NPC will have
*much* power, but they should all be able to do something to help or
hinder the PCs.

Then you determine a hook, a visual or character quirk that will help
you describe them during play and help the players remember who they
are.

Lastly, if you want to make life a little easier for yourself, you can
roll or pick an initial manner of approach and a default deal outcome
for the Person. These additional tables help smooth out the handling
of PC deals and negotiations with the NPC.

The initial manner is simply how the NPC will deal with the PCs during
their initial meeting. Maybe they'll be effusively appreciative of the
party's capabilities, or maybe they'll be full of thin-lipped
disapproval, but their manner can give you some cues for playing out
the NPC's interactions with the party.

The default deal outcome can give you a cue as to how or if the NPC
will keep any deal they make with the PCs. In some cases, you'll
already know whether or not the NPC will play fair with the party,
either because you know they're essentially trustworthy people or you
know they're double-dipped bastards. The table is convenient when
you're not quite sure if an NPC is as good as their word.

# Creating Places

Places can be very simple to create or very complex. If a Place is
only needed as a backdrop for events and you don't expect the PCs to
spend much time exploring it, you really don't need anything more than
a name and a few sentences of description for the table. If it's to be
an alien ruin, enemy base, or some other structure that the PCs are
going to carefully interact with, you'll need something more
interesting.

For the former type of place, just pull an appropriate Place from the
world generation data you've already created. You can then give it
some background activity from the table below. If it's an urban,
civilized sort of location, you can roll for a Civilized Ongoing to
indicate what's happening there right now. If it's a lost ruin,
wilderness glade, or other wild place, roll or pick from the
Wilderness Ongoings list.

If the PCs plan to investigate the place, you'll want a Reward to
determine what worthwhile thing the PCs might find there. In some
cases, you'll already know what the Reward should be; if the PCs are
going into an alien ruin to dig out a lost macguffin, then the
macguffin itself will be the reward. You can still use the Reward
table to create some secondary loot prospects in the place if you
wish, the better to reward careful exploration and creative overcoming
of the area's inevitable hazards.

Those hazards can be derived from the opposite table. The first roll
gives a general type of hazard that the PCs will have to face in an
area or sub-area of the Place, while the specific examples and
possible dangers provide more concrete suggestions.

You can apply these hazards to specific parts of the Place, or if the
area is too small to sustain much mayhem, you might roll once and
apply it generally to the entire location.

One of the easiest ways to quickly produce an interesting area to
explore is to go online and loot the web for old-school-style fantasy
adventure modules. In many cases, the maps and floor plans can be
stolen outright, while the room contents can be reskinned with
suitably sci-fi flavor. Most of these old adventures use game
mechanics that are similar to those used by ***Stars Without Number***,
such as hit points, Armor Classes, damage rolls, and gold piece values
that can easily be converted to credits. If you mix and match these
components, using pieces from multiple adventures to stitch together
what you need, even those players who might have experienced the
original adventure won't be able to recognize your handiwork.

This principle of constructive looting is important to any sandbox GM.
Save creative energy for where it counts. Everywhere else, plunder
without shame.

# ADVENTURE SEEDS

The hundred ideas that follow are basic outlines for various
adventures. Just take the components you've rolled for a given planet,
slot them in the spaces noted in the adventure seeds, and build out
from there to create an evening's entertainment.

If you want something more complicated than these basic seeds provide,
you can string several of them together, gluing them into a single
perilous circumstance to occupy the heroes.

As a general rule
of thumb, a single seed should occupy the group for a single session's
worth of adventure. If you need to create more content than that, you
can scale events by adding additional complications or breaking the
adventure up into several additional tasks or obstacles that must be
overcome before the PCs can successfully resolve it.

1.  An Enemy seeks to rob a Friend of some precious Thing that he has
    desired for some time.

2.  A Thing has been discovered on property owned by a Friend, but a
    Complication risks its destruction.

3.  A Complication suddenly hits the party while they're out doing some
    innocuous activity.

4.  The players unwittingly offend or injure an Enemy, incurring his or
    her wrath. A Friend offers help in escaping the consequences.

Rumor speaks of the discovery of a precious Thing in a distant Place.
The players must get to it before an Enemy does.

An Enemy has connections with offworld pirates or slavers, and a
Friend has been captured by them.

A Place has been seized by violent revolutionaries or rebels, and a
Friend is being held hostage by them.

A Friend is in love with someone forbidden by social convention, and
the two of them need help eloping.

An Enemy wields tyrannical power over a
Friend, relying on the bribery of corrupt local officials to escape
consequences.

A Friend has been lost in hostile wilderness, and the party must reach
a Place to rescue them in the teeth of a dangerous Complication.

An Enemy has committed a grave offense against a PC or their family
sometime in the past. A Friend shows the party a weakness in the
Enemy's defenses.

The party is suddenly caught in a conflict
between two warring families or political parties. The party is framed
for a crime by an Enemy, and must reach the sanctuary of a Place
before they can regroup and find the Thing that will prove their
innocence and their Enemy's perfidy.

A Friend is threatened by a tragedy of sickness, legal calamity, or
public humiliation, and the only one that seems able to save them is
an Enemy.

1.  A natural disaster or similar Complication strikes a Place while the
    party is present, causing great loss of life and property unless the
    party is able to immediately respond to the injured and trapped.

2.

A Friend with a
  young business has struck a cache of pretech, valuable minerals, or
  precious salvage. He needs the party to help him reach the Place
  where the valuables are. An oppressed segment of society starts a
  sudden revolt in the Place the party is occupying. An Enemy simply
  lumps the party in with the rebels and tries to put the revolt down
  with force. A Friend offers them a way to either help the rebels or
  clear their names.

A vulnerable Friend has been targeted for abduction, and has need of
guards. A sudden Complication makes guarding them from the Enemy
seeking their kidnapping much more difficult. If the Friend is
snatched, they must rescue them from a Place.

A mysterious Place offers the promise of some precious Thing, but
access is very dangerous due to wildlife, hostile locals, or a
dangerous environment.

An Enemy and a Friend both have legal claim on a Thing, and seek to
undermine each other's case. The Enemy is willing to do murder if he
thinks he can get away with it.

1.  An Enemy seeks the death of his brother, a Friend, by arranging the
    failure of his grav flyer or shuttlecraft in dangerous terrain while
    the party is coincidentally aboard. The party must survive the
    environment and bring proof of the crime out with them.

2.  A Friend seeks to slip word to a lover, one who is also being
    courted by the Friend's brother, who is an Enemy. A Complication
    threatens to cause death or disgrace to the lover unless they either
    accept the Enemy's suit or are helped by the party.

3.  An Enemy is convinced that one of the party has committed adultery
    with their flirtatious spouse. He means to lure them to a Place,
    trap them, and have them killed by the dangers there.

4.

An Enemy has
  been driven insane by exotic recreational drugs or excessive psionic
  torching. He fixes on a PC as being his mortal nemesis, and plots
  elaborate deaths, attempting to conceal his involvement amid
  Complications. A Friend has stolen a precious Thing from an Enemy
  and fled into a dangerous, inaccessible Place. The party must rescue
  them, and decide what to do with the Thing and the outraged Enemy.

An Enemy has realized that their brother or sister has engaged in a
socially unacceptable affair with a Friend, and means to kill both of
them unless stopped by the party.

1.

A Friend has
  accidentally caused the death of a family member, and wants the
  party to help him hide the body or fake an accidental death before
  his family realizes what has happened. A Complication suddenly makes
  the task more difficult.

1.  A Friend is a follower of a zealous ideologue who plans to make a
    violent demonstration of the righteousness of his cause, causing a
    social Complication. The Friend will surely be killed in the
    aftermath if not rescued or protected by the party.

A Friend's sibling is to be placed in a dangerous situation they've
got no chance of surviving. The Friend takes their place at the last
moment, and will almost certainly die unless the party aids them.

Suicide bombers detonate an explosive, chemical, or biological weapon
in a Place occupied by the party where a precious Thing is stored The
PCs must escape before the Place collapses on top of them, navigating
throngs of terrified people in the process and saving the Thing if
possible.

An Enemy who controls landing permits, oxygen rations, or some other
important resource has a prejudice against one or more of the party
members. He demands that they bring him a Thing from a dangerous Place
before he'll give them the goods.

1.  A Friend in a loveless marriage to an Enemy seeks escape to be with
    their beloved, and contacts the party to snatch them from their
    spouse's guards at a prearranged Place.

2.

A Friend seeks
  to elope with their lover, and contacts the party to help them meet
  their paramour at a remote, dangerous Place. On arrival, they find
  that the lover is secretly an Enemy desirous of their removal and
  merely lured them to the place to meet their doom.

The party receives or finds a Thing which proves the crimes of an
Enemy- yet a Friend was complicit in the crimes, and will be punished
as well if the authorities are involved. And the Enemy will stop at
nothing to get the item back.

A Friend needs to get to a Place on time in order to complete a
business contract, but an Enemy means to delay and hinder them until
it's too late, inducing Complications to the trip.

A locked pretech stasis pod has been discovered by a Friend, along
with directions to the hidden keycode that will open it. The Place
where the keycode is hidden is now owned by an Enemy.

A fierce schism has broken out in the local majority religion, and an
Enemy is making a play to take control of the local hierarchy. A
Friend is on the side that will lose badly if the Enemy succeeds, and
needs a Thing to prove the other group's error.

1.  A former Enemy has been given reason to repent his treatment of a
    Friend, and secretly commissions them to help the Friend overcome a
    Complication. A different Enemy discovers the connection, and tries
    to paint the PCs as double agents.

2.  An alien or a human with extremely peculiar spiritual beliefs seeks
    to visit a Place for their own reasons. An Enemy of their own kind
    attempts to stop them before they can reach the Place, and reveal
    the Thing that was hidden there long ago.

3.

A Friend's
  sibling is an untrained psychic, and has been secretly using his or
  her powers to protect the Friend from an Enemy. The neural damage
  has finally overwhelmed their sanity, and they've now kidnapped the
  Friend to keep them safe. The Enemy is taking this opportunity to
  make sure the Friend “dies at the hands of their maddened sibling”.
  A Friend who is a skilled precognitive has just received a flash of
  an impending atrocity to be committed by an Enemy. He or she needs
  the party to help them steal the Thing that will prove the Enemy's
  plans while dodging the assassins sent to eliminate the precog.

1.  A Friend who is an exotic dancer is sought by an Enemy who won't
    take no for an answer. The dancer is secretly a Perimeter agent
    attempting to infiltrate a Place to destroy maltech research, and
    plots to use the party to help get him or her into the facility
    under the pretext of striking at the Enemy.

2.  A young woman on an interplanetary tour needs the hire of local
    bodyguards. She turns out to be a trained and powerful combat
    psychic, but touchingly naive about local dangers, causing a social
    Complication that threatens to get the whole group arrested.

3.

A librarian
  Friend has discovered an antique databank with the coordinates of a
  long-lost pretech cache hidden in a Place sacred to a long-vanished
  religion. The librarian is totally unsuited for danger, but
  necessary to decipher the obscure religious iconography needed to
  unlock the cache. The cache is not the anticipated Thing, but
  something more dangerous to the finder.

1.  A fragment of orbital debris clips a shuttle on the way in, and the
    spaceport is seriously damaged in the crash. The player's ship or
    the

only vessel capable of getting them off-planet will be destroyed
unless the players can organize a response to the dangerous chemical
fires and radioactives contaminating the port. A Friend is trapped
somewhere in the control tower wreckage.

1.  A Friend is allied with a reformist religious group that seeks to
    break the grip of the current, oppressive hierarchy. The current
    hierarchs have a great deal of political support with the
    authorities, but the commoners resent them bitterly. The Friend
    seeks to secure a remote Place as a meeting-place for the
    theological rebels.

2.

A microscopic
  black hole punctures an orbital station or starship above the world.
  Its interaction with the station's artificial grav generators has
  thrown everything out of whack, and the station's become a minefield
  of dangerously high or zero grav zones. It's tearing itself apart,
  and it's going to collapse soon. An Enemy seeks to escape aboard the
  last lifeboat and to Hell with everyone else. Meanwhile, a Friend is
  trying to save his engineer daughter from the radioactive,
  grav-unstable engine rooms.

1.  The planet has a sealed alien ruin, and an Enemy-led cult who
    worships the vanished builders. They're convinced that they have the
    secret to opening and controlling the power inside the ruins, but
    they're only halfright. A Friend has found evidence that shows that
    they'll only devastate the planet if they meddle with the alien
    power planet. The party has to get inside the ruins and shut down
    the engines before it's too late. Little do they realize that a few
    aliens survive inside, in a stasis field that will be broken by the
    ruin's opening.

2.  An Enemy and the group are suddenly trapped in a Place during an accident or Complication. They must

work together to escape in time.

1.

A telepathic
  Friend has discovered that an Enemy was responsible for a recent
  atrocity. Telepathic evidence is useless on this world, however, and
  if she's discovered to have scanned his mind she'll be lobotomized
  as a 'rogue psychic'. A Thing might be enough to prove his guilt, if
  the party can figure out how to get to it without revealing their
  Friend's meddling.

A Friend is responsible for safeguarding a Thing- yet the Thing is
suddenly proven to be a fake. The party must find the real object and
the Enemy who stole it or else their Friend will be punished as the
thief.

A Friend is bitten by a poisonous local animal while in a remote
Place. The only antidote is back at civilization, yet a Complication
threatens to delay the group until it is too late.

1.

A lethal plague
  has started among the residents of the town, but a Complication is
  keeping aid from reaching them. An Enemy is taking advantage of the
  panic to hawk a fake cure at ruinous prices, and a Friend is taken
  in by him. The Complication must be overcome before help can reach
  the town.

1.  A radical political party has started to institute pogroms against
    “groups hostile to the people”. A Friend is among those groups, and
    needs to get out of town before an Enemy uses the riot as cover to
    settle old scores.

2.  An Enemy has sold the party an expensive but worthlessly flawed
    piece of equipment before lighting out for the back country. He and
    his plunder are holed up at a remote Place.

3.  A concert of offworld music is being held in town, and a Friend is
    slated to be the star performer. Reactionary elements led by an
    Enemy plot to ruin the “corrupting noise” with sabotage that risks
    getting performers killed. Meanwhile, a crowd of ignorant offworlder
    fans have landed and are infuriating the locals.

4.  An Enemy is wanted on a neighboring world for some heinous act, and
    a Friend turns up as a bounty hunter ready to bring him in alive.
    This world refuses to extradite him, so the capture and retrieval
    has to evade local law enforcement.

An unanticipated solar storm blocks communications and grounds the
poorly-shielded grav vehicle that brought the group to this remote
Place. Then people start turning up dead; the storm has awoken a
dangerous Enemy beast.

1.

A Friend has
  discovered a partially-complete schematic for an ancient pretech
  refinery unit that produces vast amounts of something precious on
  this world- water, oxygen, edible compounds, or the like. Several
  remote Places on the planet are indicated as having the necessary
  pretech spare parts required to build the device. When finally
  assembled, embedded self-modification software in the Thing modifies
  itself into a pretech combat bot. The salvage from it remains very
  valuable.

1.  A Complication ensnares the party where they are in an annoying but
    seemingly ordinary event. In actuality, an Enemy is using it as
    cover to strike at a Friend or Thing that happens to be where the
    PCs are.

2.  A Friend has a cranky, temperamental artificial heart installed, and
    the doctor who put it in is the only one who really understands how
    it works. The heart has recently started to stutter, but the doctor
    has vanished. An Enemy has snatched him to fit his elite assassins
    with very unsafe combat mods.

A local clinic is doing wonders in providing free health care to the
poor. In truth, it's a front for an offworld eugenics cult, with
useful “specimens” kidnapped and shipped offworld while 'cremated
remains' are given to the family. A Friend is snatched by them, but
the party knows they'd have never consented to cremation as the clinic
staff claim.

1.  Space pirates have cut a deal with an isolated backwoods settlement,
    off loading their plunder to merchants who meet them there. A Friend
    goes home to family after a long absence, but is kidnapped or killed
    before they can bring back word of the dealings. Meanwhile, the
    party is entrusted with a valuable Thing that must be brought to the
    Friend quickly.

2.

A reclusive
  psychiatrist is offering treatment for violent mentally ill patients
  at a remote Place. His treatments seem to work, calming the subjects
  and returning them to rationality, though major memory loss is
  involved and some severe social clumsiness ensues. In actuality,
  he's removed large portions of their brains to fit them with
  remote-control units slaved to an AI in his laboratory. He intends
  to use them as drones to acquire more “subjects”, and eventual
  control of the town.

1.  Vital medical supplies against an impending plague have been shipped
    in from offworld,

but the spike drive craft that was due to deliver them misjumped, and
has arrived in-system as a lifeless wreck transmitting a blind
distress signal. Whoever gets there first can hold the whole planet
hostage, and an Enemy means to do just that.

1.  A Friend has spent a substantial portion of their wealth on an
    ultra-modern new domicile, and invites the party to enjoy a weekend
    there. An Enemy has hacked the house's computer system to trap the
    inhabitants inside and use the automated fittings to kill them.

2.

A mud slide,
  hurricane, earthquake, or other form of disaster strikes a remote
  settlement. The party is the closest group of responders, and must
  rescue the locals while dealing with the unearthed, malfunctioning
  pretech Thing that threatens to cause an even greater calamity if
  not safely defused.

1.  A Friend has found a lost pretech installation, and needs help to
    loot it. By planetary law, the contents belong to the government.

An Enemy mistakes the party for the kind of offworlders who will
murder innocents for pay- assuming they aren't that kind, at least.
He's sloppy with the contact and unwittingly identifies himself,
letting the players know that a Friend will shortly die unless the
Enemy is stopped.

A party member is identified as a prophesied savior for an oppressed
faith or ethnicity. The believers obstinately refuse to believe any
protestations to the contrary, and a cynical Enemy in government
decides the PC must die simply to prevent the risk of uprising. An
equally cynical Friend is determined to push the PC forward as a
savior, because that's what's needed.

Alien beasts
escape from a zoo and run wild through the spectators. The panicked
owner offers large rewards for recapturing them live, but some of the
beasts are quite dangerous. A trained psychic is accused of going
feral by an Enemy. The psychic had already suffered severe neural
damage before being found for training, so brain scans cannot
establish physical signs of madness. The psychic seems unstable, but
not violent- at least, on short acquaintance. The psychic offers a
psychic PC the secrets of a unique psychic technique if they help him
flee.

A Thing is the token of rulership on this world, and it's gone
missing. If it's not found rapidly, the existing ruler will be
deposed. Evidence left at a Place suggests that an Enemy has it, but
extralegal means are necessary to investigate fully.

Psychics are vanishing, including a Friend. They're being kidnapped by
an ostensibly-rogue government researcher who is using them to
research the lost psychic disciplines that helped enable pretech
manufacturing, and they are being held at a remote Place. The snatcher
is a small-time local Enemy with unnaturally ample resources.

1.  A Friend desperately seeks to hide evidence of some past crime that
    will ruin his life should it come to light. An Enemy holds the Thing
    that proves his involvement, and blackmails him ruthlessly.

2.

A courier
  mistakes the party for the wrong set of offworlders, and wordlessly
  deposits a Thing with them that implies something awful- med-frozen,
  child-sized human organs, for example, or a private catalog of
  gengineered human slaves. The courier's boss shortly realizes the
  error, and this Enemy tries to silence the PCs while preserving the
  Place where his evil is enacted.

1.  A slowboat system freighter is taken over by Enemy separatist
    terrorists at the same time as the planet's space defenses are taken
    offline by internal terrorist attacks. The freighter is aimed
    straight at the starport, and will crash into it in hours if not
    stopped.

Alien artifacts on the planet's surface start beaming signals into the
system's asteroid belt. The signals provoke a social Complication in
panicked response, and an Enemy seeks to use the confusion to take
over. The actual effect of the signals might be harmless, or might
summon a long-lost alien AI warship to scourge life from the world.

1.  An alien ambassador Friend is targeted by xenophobe Enemy assassins.
    Relations are so fragile that if the ambassador even realizes that
    humans are making a serious effort to kill him, the result may be
    war.

2.

A new religion
  is being preached by a Friend on this planet. Existing faiths are
  not amused, and an Enemy among the hierarchy is provoking the people
  to persecute the new believers, hoping for things to get out of
  hand.

An Enemy was once the patron of a Friend until the latter was
betrayed. Now the Friend wants revenge, and they think they have the
information necessary to get past the Enemy's defenses.

Vital life support or medical equipment has been sabotaged by
offworlders or zealots, and must be repaired before time runs out. The
only possible source of parts is at a Place, and the saboteurs can be
expected to be working hard to get there and destroy them, too.

A Friend is importing offworld tech that threatens to completely
replace the offerings of an Enemy businessman. The Enemy seeks to
sabotage the friend's stock, and thus 'prove' its inferiority.

An Exchange diplomat is negotiating for the opening of a branch of the
interstellar bank on this world. An Enemy among the local banks wants
to show the world as being ungovernably unstable, so provokes
Complications and riots around the diplomat.

1.  An Enemy is infuriated by the uppity presumption of an ambitious
    Friend of a lower social caste, and tries to pin a local
    Complication on the results of his unnatural rejection of his proper
    place.

2.

A Friend is
  working for an offworld corporation to open a manufactory, and is
  ignoring local traditions that privilege certain social or ethnic
  groups, giving jobs to the most qualified workers instead. An angry
  Enemy seeks to sabotage the factory.

1.  An offworld musician who was revered as little less than a god on
    his homeworld requires bodyguards. He immediately acquires Enemies
    on this world with his riotous ways, and his guards must keep him
    from getting arrested if they are to be paid.

Atmospheric disturbances, dust storms, or other particulate clouds
suddenly blow into town, leaving the settlement blind. An Enemy
commits a murder during the darkness, and attempts to frame the
players as convenient scapegoats.

An Enemy spikes the oxygen supply of an orbital station or
unbreathable-atmosphere hab dome with hallucinogens as cover for a
theft. Most victims are merely confused and disoriented, but some
become violent in their delusions. By chance, the party's air supply
was not contaminated.

1.

By coincidence,
  one of the party members is wearing clothing indicative of
  membership in a violent political group, and thus the party is
  treated in friendly fashion by a local Enemy for no obvious reason.
  The Enemy assumes that the party will go along with some vicious
  crime without complaint, and the group isn't informed of what's in
  the offing until they're in deep.

1.  A local ruler wishes outworlders to advise him of the quality of his
    execrable poetry- and is the sort to react very poorly to anything
    less that evidently sincere and fulsome praise. Failure to amuse the
    ruler results in the party being dumped in a dangerous Place to
    “experience truly poetic solitude”.

2.  A Friend among the locals is unreasonably convinced that offworlder
    tech can repair anything, and has blithely promised a powerful local
    Enemy that the party can easily fix a damaged pretech Thing. The
    Enemy has invested in many expensive spare parts, but the

truly necessary pieces are kept in a still-dangerous pretech
installation in a remote Place.

1.

The party's
  offworld comm gear picks up a chance transmission from the local
  government and automatically descrambles the primitive encryption
  key. The document is proof that an Enemy in government intends to
  commit an atrocity against a local village with a group of
  “deniable” renegades in order to steal a Thing kept in the village.

1.  A Friend belongs to a persecuted faith, ethnicity, or social class,
    and appeals for the PCs to help a cell of rebels get offworld before
    the Enemy law enforcement finds them.

2.  A part on the party's ship or the only other transport out has
    failed, and needs immediate replacement. The only available part is
    held by an Enemy, who will only willingly relinquish it in exchange
    for a Thing held by an innocent Friend who will refuse to sell at
    any price.

Eugenics cultists are making gengineered slaves out of genetic
material gathered at a local brothel. Some of the unnaturally tempting
slaves are being slipped among the prostitutes as bait to infatuate
powerful officials, while others are being sold under the table to
less scrupulous elites.

Evidence has been unearthed at a Place that substantial portions of
the planet are actually owned by members of an oppressed and
persecuted group. The local courts have no intention of recognizing
the rights, but the codes with the ownership evidence would allow
someone to bypass a number of antique pretech defenses around the
planetary governor's palace. A Friend wants the codes to pass to his
friends among the group's rebels.

1.

A crop smut
   threatens the planet's agriculture, promising large-scale famine. A
   Friend finds evidence that a secret government research station in
   the system's asteroid belt was conducting experiments in
   disease-resistant crop strains for the planet before the Silence

# AN EXAMPLE OF ADVENTURE CREATION

The GM has just started a new campaign, and he needs to brew up an initial adventure to pull the party together and get them accustomed to the sector he's just created. He knows what planet the PCs are going to begin on and he knows he wants them to end up owning a battered free merchant starship by the end of the session, but the rest is still up in the air.

He starts by deciding whether or not to use an adventure seed. While
he sees a few that might work, he decides instead to roll up this
adventure from scratch.

The world he's created is a planet known to its natives as Delaine,
with the world tags “Alien Ruins” and “Xenophobes”. The Delainers have
numerous unexplored alien ruins on their world, but fear them as
potential sources of catastrophe. They hate outsiders because the
offworlders are constantly prodding at the ruins and trying to loot
them, and care nothing for the disasters they might unleash on the
locals.

The GM knows that his first batch of PCs are very unlikely to all be
Delainers, so he decides that they were all passengers on a smuggler
ship that tried to land on Delaine and loot one of the ruins. The
Delainer defense grid spotted the ship and knocked it down, however,
and the PCs were among the few survivors. Maybe the PCs were initially
part of the smuggler crew, or maybe they were just oblivious
passengers. The GM will let each player decide what their PC's role
was during character creation.

The first step is to pick a Problem for the PCs to get involved in. On
the face of it, the obvious Problem for the PCs is that they're
marooned on a hostile world and need to get off before the natives
find them and either kill or imprison them.

The GM wants
something a little more specific than this, however. He rolls some
dice on the Conflict table, and comes up with “Ethnicity” for the
Conflict, with “Two groups that hate each other” and “Official ethnic
ghettos”. Given Delaine's history, the GM decides that any non-native
Delainers present when the world shut down its contact with other
planets were separated out into remote ethnic reservations, far away
from the ruins. These “offworlders” have been here for generations but
are despised by the native Delainers.

With that established, the GM decides that the PC's ship was shot down
near one of these reservations, and the bitter offworlders are
interested in helping people whom the Delainers hate. But who will the
initial Person the PCs contact be?

The dice paint the
picture of an offworlder motivated to redeem themselves from a prior
failure, who wants to find proof of a rival NPC's malfeasance, who
knows where significant wealth is to be found, and wears a
particularly odd style of dress. From this, the GM creates “the
Captain”, a former ruin smuggler whose crew was gunned down while
trying to loot an alien ruin. Only he survived, and his guilt is
intense. He still wears a nautical captain's hat, and is hiding out
among the offworlders. He knows where he's hidden his ship and can
guide the PCs to it if they can make the dangerous overland journey.

The GM isn't so certain about the Captain's want, however. While
something like that would make a good sideline for a longer adventure,
he wants this initial adventuring session to be relatively short and
straightforward. He replaces the want with the Captain's desire for
the PCs to get him and his young offworlder wife off the planet,
bringing them to just about any place that isn't on Delaine. He's
willing to give the PCs his ship if they just help him get away.

Why hasn't the
Captain snuck off with his young bride yet? To answer that question,
the GM turns to the Places section and rolls up a hazard. The result
is “Sentient”, which means that there's an intelligent enemy between
the Captain and the ship. The GM mulls over the possibilities for a
while, and decides the Captain wasn't the only survivor. His first
mate made it out too, and blames the Captain. He's gathered together a
small band of offworlder rebels and is seeking to loot ruins and harm
Delainers, because he can't operate the ship without the Captain's
security codes and he's not sufficiently talented to hack the locks
himself.

At this point, the GM looks at the adventure and identifies the bits
he needs to flesh out. He needs to detail the Captain, the first mate,
the offworlder rebels, and the Delainer security chief who will seek
to apprehend the PCs if they're not sufficiently stealthy. All of
these people will need combat stats. The Captain's wife, the
offworlder reservation locals, and other bit NPCs are unlikely to get
into a fight, and don't need stats.

The GM decides he doesn't need a map for the offworlder reservation
settlement, but he does need a map of the terrain between the
settlement and the hidden ship. He downloads a suitable terrain map
from the web for that. On the map, he plants a few Wilderness Ongoings
from the Places table that the PCs may or may not encounter depending
on how they chart their course.

The last detail to
flesh out is the first mate's rebel camp, and how the PCs might get at
the starship they're guarding. The GM decides that it's not reasonable
for the first mate to have accumulated a vast number of minions, but
there are too many for the PCs to comfortably engage. The PCs will
have to think of some way to distract them, or possibly sic the
Delainer security chief on them before they can get to the ship. It's
not the GM's job to hand them a solution, so they'll have to puzzle it
out on their own.

With that done, the starting adventure is ready. The GM might add some
more details and fluff, but what he has is a playable start to a
campaign.

# XENOBESTIARY

A band of interstellar adventurers can expect to encounter a wide
range of creatures in the course of their travels. Whether the hungry
fauna of an uncharted planet or the trigger-happy gunmen of an alien
organ smuggler, a GM needs to have the relevant statistics at hand to
manage probable hostilities.

\*


<a id="handling-potential-combat"></a>

# Handling Potential Combat

Before picking foes from this chapter,
however, a GM should make sure that the enemies chosen and the perils
generated are appropriate for the situation. This does *not* mean that
the enemies have to be an “appropriate” combat challenge for the PC
group, one that they have a reasonable chance of defeating. It means
that they should be appropriate to the location and role they fill in
the setting.

If there's a stretch of wilderness adjacent
to a human community, a party-eating hellbeast should not be lairing
there without some notice by the locals. If such an unstoppable horror
does exist secretly in the wilderness, the fact that it is hidden
should be somehow explained or meaningful. NPCs notice hazards next
door, and PCs who pay attention should hear about that danger before
they end up walking into its cave.

In the same vein, if the PCs run into a bunch of street thugs, the
hooligans should not be exhibiting Spartan discipline and crack
military expertise unless the PCs have gone slumming on a planet of
genetic super-soldiers. The goons might actually not be much of a
combat threat at all, and dangerous only for the potential grudges the
PCs could earn in executing them.

Lastly, don't add combat encounters that are unavoidable. There are
very few realistic situations where the only possible result is a gun
battle. A group of trigger-happy mercs might happen to be sitting
directly on top of the party's objective, but if there's no way to
lure them away or sneak past them&#x2013; or worse, if you're not prepared
to allow the PCs to *try* to lure them away or sneak past them&#x2013; then
the players will learn not to try to solve problems with anything but
a hot gun barrel.

Combat in ***Stars
Without Number*** is dangerous. Every squeeze of a trigger risks
killing a novice adventurer, and even a veteran of countless heroic
deeds can get mowed down in a hurry by a half-dozen goons with mag
rifles. If your adventures funnel the PCs into near-unavoidable
firefights or saber-toothed alien monsters, the PCs are going to
suffer casualties. A certain degree of death can add spice and
excitement to a game and help make player choices feel more
meaningful, but inevitable gory disembowelment in the third
inescapable pirate brawl of the day is just tedious.

\*


<a id="the-reaction-roll"></a>

# The Reaction Roll

One of the GM's most important tools for managing encounters with NPCs
is the ***reaction roll***. Whenever the PCs first meet with a creature
or NPC, the GM should roll 2d6 and consult the following table.

2d6 Reaction Result

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<td class="org-right">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The result should
be taken in context. If the PCs just happen to run into a pack of
hab-complex gangers, a positive result might simply mean the gangers
think it's a bad idea to interfere with the PCs. That same result when
meeting a bored starport bureaucrat might mean she's feeling
magnanimous, and is willing to help the PCs accomplish their purpose.
In general, low results make the situation more hostile than the
predictable baseline, while high results make the NPC more friendly or
cooperative than they might normally be under the circumstances.

Reaction rolls are
important because they help a GM adjudicate a situation in a
potentially surprising or interesting way. If the PCs are crossing a
radioactive badland crawling with violent scavenger tribes, the GM
might just reflexively assume that every scavenger band they encounter
is immediately going to reach for their scrap-guns. A reaction roll is
a cue for the GM to pause and think, and a friendly result can open up
a situation with far more potential novelty than the sixth consecutive
gun battle. Conversely, even if everything seems to suggest an NPC
should be helpful and friendly toward the PCs, a negative result can
get the GM thinking about potential reasons *why* the NPC is so
hostile towards supposedly allied PCs.

An NPC or a group's initial reaction is not the last word, of course.
A silver-tongued PC might be able to talk them out of hostility or
induce them to do the party a favor, and more pragmatic offers of
money, favors, or incipient violence might also sway their attitudes.
Such manipulation happens after the initial attitude is determined,
however, and what exactly the PCs offer or threaten will usually
depend on how the NPC is initially reacting to them.

\*


<a id="humanity"></a>

# HUMANITY

 to form the great majority of the NPCs that the
heroes encounter, whether as patrons, companions, or the targets of
their guns. In many cases a GM won't need to bother with combat
statistics for an NPC. They might be so unmartial that they can
present no serious threat to a party of hardened freebooters, or so
distant that there's no real chance that they'll become engaged in
combat.

In others, however, it's necessary to decide how much a particular NPC
is worth in a fight.

The example human opponents here assume normal baseline humanity.
Those who have received extensive cyberware, gengineering, psychic
augmentation, or other exotic treatments may have abilities far in
excess of their normal brethren, including unique powers and special
abilities.

\*


<a id="degrees-of-danger"></a>

# Degrees of Danger

Most human NPCs on advanced, civilized planets are of almost no use in
combat. By societal training and personal inclination, they are almost
incapable of responding to lethal threats with a quick, decisive
reaction. Citizens of less peaceful societies, where violence is a
commonplace, will have more useful reactions to such hostilities. Men
and women who have been hardened to combat by experience or training
will also respond more effectively.

The combat statistics provided here cover the usual range of human
martial talent. At the bottom are those soft citizens of peaceful
worlds and at the top are those engines of mortal ruin who are the
most dangerous men and women in the sector. Even more heroic appetites
for slaughter can be found in those who have been altered by genetic
engineering or advanced technical modifications, but such paragons of
pain are special cases to be judged by the GM accordingly.

When assigning combat statistics to NPC, it's important not to be
influenced by the personal prowess of the PCs. If country estate is
protected by ordinary security guards, then the guards should *be*
ordinary security guards, whether or not the party could reasonably
hope to defeat a dozen such protectors in open combat. The universe
does not scale to the PCs. If a party of untested novices finds
themselves facing a squad of elite killers, they should *run*. If
those famously lethal killers encounter the PCs six levels later,
their fame might get abbreviated in a hurry by the PCs' grim new
expertise.

This even-handedness is important in creating a plausible, functional
world for the players to operate in. If they know that challenges will
be scaled up or down to give them a “fair fight” then it hardly
matters what challenges they choose to face. Planning to carefully
avoid excess dangers and betting on overcoming more reasonable threats
makes their choices meaningful in your game world, and encourages the
players to engage carefully with the setting.


<a id="using-the-table"></a>

# Using the Table

The table provided in this section gives you benchmarks for some basic
NPC types and then a selection of specific examples. When you're
creating your own NPCs, you can use the benchmarks to get an idea of
where they should be, and the specific examples can be pulled during
play when you're in need of quick opponents to stock your adventures.

The table provides simplified combat statistics. NPCs don't normally
have foci, specific skill levels, attribute scores, or any of the
other details that add complexity to PCs. Nor do they have classes or
class abilities. Instead, simpler totals and summaries are used to
account for these other factors. You can give NPCs class powers and
foci if you wish, or even create an NPC as if they were a full-fledged
PC, but that kind of detail and work is more than most NPCs are worth.

***HD*** is the NPC's ***hit dice***. The overwhelming majority of NPCs
have only one hit die. Only men and women with a history of surviving
violence and dealing with mortal peril should have more than one hit
die. Just because an NPC is “important” doesn't mean they have more
hit dice. The CEO of an interstellar megacorp probably has one hit
die, as does the president of the planetary government. Conversely,
the grizzled warrior-king of a lostworlder monarchy or a poison-wary
bishop of a church where promotion is through mortality might have
half a dozen hit dice. The most danger-hardened legends of a sector
should have about ten hit dice, or more if they've been somehow
altered by gengineering or advanced technology. An NPC's ***hit
points*** are rolled at 1d8 for each hit die.

***AC*** is the NPC's usual Armor Class. This will vary with the armor
they're wearing, and some NPCs might have an included +1 or +2 bonus
if they're especially dexterous, but the listed score reflects the
armor they usually have on. By default, this is street armor that is
not obvious to casual inspection. Some entries are marked “primitive”,
meaning that their armor is ignored by advanced weapons, while others
are marked “combat”, meaning that they wear very obviously protective
armor. Such NPCs might need to wear less obvious gear in some social
situations. A few of them are marked “powered”, meaning that the NPC
normally has access to some kind of advanced power armor that renders
them immune to primitive weapons. When creating your own NPCs, give
them the armor that is appropriate to their role and situation.

***Atk*** is the NPC's attack bonus. For the sake of simplicity, this
includes any attribute modifiers, skill bonus, or other extra
lethality that the NPC might have earned. For most NPCs, their attack
bonus is equal to their hit dice. Martial NPCs might have an
additional bonus on top of that, or even attack twice with each Main
Action.

***Dmg*** is the damage the NPC inflicts in combat. For human
combatants, this depends on the weapon they're using, with most
ordinary men and women carrying no real weapon. Very capable warriors
might do additional damage on top of the weapon's roll, from +1 to +4
points.

***Move*** is the distance the NPC travels when they take a Move action
in combat. For humans, this is ten meters, though gengineered or other
boosted subjects might be able to move faster than this.

***ML*** is the NPC's Morale score, their likelihood of retreating when
in danger. When an NPC faces unusual peril, they need to make a Morale
check on 2d6. If they roll equal or less than their Morale score, they
withstand the danger and continue fighting. If they roll more than
their Morale, they break. Poorly-trained combatants will simply run
for their lives or beg for mercy, while more hardened ones will make a
fighting withdrawal to a place of safety. PCs never need to make
Morale checks.

Most groups will need to make a Morale check the first time one of
their members is killed or disabled, and the first time it looks like
they're losing the fight. If they succeed in both checks, they'll
continue fighting as long as it doesn't seem hopeless. NPCs with no
martial aptitude at all must also make a Morale check when lethal
combat begins; on a failure, they're too shocked, frightened, or
disbelieving to do anything useful, and will stand frozen, run in
terror, or try to ignore what's obviously happening around them.

***Skills*** summarizes the NPC's general aptitude at skill checks
related to their profession or role. When the NPC needs to make a
skill check or compete in an opposed skill check, they may add this
skill bonus to their roll if the test relates to role. If the activity
has nothing especially to do with what the NPC would be good at, they
cannot add this bonus, and just roll the skill check unmodified. Most
NPCs will have this at +1, while skilled professionals will have it at
+2, and exceptionally gifted and expert NPCs will have it at +3 or
+4. Sector-wide legends will have it at +5.

***Saves*** are the single saving throw score that all NPCs use whenever
they need to make a saving throw. Whether Mental Physical, or Evasion,
the NPC rolls against this single target. Most NPCs have a save score
of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down.

# Psychics and Special Traits

When building NPCs with psychic powers or other special abilities,
it's usually not worth the effort of rolling them up like PCs. Just
assign them a few abilities you think will matter during the game and
give them a third of their hit dice in maximum Effort, rounded up.

In the same vein, gengineered humans or rare virtuosos might have
abilities akin to Foci or unique powers. Just assign them as fits the
situation, and don't worry about making them like PCs.

# Robots and VIs

The prevalence of robots varies between sectors. Some positively teem
with sentient VIs programmed for various purposes, while others have
hardly any robotics at all beyond industrial automation. The creation
of particularly sophisticated bots, especially sentient-seeming VIs,
is critically influenced by the local metadimensional energy
environment. With an unfriendly higher-order energy shadow, the
intricate quantum flux of VI “brains” cannot function properly. True
AIs are immune to such vagaries, but True AIs are almost impossible to
create in bulk, even for the lost industries of the Terran Mandate.


<a id="expert-systems-and-vis"></a>

# Expert Systems and VIs

In the vast majority of sectors, robots are operated by expert systems
programmed to carry out a specific kind of work. These expert systems
may feign human intelligence, but they are non-sentient and incapable
of dealing with environments and situations outside their normal
operational scope. The more sophisticated and expensive the expert
system, the more flexible it is about handling events within its
purview.

In some sectors, however, the local environment is suitable for the
creation of extremely sophisticated expert systems bolstered by
quantum neural nets. It is a constant point of debate over whether the
resultant “Virtual Intelligences” are truly self-aware or simply give
a perfect impression of such. Some sectors hold the former, and grant
VI full human rights, forbidding their makers from implanting
behavioral imperatives. Most sectors believe the latter, using VIs as
a labor force programmed to deeply enjoy their utilitarian function.
VIs in such sectors can be bought, sold, and mistreated much as any
other piece of property.

While VIs have or can mimic human-level intelligence, they can also be
programmed with behavioral imperatives or curbs, giving them a deep
urge to perform a certain kind of work or an unbreakable inability to
carry out certain kinds of acts. Most service VIs are programmed with
imperatives to love their work and be thoroughly happy in carrying it
out, as well as with curbs against harming human beings or allowing
themselves to be damaged. These impulses are overwhelming, but not
especially nuanced; the more specific and complex the programmed
psychological limit, the more prone it is to failure or misguidance.

VIs are not True AIs. They do not have a quantum identity core and
they are inexorably tied into the specific hardware and chassis they
were created to operate. While mods and adjustments can be made to
this “birth body”, the VI cannot be transplanted into a new chassis,
nor can they survive the destruction of their body.

VIs are much more difficult to produce than non-sentient expert
systems. The quantum growth process is much more reliable and
tractable than that used to create a True AI, but it still fails
annoyingly often. As a consequence, even sectors where the environment
allows the creation of VIs often prefer to use simple, cheap,
reliably-replicable “dumb” expert systems for mundane tasks.

# Expert System Bots

The robots listed in the adjacent table are standard-issue expert
system bots, each one equipped with a level 1 expert system. Each
expert system is programmed to handle a particular role: security,
tour guidance, industrial labor, household cleaning, personal
companionship, child care, or some other general field. The most basic
programming and cognitive hardware counts as a “level 1” system. More
sophisticated work allows for level 2 programming, up to level 4 as
the maximum for most TL4 sectors.

Each level of expert system beyond the first comes with upgrades to
the robot's durability, danger management, and exception handling
skills. They also add to the robot's base cost; a level 2 expert
system doubles a robot's base cost, for example. The table below gives
the various expert system levels, the hit die and saving throw bonus
granted by each, the attack bonus a given level adds, and the skill
check modifier to be applied to checks related to the bot's intended
function.

Whenever the bot is put in a position not covered by its programming,
it needs to make a confusion check. The GM rolls 2d6, adding its skill
bonus, against a difficulty based on the strangeness of the
situation. A situation partly within its usual compass might be
difficulty 7, while a completely uncovered event would be difficulty
9, and a situation that is both completely uncovered and clearly
dangerous would be 11. On a success, the expert system does something
reasonable and in line with its function. On a failure, the expert
system does what it's normally meant to do in an inappropriate way or
direction.

Damaged bots can be repaired by someone with at least Fix-0 skill and
a postech toolkit. One unit of spare parts and fifteen minutes of work
can repair a number of lost hit points equal to the bot's expert
system level. Expert system bots reduced to zero hit points are
destroyed and cannot be salvaged.

Expert system bots do have “morale” of a kind; when destruction seems
imminent, most are programmed to retreat. This can be overridden by
owners.

# Virtual Intelligences

In sectors where VIs can still be manufactured, the price is
equivalent to ten times the cost of an equivalent expert system bot.
Thus, a stock companion bot upgraded with VI programming would cost
25,000 credits. To give a top-of-theline heavy warbot with a level 4
expert system VI wiring would leave the bot costing a tremendous four
million credits.

VI wiring does not integrate well with conventional expert system
programming. The same static procedures and protocols that can make a
level 4 expert system so good at its specific task are difficult for a
human-like VI intellect to process, and it requires intensive and
expensive cognitive reinforcement to allow the VI to take advantage of
these resources. As a consequence, it is very rare for VIs to be
implanted in high-end expert system bots.

Most VIs do not develop additional skills or competencies, nor do they
exhibit personal growth or changes in personality. They are the way
they have been programmed, even if inhibitor curbs and behavioral
imperatives are absent.

Some VIs, however, are different. For whatever inexplicable reason,
these VIs are capable of learning and growing as human beings are.
They lack the potential for godlike intelligence possessed by True AIs
and they cannot make effective use of supplementary cognitive
resources as True AIs can, but over time and with experience, these
VIs can become as skilled and capable as any human.

Such “clever” VIs are an annoyance in sectors where VI bots are
common. Buyers don't want their receptionist bots to suddenly decide
they'd rather be poets, and while behavioral imperatives and inhibitor
curbs still have an effect on clever VIs, some of these bots can
“out-think” their limits and sidestep these blocks. Some worlds allow
clever VIs to exist as free citizens, while others consider them
public nuisances to be scrapped if they wander off from their owners.

VI bots are more durable than their ordinary cousins. If reduced to
zero hit points by trauma less than a hit with a Heavy weapon or
similar complete ruin, they can be repaired with 24 hours of work by
one tech with Fix-0. Jury-rigging a downed VI back into operation is
much faster, allowing them to “heal” with spare parts as if they were
an ordinary bot. If reduced to zero HP again before a 24-hour
overhaul, however, they perish.


<a id="types-of-bots"></a>

### Types of Bots

While a wide range of bots are available on the market in most
sectors, the selection given here cover most of the robots likely to
be encountered by PCs. Most civilian bots are programmed to avoid
harming humans, but such programming can be overridden by sufficiently
determined owners.

***<a id="org3c852ac"></a>*** are ubiquitous, cheap and reliable droids that can
clean up detritus and keep an office, street, or private home tidy.
Their small size and limited array of tools make them useless in a
fight save as targets or convenient explosives carriers.

***<a id="org1ce0dff"></a>*** are sometimes found guarding locations.
They're not smart enough to handle complex human interactions, but
their tireless determination is convenient when guarding a place that
few humans are expected to enter. Most models use a stunning touch
that non-lethally disables targets, while less gentle bots are
equipped with guns or melee weapons.

***<a id="orgdbc4ef9"></a>*** and ***<a id="orgead9e6f"></a>*** are found at work sites
and in starships or other complex technical edifices. Expert system
repair bots are extremely efficient about dealing with standard
failures and damage, but they can “panic” when faced with crises
beyond their usual operating parameters. Industrial work bots are
slow, tough, heavy machines most often used for lifting and
manipulating heavy objects in need of laser welding or other shaping.

***<a id="org8f2358c"></a>*** range from nannybots and petbots to
specially-designed “companions” for other purposes. The latter are
strictly regulated on many worlds, either to encourage reproduction,
to quash their use for reprehensible urges, or out of perceived fears
of societal decay and decadence.

***<a id="org8ae4124"></a>*** are designed on humanoid lines so as to easily use
standard human vehicles and equipment. The chaotic and confusing
nature of warfare leaves most soldier bots of somewhat limited utility
without a human bot wrangler to direct them, but when a wave attack is
needed, a simple self-preservation toggle can be flipped off and the
iron horde can be aimed at a foe.

***<a id="orgf5f9d24"></a>*** are ogreish engines of war with integral plasma guns
and the ability to attack twice with each Main Action. In addition,
most are capable of mounting a Heavy weapon which may be fired in lieu
of the plasma guns. They're most often used as mobile heavy weapons
platforms for squads in the field.


<a id="robots-in-your-campaign"></a>

### Robots In Your Campaign

A GM is not obligated to include VIs or ubiquitous robotics in her
campaign. Adding these elements can have a significant effect on a
setting, and sometimes they can prove to be a distraction from the
sort of play that the group wants to have. A GM is always well within
her rights to simply decide that the sector lacks the necessary
metadimensional environment for VI production and is short on many of
the critical minerals for producing expert system bots. Outside of
industrial assembly lines and mindless extraction work, labor is
performed by humans.

Sometimes, however, a GM will want to include VIs in her sector,
either because she's emulating a genre where intelligent robots are a
commonplace, or because a particular player wants to play a PC VI, or
because she simply likes them.

If a GM does decide to add VIs to her setting, she'll need to decide
how common they are and how most of the worlds in the sector treat
them. The simplest way to do this is to gently gloss over the economic
and social impact of VIs. The world operates much as it does today,
with humans doing most of the work and VIs serving only occasional
functions as showpieces of the wealthy or off-stage laborers in
industry. They are programmed to love their work, they're “happy” in a
robotic sense, and the various worlds of the sector give little
consideration to wider issues of VI rights or the morality of
programmed VI behavioral imperatives.

Other GMs will want to increase the impact of VIs on particular
worlds. Perhaps some of them have largely replaced their low-skilled
members with VI laborers, and the replaced humans are either
frustrated and angry or kept pacified by robotic dole payments. Other
worlds might dispute the lack of rights that most VIs have, insisting
that a VI ought not to be programmed with behavioral imperatives at
“birth”, but be allowed to choose its own functionality. Of course, it
might be that almost no one would bother to build them in that case,
but such crusaders might believe it better that a VI never be “born”
than that it be created in servitude. In brief, the GM can pick some
aspect of VI existence and use the conflicts inherent in it to spice
up the sector.

Expert system bots are less disruptive to a campaign because they come
with less moral baggage that a society has to deal with. It's easy for
a GM to simply decide that most expert system bots are only smart
enough for simple industrial tasks or menial labor, and that the
impact they have on the local economy doesn't necessarily force it
into some strange futuristic pattern. There are still poor janitors,
grouchy middle-aged security guards, and cynical street-corner
prostitutes in an age of robotic labor.

Some PC groups will be very keen to buy robots of their own, the
better to help in their adventures. So long as you keep an expert
system's limitations in mind, this shouldn't be disruptive, and it
would make an excellent sink for a party's excess money.


<a id="vi-player-characters"></a>

### VI Player Characters

In campaigns where the GM allows it, a player can choose to make a VI
as a player character. They do this by spending their free focus pick
on one of the origins listed below. These origin foci have only one
level, and normally can only be taken during character creation. In
exceptional cases, a human PC transformed into a full-conversion
cyborg might be allowed to take it later.


<a id="special-vi-rules"></a>

### Special VI Rules

All VI PCs have the same attributes, hit points, abilities, and
character classes as humans do, but normal VIs cannot be Psychics nor
take the Partial Psychic class option for Adventurers. They are
created the same way as any other human PC and start out at first
level. While they may have been built to be a particular type of bot,
they use their own statistics, and not those for their type here. VIs
that are not wearing armor normally have Armor Class 10, just as
humans do.

VIs need neither sleep, eat, nor drink, requiring one Type B cell per
week of operation away from readily-available current. They are immune
to vacuum but suffer degradation from radiation as humans do. They
cannot be poisoned or diseased by normal forms of toxin. They can be
reprogrammed, altering or erasing their personality and behavioral
limits, but such mental remodeling takes at least an undisturbed month
to execute by someone with at least Program-1 skill. Most VIs will
fight to their destruction to avoid such a fate.

VIs can be healed with spare parts and the work of someone with Fix-0
skill. VIs can always repair themselves, even without the requisite
skill. Each unit of spare parts heals lost hit points equal to the
VI's character level and takes fifteen minutes to apply. VIs cannot
normally be affected by biopsionic healing effects.

VIs reduced to zero hit points but not entirely smashed are
incapacitated and Badly Damaged. Removing this quality requires 24
hours of work by a technician and at least one unit of spare parts,
after which damage can be repaired as normal. As a field expedient, a
tech can jury-rig a Badly Damaged VI in the field, healing it with
spare parts at the normal rate and speed. If such a bot is reduced to
zero hit points again while Badly Damaged, however, it must make a
Physical save or be permanently destroyed.

VIs are intimately connected to their specific hardware, and cannot be
transplanted into new forms. Cosmetic alterations can be made,
however, and equipment can be grafted into the VI's chassis. Such
built-in equipment costs twice as much as a standalone component and
takes a week to properly integrate into the VI's system. A VI can have
a total number of encumbrance points worth of additional gear grafted
onto it equal to half its Constitution score, rounded down. Such gear
may require its own separate power source or ammunition supply. VIs
cannot make use of cyberware.


<a id="android"></a>

### Android

You were built as an android, a robot indistinguishable from a human
without a medical-grade inspection. Most androids are “companion”
bots, though other VIs with roles that involve significant human
interaction may also be built as androids. Minor scuffs and cuts don't
reveal your robotic nature, but if reduced to zero hit points, your
unnatural innards are obvious.

***Level 1:*** Gain a bonus skill related to your intended function. You
have all the usual traits and abilities of a VI robot.


<a id="vi-worker-bot"></a>

### VI Worker Bot

You were built for industrial or technical labor, where a human face
was an unnecessary luxury. Most such VI bots are humanoid, if only to
more conveniently manipulate human-scale devices, but their inhuman
nature is obvious.

***Level 1:*** Gain a bonus skill related to your intended function.
Choose an attribute associated with your work and gain a +1 bonus to
its modifier, up to a maximum of +2. You have all the usual traits and
abilities of a VI robot.


<a id="vi-vehicle-bot"></a>

### VI Vehicle Bot

Some VIs were instantiated in actual vehicles rather than conventional
humanoid bodies. Most were purely synthetic in origins, but some
sectors retain the techniques for brain transplants into non-human
bodies. Some polities have been known to conduct full-body
cyberneticization of soldiers into tanks, warships, attack
helicopters, and other military vehicles. As a vehicle, you are
usually equipped with manipulator arms that can be used on adjacent
objects. You may operate the individual elements of your vehicle as if
they were your own limbs, attacking once per round with a mounted
weapon of your choice.

***Level 1:*** Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. Pick a vehicle acceptable to
the GM, usually a drone, hoverbike or gravcar. You become that
vehicle. You retain your usual attributes but gain the vehicle's Armor
score. You are Armor Class 10, modified by your Dexterity score. A
tech can improve your Armor Class by aftermarket modifications, adding
up to three times their Fix skill to your Armor Class at a cost of
1,000 credits per point of improvement.

You use the vehicle's hit points until your own normally-rolled hit
point score exceeds that number. Many VI vehicles purchase a drone or
humanoid robot body to carry on board and employ for remote operation
in areas unsuitable for a vehicle; you can pilot a single surrogate
body in lieu of your own Main Action, provided there's no ECM to jam
the control transmissions.


<a id="beasts"></a>

### Beasts

Most alien beasts are simply flavor for a world, odd creatures to
decorate the background and provide some light interest for the
players. Sometimes, however, a GM needs a genuinely dangerous beast,
either to occupy some perilous wilderness or to threaten the PCs and
their allies.

When creating a beast, work from your needs. Build the creature with
the statistics and role that you need for your adventure, and then
decorate those basic statistics with the creature's appearance,
special hazards, and behavior.


<a id="creating-beasts"></a>

### Creating Beasts

To build an alien beast, it's easiest to start with some Terran
referent. A completely alien and exotic creature with no relation to
any earthly life form tends to be very difficult to explain to players
and it can be awkward for the GM to guess its normal behavior.

The tables on the opposite page provide some basic suggestions for
styling the essential animal features of the beast. Start with the
“Basic Animal Features” to get the creature's general theme, and then
move on to identify its body plan. You might then add on some novelty
to its limbs or skin, decide the main weapon it uses to hunt prey or
defend itself, and choose a general size for the animal.

The basic animal features serve only as a starting point for your
creativity. The creature might have a mammalian general plan, but you
could then decide that its “fur” is a stiff, glassy mineral exudate
that slashes anything that bites or strikes it. It can be helpful to
stick to one basic animal type for a given alien world, with all the
creatures the PCs encounter sharing similar broad features or common
traits.

While a fully-developed ecosphere might include countless different
evolutionary strategies, sticking to just one or two in play helps
characterize a world and give a sense of consistency to its fauna. If
all the dangerous creatures of Scutum have thick moss-colored armor
plating, then the PCs will be able to guess that a strange creature
with thick moss-colored armor plating is probably an import from
Scutum.


<a id="swarms"></a>

### Swarms

Sometimes a beast is only meaningfully dangerous in vast packs, like a
swarm of ants or a squealing tide of ravenous rats. Other times beasts
are found most often in huge herds rather than as lone individuals.

To create such a swarm, take the basic animal type and quadruple its
hit dice. For tiny creatures that have only 1 hit point, give the
swarm 4 hit dice. The swarm gets its usual attack against anyone in
contact with it, but on a miss, it still does the minimum possible
damage to the target unless the victim is immune to its attacks. Thus,
a rat swarm that has a +1 attack bonus and does 1d2 damage on a hit
would roll that attack against every PC caught in the swarm. On a hit,
they would do 1d2 damage, and a miss would still do 1 point.

Any attack against the swarm automatically hits, assuming the weapon
is useful. Firing a pistol into a creeping carpet of ants is
singularly useless, but waving a flaming torch in front of rats or
throwing a grenade into the swarm might help dispatch the pack.


<a id="beast-behavior"></a>

### Beast Behavior

Many alien creatures will have no inherited aversion to humans, and
will not fear them. Predators will hunt them if they look like food
and prey will ignore them if they don't look like predators.

In combat, predators will only fight to the death if maddened or
cornered. Sane predators cannot afford to get hurt while hunting. In
addition to the usual times for Morale checks, beasts must make an
additional check the first time their “prey” harms the predator.


<a id="importing-creatures"></a>

### Importing Creatures

Aside from the beasts you can create with these charts, an endless
supply of fantasy monsters and exotic creatures await lifting from
other old-school games. Almost any of the “monsters” found in
traditional old-school role-playing games can be imported almost
unchanged into ***Stars Without Number***, requiring little more than an
attack bonus and Armor Class conversion. Reskin them to fit your
needs, and voila; you have your beast.

### Styling the Beast

You can use these tables to assemble a general look for your beast.
First, roll on the basic animal features table to get a general
“theme” for the creature. If you ever need inspiration for particular
details about the creature, just refer back to its basic theme.

Next, roll on the tables below to get additional inspiration. Note
that you don't have to roll on any particular one. Instead, just use
them to fill in the blanks and spark your own creativity, editing
things when necessary to fit the creature's intended role.

Harmful discharges usually use a normal attack roll and inflict the
typical damage on a hit. At your discretion, some discharges may have
additional effects, such as poison, gear destruction, ongoing acidic
damage, or an explosive area of effect. Appropriate Physical or
Evasion saving throws might be called for to avoid the worst of such
perils.

You can roll three times on the table above to generate a poison for a
creature, or pick to suit your needs. Most effects incapacitate a
victim, though blindness or ongoing damage may not wholly disable a PC.

PCs can usually attempt a Physical save to resist a poison. Toxins can
be treated with a medkit or antidote stim. If the medic lacks the
specific antidote to a poison, they can make an Int/Heal skill check
to try to halt it. The difficulty is usually 9, with one check
allowed.

### Aliens

Exotic alien races are a staple of science fiction, and most GMs
running ***Stars Without Number*** are going to want a few types of
sapients to round out a sector. Some GMs might prefer to run a
strictly human game, leaving humanity alone in this particular corner
of the cosmos, but other GMs will want to have the details of a few
alien races in hand, if only to help envision the kind of artifacts
and ruins that they might have left behind. This section will discuss
the role of aliens in a game and a process for creating your own alien
races.


<a id="the-use-of-aliens-in-the-game"></a>

### The Use of Aliens in the Game

When adding an alien race to your sector, it's necessary to keep in
mind the ultimate purpose you have for including them. A given species
might be fascinating to you, but if they don't actually help to
accomplish something for your game it's likely that the players will
simply gloss over their existence. By having a concrete purpose in
mind for a race you can ensure that the players have a useful reason
to interact with them.

Aliens are useful as antagonists. The classic “bugeyed monster” trope
has survived for a reason; unthinkingly hostile and uncommunicative
beings make great fodder for brute physical struggle. Making these
monsters part of a sapient, tool-using species allows them to scale
upward in threat the way no beast can, and continue to imperil even an
experienced, well-equipped band of adventurers.

Antagonism can take more forms than simple combativeness. Aliens can
want things, and want them for reasons that would make no sense at all
to a human. Biological imperatives, exotic religions, alien
philosophies, and customs born on completely un-Earth-like worlds can
all justify goals and purposes that would be entirely irrational for a
human being. Humans might find themselves at cross purposes with these
aliens without ever fully understanding why the beings are pursuing a
given goal.

From a GM's perspective, this is a wonderful trait for building
adventures. If you need aliens to pursue some goal, however bizarre,
you can simply add a trait to them that makes that goal important. For
example, if you need aliens to be obsessed with wiping out the humans
on a given planet, you can simply decide that the planet is their
ancestral homeworld, to which they must return every thousand years in
order to perform a great spawning rite. The presence of the humans
there defiles the world, and the aliens grow increasingly frantic as
the time for the rite approaches.

Aliens also make excellent patrons for many of the same reasons that
they make good antagonists. You can give them a good reason to want
almost anything, and players are unlikely to balk at it as unlikely or
implausible. If you need to give the players a reason to go somewhere,
do something, or find something, you can use aliens to drive the
process. The matter might be so important to the aliens that they find
themselves willing to employ human agents to accomplish their ends, or
it may be that only humans have the numbers and strength to help them.

Aliens are occasions for exploration and discovery. While this may not
have the immediate adventure utility of an antagonist or a patron, one
of the things about sandbox gaming that appeals to many players is the
opportunity to go out and discover new things. The universe is full of
bizarre and exotic beings, and there can be a lot of enjoyment in
learning about their cultures and traits. Most players aren't
interested in a full-dress anthropological study of an alien race, but
there is an excitement in visiting uncharted worlds and meeting
strange and wondrous beings.

In some cases, this exploration doesn't even need live aliens. The
universe is laden with numerous ancient alien ruins, and players can
get a good conception of a long-lost race simply from examining what
they've left behind. A GM with a firm grasp on a species' psychology
and physiology has much of what he needs to create their abandoned
cities and outposts and to stock them with art, artifacts, and
remnants for the enticement of exploring PCs.

Humanoid species make the most widely useful aliens, and most of the
species you create should probably be of that variety. Aliens that are
too hard to understand tend to be more animate plot devices, operating
by utterly incomprehensible rules and motivations. Human-like races
allow more scope for diplomacy and response to an alien culture,
because their societies are fundamentally comprehensible by humans.


<a id="the-like-and-the-others"></a>

### The Like and the Others

Most alien races in the universe of ***Stars Without Number*** can be
divided up into two different classes &#x2013; the Like and the Others. The
Like are those species with intellects and societies that are at least
somewhat comprehensible to humankind. They may have exotic biologies
and strange customs, but humans can understand their motivations and
deal with them within a more-or-less comprehensible framework.

The Others are those species that are simply too alien for human
communication. Entities of sentient lithic structures, congeries of
crystal, even intelligent waveform interactions created by the
interplay of energies through alien rock formations&#x2026; the Others are
simply too different for humans to understand. Their goals are
incomprehensible, their technology is often hard to even recognize,
let alone use, and it's possible that they don't even realize that
humanity is a sentient species. The Others are generally avoided if at
all possible, though at times “wars” break out when an Other species
vents anger on humanity for reasons unknown.

Other races are rare, but some xenologists have suggested that they
may be much more common than humanity imagines. Places that would
never support Like life might be teeming with the bizarre offspring of
Other organisms, unnoticed because human scouts haven't bothered to
look in such unpromising places. Many Other species might not even be
recognized as life by humanity.


<a id="alien-biology"></a>

### Alien Biology

As a rule of thumb, it's easiest to make Like aliens some flavor of
humanoid. They may have a few extra limbs or somewhat different body
geometry, but humanoid aliens tend to be easier to build and run than
those with drastically different body types. There's less need to
adjust human assumptions about architecture, technology, and clothing
than there would be for a species of six-legged centauroid mothmen. Of
course, if you enjoy the prospect of working out the ramifications of
having four gripping hands and organic wheels, you shouldn't feel
shackled to the humanoid shape.

Aliens of the Other type can come in any shape or size, largely
because they aren't intended to be comprehensible. Their technology
and architecture doesn't need to have any link with human conceptions
of such; some Others may not even use technology as humans understand
it, but instead manipulate their environment with inborn abilities or
subtype-creatures of their own species. Most Other species function as
plot devices in a game, and it's not necessary to put the same effort
into detailing their “biology” if the species aren't intended to make
human sense in the first place.

Humanlike aliens are just that; extremely close to humans in outward
appearance. They might have unusual skin or hair coloration, different
hair growth distributions, an odd number of fingers, cranial ridges, a
novel skin texture, variant ear shapes, or different average body
builds or sizes, but they largely appear like humans. Xenobiologists
postulate that the human shape is simply a very successful
evolutionary route on Earth-like planets, and other worlds with
similar conditions are likely to produce similar sapients. Crank
scientists tend to favor theories of pan-galactic Creators that spread
humanlike shapes throughout space; these theories conspicuously fail
to take into account the dramatically different DNA and internal organ
makeup of many humanlike aliens.

In general, it's easiest to pick a particular real-world type of
organism as a basic template for an alien race. The reality of their
biology might be totally different, but using a terrestrial animal as
a basic pattern can help you fill in details of structure and
appearance that can otherwise be difficult to extemporize.

Avian aliens favor birdlike features. Feathered tails, wings, beaks,
drastic coloring differences between males and females, skin either
partially or fully covered in feathers, hollow bones, and clawed feet
and hands are all traits that might be present in an avian-flavored
alien. Such avians might have remarkably good vision or show unusual
talent as pilots thanks to an evolutionary predilection for thinking
in three dimensions.

Reptilian aliens can range from the classic “lizard man” look to a
more subtle combination of pebble-scaled skin, membrane frills, broad
bodies, cold-bloodedness, nictitating membranes, an exceptional sense
of smell, thick claws, powerful builds, sharp teeth, and fine scales.
Bodies may be broad and thick like that of a lizard, or perhaps
sinuous like that of a snake. Reptilian aliens might be found
especially on damp, watery worlds, and might be outright amphibious
over all or part of their life spans.

Insectile aliens are usually possessed of chitinous “skin” and one or
more pairs of compound eyes. Membranous wings aren't unknown, but are
probably vestigial and useless on all but the smallest or lightest
aliens. Insectile aliens might have sucking mouthparts if their
primary food source is plant sap- or blood- or might use chewing
mandibles instead for a more solid diet. Insectile aliens that
function as a hive collective are something of a classic trope, but
there's no reason that a species can't instead take after more
solitary hunting insects such as beetles or spiders.

Mammalian aliens might have very human-like appearances, or they might
have fur, muzzles, claws, or quadrupedal modes of locomotion.
Mammalian aliens are easy to conceptualize and describe, but if you
want to play up the alienness of them, you'll likely need to make sure
they have some dramatic social or cultural difference, or some unique
element of physiognomy.

Exotic aliens are built out of parts and materials that aren't
normally found in Terran life forms. A humanoid might be composed out
of a kind of organic plastic that makes up much of their home planet's
biochemistry, or be composed of an intricate array of interlocking
crystals and woody organic elements. You should pick one or more
materials that aren't normally part of an animal's body and have them
play a major role in the alien's biology. As a consequence, this kind
of alien is probably highly dependent upon their home world for food
and other biological necessities. If not, they likely spend a lot of
effort synthesizing vital materials out of local supplies.

Hybrid aliens combine aspects of two or more of the types described
here, and you can mix and match their components to create some blend
that suits your purposes. Such hybrids might exist in multiple
environments, or be in a transitional evolutionary state.


<a id="alien-psychology-and-lenses"></a>

### Alien Psychology and Lenses

There are many different ways to fabricate a useful and interesting
alien race, ranging from careful development based on unique biologies
or environments to more abstract methods of defining interesting
traits. The method this section offers is intended to provide a GM
with a few tools for producing alien races that feel sufficiently
strange in play without leaving the GM groping to figure out how a
given alien would react to a situation.

The first step is to understand that a Like alien race is
fundamentally human. They may be shaped differently, they may dwell in
a radically different environment, but they think, feel, and desire
largely as humans do. Human vices and virtues almost certainly exist
in their society and they are susceptible to the same sort of
temptations and provocations that move humans. If you want to know
what an alien is like, the first thing to do is to think of what a
human is like.

The difference for aliens, however, is that they are very strongly
influenced by one or two emotional or social traits, called
***Lenses***. Everything about them, from the way their society is
structured to the way they deal with strangers to the dreams they have
for their own future revolves around these Lenses. The result is an
alien culture that may not be deeply nuanced, but it is a culture that
is very easily remembered by players and easily played by GMs. If you
know that the two Lenses for the alien race of Churq are Collectivity
and Fear, you know that a given Churq is going to be cowardly and
intensely social. Courageous individuality will be noxious or
incomprehensible to it and its social roles will revolve around the
safety of the collective against the dreadful perils of the outside
world.

Lenses should not be taken as the last word about a species. GMs who
want to spend more time on the species' psychology can elaborate as
they wish, and all of the guidelines given for a Lens can be easily
adjusted to whatever flavor the GM wishes to use. GMs can pick or roll
one or more Lenses from among the following list, or generate their
own as desired.

<a id="collectivity"></a>

### Collectivity

These aliens might be hive-like in their social structure, natural
communists, or simply very closely attached to the customs and
interests of their social group. The importance of the individual is
thought to be minimal, and members will cheerfully and readily
sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. To willfully refuse to
accept the consensus of the whole is an unspeakable sin, and to be
separated permanently from one's social group is a fate worse than
death.


<a id="curiosity"></a>

### Curiosity

This species is insatiably curious, constantly prying into the affairs
of those around them. Spying for this race carries no opprobrium
whatsoever, and while they may attempt to maintain privacy for certain
doings, all assume it a given that matters will be discovered in the
end. They love to explore new places and meet new sapients, and while
they may be brutally indifferent to the fates or treatment of these
beings, they're always eager to observe them. Their societies tend to
operate in a profoundly transparent manner, and some view the keeping
of secrets as an automatic indication of malicious intent.


<a id="despair"></a>

### Despair

These aliens have fallen prey to a pervasive sense of failure and
loss. Perhaps they are the remnants of a once-glorious empire or the
survivors of some cataclysmic disaster for their people. What they
once loved has been destroyed, and their sources of comfort and
courage have failed them. Superficially, they might resemble those
species that crave pleasure and indulgence, but their disports only
serve to numb them to the existential gloom that taints the species.
Their leadership is desultory at best, and sophisticated social
structures tend to degrade into loose, diffident associations as their
members no longer have the hope necessary to perpetuate them.


<a id="domination"></a>

### Domination

These aliens are consumed by a desire to conquer and rule, both each
other and any other species unfortunate enough to share the stellar
neighborhood. Some among them can be fair and thoughtful rulers, but
others are nothing more than vainglorious tyrants. Among themselves,
society tends to be organized in intricate and clearly-marked
hierarchies, with advancement progressing along both official and
illicit routes. These aliens constantly test their leaders, forcing
them to maintain their position through strength and cunning.


<a id="faith"></a>

### Faith

Such a species is driven by religious concerns, organizing their
society around their faith and its clergy. Most such species have a
single faith. Others make do with a number of different religions, all
followed with a fierce devotion. Challenges to this faith are not met
with outrage so much as blank incomprehension; for these beings, the
truth of their religions is so self-evident that it seems irrational
to ever question it. Those who most perfectly embody the teachings of
their creeds tend to become rulers, their lives and will taken as an
example for others.


<a id="fear"></a>

### Fear

These aliens live in constant fear. They may be natives of some lethal
death-world, survivors of a species-annihilating cataclysm, or simply
evolved from weak and easily-devoured prey animals. The world is
terrifying to them, and their societies are based around hiding or
protecting themselves from these dreads. The most revered members are
those who are best hidden or best protected, and who can give
protection and concealment to their fellows. Most of these races are
quite cowardly by human measure, but occasionally they can be driven
into a frenzy of terror in which they fight with the courage of the
doomed.


<a id="gluttony"></a>

### Gluttony

These aliens devour. They are rapacious consumers, whether it is of
food, living space, energy, or some other resource. They will do
almost anything to increase access to this resource and are deeply
indifferent to the needs of other species, and often of their own
fellows as well. To consume greatly is glorious for this species, with
the greatest and most respected members being those who have the
greatest stockpiles of the resource to consume, or who provide the
most to their followers. The purpose of existence is to eat, and all
good things are understood as different modes of devouring.


<a id="greed"></a>

### Greed

These aliens are enormously greedy. Status depends almost entirely
upon personal wealth, and their lives are spent in accumulating the
greatest stores of value possible. Some focus on production, creating
the wealth for their own benefit, while others seek to make a profit
on trade. Some such greedy species have intricate property laws to
safeguard what is accumulated, while others are little more than
bandits among their own kind, too avaricious to let law interfere with
their greed.


<a id="hate"></a>

### Hate

There is something these aliens hate, and it defines their culture
completely by their opposition to it. It may be these aliens are
rampant xenophobes, loathing all who are not of their own kind. There
may be acrid religious or political divisions among them, with
individuals identifying completely with their sect and despising all
the others. It could be an ancient enemy among the stars, a rival race
that has wounded them so greatly as to be unforgivable. These aliens
may spar and maneuver for power among their own kind, but all goals
and individuals are to some degree subordinated to the needs of their
immortal hate.


<a id="honor"></a>

### Honor

Whatever sort of society the race has, it is one obsessed with
honorable behavior. Members will obey the social mores and
expectations of their roles at all costs. Personal sacrifice for the
sake of upholding these principles earns a member glory and esteem.
Gaining advantage by means of inappropriate behavior or failing in
one's duty is shameful, and an entity that has compromised its honor
too greatly may prefer death to continued existence.


<a id="journeying"></a>

### Journeying

This species has an incurable wanderlust. Perhaps they roam the stars
in fleets of massive spike drive ships, or they may make steady
circuits of the nearby stars to connect their worlds and exchange
people among them. More technologically primitive species might sail
the waves of alien seas or make nomadic journeys across the continents
of their world. Few of these aliens can ever be happy in remaining in
one place for long, and they are forever scouting new worlds and new
lands simply for the pleasure of being there a little while.


<a id="joy"></a>

### Joy

These aliens are relentless bon vivants, constantly in pursuit of
pleasure and enjoyable excitement. Beauty, grace, and the inspiration
of passion are their highest virtues. Those who produce the most
exquisite art or inspire the most extravagant delight have effective
rule over their fellows, though such species tend to be
loosely-organized at best. The brute necessities of life are
acknowledged as a necessity, but their societies are willing to
sacrifice a great deal of efficiency and practicality for the sake of
immediate satisfaction.


<a id="pacifism"></a>

### Pacifism

The race is remarkably peaceful and nonviolent in nature. Few species
survive while being totally averse to violent self-defense, but this
race will never choose violence against living creatures as a means of
gaining advantage or retaliating to wrongs. Among their own kind,
violence is abhorrent and unnatural, and it is probable that the
species is either herbivorous or subsists by photosynthesis. A
pacifist race may be peaceful, but there are more ways to do injury
than through personal violence; the cession of trade, the destruction
of property, and the incitement of divisions and confusion among their
enemies are all tools this race knows well. Pacifist species can also
be quite oppressive at times, with an underclass constitutionally
incapable of defending their possessions or privileges with force.


<a id="pride"></a>

### Pride

These aliens are suffused with an enormous pride in their own culture
and species, and instinctively consider themselves to be superior to
the lesser beings they may encounter. A prideful species is not
necessarily a hostile one; some such races have a certain sense of
*noblesse oblige* toward their “lessers”, and some species' pride
shows in a resolute refusal to lower themselves to deceit, cruelty, or
avarice. More often, however, this pride manifests in a casual
contempt for the interests of their inferiors, and a single-minded
focus on personal advancement and glory among their own kind.


<a id="sagacity"></a>

### Sagacity

These aliens love intellectual pursuits above all others. Logic,
wisdom, and erudition are all prized as the best and most glorious
expressions of their nature, and their rulers are invariably
sage-kings of remarkable depth and breadth of understanding. Such
understanding does not necessarily stand in well for good judgment,
and sagacious alien civilizations are notorious for overreaching in
their ambitions. Stupidity and ignorance are moral failings to this
race, and some of them treat very harshly those species that they do
not feel to be their intellectual peers.


<a id="subtlety"></a>

### Subtlety

Such a species is enormously cunning and patient in character, willing
to endure years of suffering calmly in order to bring about some
intricate plan. They shun open display of emotions or opinions,
masking such things behind protocols of bland correctness. To reveal
one's true opinion about some contentious matter is a mark either of
profound trust or a sign of obvious incipient treachery. The true
ruler of such a species is almost never who it seems to be.


<a id="tradition"></a>

### Tradition

This species devoutly reveres the past and the ways of their
ancestors. Social interactions are stiffly ritualized, and society is
ornate with the customs, traditions, and habits of their
forebears. Innovations of any kind are viewed with deep suspicion, and
the most favored solutions to problems are those which have been
employed before. Members of this species are intensely uncomfortable
when forced to exercise their own judgment, and doing so in
contravention to the past is almost impossible for them. Only when
faced with a completely novel situation is any degree of personal
initiative likely to be shown, and even in that case, the alien will
try to reconcile it to some existing tradition.


<a id="treachery"></a>

### Treachery

This species is uniformly treacherous and untrustworthy. Bargains and
agreements are kept only so long as they are useful to both
participants, and truthfulness is simply a tool to be placed next to
deceit. There is no sense of acrimony or anger among these aliens at
the inevitable betrayals that make up their societies; they consider
it good and laudable that an individual should seek its own best
interests, and those who can most perfectly manipulate each other are
naturally those most worthy to rule, for the health of the society
directly influences the power of its head.


<a id="tribalism"></a>

### Tribalism

The aliens are fiercely tribal, divided up into myriad small groups
that are as often at war with each other as they are cooperating. Such
tribes tend to be built along familial lines, though some tribes are
volitional in nature, representing different political or
philosophical groups. A given alien's loyalty is to its tribe before
its species, and it is not uncommon for their enemies to use one group
against another.


<a id="wrath"></a>

### Wrath

The race is hot-tempered, prone to fits of personal violence. Disputes
are settled by force, though rarely to the point of death among their
own kind. Outsiders can expect swift and bloody retaliation for any
insult or slight, and the prospect of death rarely intimidates these
beings. Their chief mode of emotional expression is anger; wrath at
obstacles, fury at enemies, and a slow smoldering burn when neither
are available.


<a id="alien-social-structure"></a>

### Alien Social Structure

Once the Lenses for a species are chosen, you'll need to establish a
few important facts about the aliens. You need to make some decisions
about their social structure, the goals of their leadership, their
relationship with humanity, and the sort of examples that the PCs are
likely to encounter.

Determining the social structure for the aliens can be done by
answering a few basic questions and elaborating outward from the
answers to whatever degree of detail you find useful or enjoyable. In
most cases, whatever social structure you hit on will apply only to
those aliens in a specific sector. Far-flung races might have wildly
different modes of rule among their different fragments, assuming that
biological necessity doesn't push them to certain kinds of societies.

First, decide how the species is ruled. You can roll randomly on the
table below, or simply pick something that seems appropriate.

</table>

-   ***Democratic:*** The species has a broadly democratic organization,
    with individual members having a formal say in the choice of
    leadership. This voting need not necessarily be based on numbers; it
    might be a vote with money, military power, religious influence,
    possession of certain biological traits, or any other metric that
    makes sense to the aliens. Whatever the specific currency, politics
    for this race tends to revolve around persuasion and diplomacy
    rather than use of military force to determine species-wide
    policies.

-   ***Monarchic:*** The species is ruled by a single being, with such
    rule justified by custom, biological imperative, divine mandate,
    personal influence, or familial ties. Such monarchic societies
    almost invariably have a “noble” caste of some kind to act as
    administrators and officials for the monarch, and they usually make
    up the pool from which new monarchs are chosen. The specific title
    for a monarch will usually depend on the justification for their
    rule: Chieftain, Emperor, Broodmother, High Priest, Dictator, Chief
    Elder, or so forth.

-   ***Tribal:*** The species is organized into multiple tribes based on
    lineage, philosophy, or geographical location. Tribes set their own
    laws and policies, and are prone to intense internal struggles over
    resources and status. There may exist a “paramount tribe” that
    inflicts its will upon the others through brute strength or
    traditional esteem. Tribal leaders tend to be personally
    distinguished, and usually have earned their position through
    personal accomplishments and the broad support of their tribemates.

-   ***Oligarchic:*** The species is led by a number of powerful or
    revered figures who work in nominal harmony. Individual oligarchs
    might have their own goals, but no single member has the strength to
    enforce its will upon the whole. These oligarchs might be the
    product of hereditary inheritance, or individual members of the
    species might one day aspire to join their numbers.

-   ***Multipolar:*** The species has more than one leadership
    organization. Roll 1d6; on a 1-2 it has two, 3-4 indicates three,
    and 5-6 indicates four. Roll on this table the requisite number of
    times to determine the nature of these organizations. Some such
    multipolar institutions operate in parallel; a tribal organization
    headed by one gender, for example, that determines the division of
    goods while a monarchic head of a different gender makes decisions
    about the race's relations with other species. Others are directly
    in conflict, such as a monarchy struggling against a democratic
    neighbor.

Once you've determined the type of leadership the species favors, you
can sort out any important details about their social structures. By
default, you should assume that the aliens have some sort of analog
for any job or role that humans find necessary. The Churq might be
cowardly collectivists, but even they need plumbers, soldiers, and tax
collectors. You can take whatever human society suits you as the base
template and then interpret the relevant roles through the Lenses
you've picked for the species.

For example, if the Churq have the Lenses of Fear and Collectivism,
their tax collectors might be honored exemplars of communal
redistribution, judiciously taking from those who have excess in order
to give to those who have less. The Churq gladly offer resources to
the tax collector, because the offering proves that they producing
excess resources, which proves to them that they are secure and safe
in their plenty. A Churq who fails to produce for the collective
suffers gnawing terror at the idea of dangerous scarcity and will
redouble its effort to contribute to the group.

Conversely, Churq soldiers might invariably be found in small groups,
as an individual Churq is incapable of fighting effectively without
the encouragement and safety of their brethren around them. They might
specialize in terror attacks against enemy civilians, their intimate
acquaintance with fear encouraging them to use it as a weapon against
their enemies&#x2026; their unarmed, noncombatant enemies, preferably. A
war between Churq collectives might never have a single open battle,
but instead a sequence of ambushes and terror attacks until one
collective loses its nerve and submits.


<a id="alien-technology"></a>

### Alien Technology

Alien races tend to come in two different technological flavors. Some
are quite technologically primitive, either through being too new to
sapience to have had time to develop scientific arts, or because they
are unfortunate enough to inhabit a very resource-poor world. Such
aliens might demonstrate remarkable ingenuity in making the most of
their surroundings, but some worlds make advancement prohibitively
difficult for a species.

Other aliens possess spike drives, advanced weaponry, fusion power,
and all the other ornaments of a sophisticated star-faring
civilization. These aliens are usually the remnants of a more
expansionistic period, colonies and outposts that have evolved into
homeworlds for the survivors of the civilization. This golden age is
normally terminated by some kind of species-wide disaster, whether
natural in nature or the result of savage internal warfare. These
worlds are usually too absorbed in their own affairs or ennui to have
much interest in expansion.

Most advanced aliens have tech roughly equivalent to human TL4, though
they're often slightly superior in some areas while being somewhat
worse in others. A few old, sophisticated races have the equivalent of
TL5, though these species often produce devices and artifacts that are
difficult for humans to use effectively. A handful of alien worlds
show technology that is simply impossible for humanity to replicate at
any known tech level, with artifices and creations that seem more
magic than mundane science.


<a id="aliens-in-the-sector"></a>

### Aliens in the Sector

What role do these aliens play in the sector? Do they have their own
sector homeworld, dominated by them and their kind, or do they instead
live in enclaves on a human-ruled world? Do they live in orbital
habitats, or convoys of massive spike drive ships? You should place
the species according to your needs, preferably in a location that the
players can be expected to eventually experience.

You should also make a few quick decisions about how these aliens are
generally treated by humans, and how they treat humans in turn. Some
dangerous or obnoxious species might be unable to function in human
societies, while others might be normal citizens on a sophisticated
pan-racial planet. Some beings might be horrific or repellent to
humans through no fault of their own, and subject to persecution by
those who live around their “alien ghettos”. Such aliens are likely to
respond to the misuse much as humans might, albeit in ways strongly
influenced by their Lenses. A Wrathful species might respond with
brutal violence toward persecutors, while Joyful ones might try to win
their tormentors over by demonstrating the beauty and delight they can
bring to their friends.


<a id="alien-motivation"></a>

### Alien Motivation

Individual aliens are likely to have as wide and varying a set of
motivations as any human. Alien governments and ruling institutions,
however, are liable to have more specific goals. Acquiring a new
homeworld, ensuring the suppression of would-be pogromchiks, vengeance
against a hated world or species, or any other such long-term goal
would be suitable for an alien government.

The broad goals of an alien government are usually obvious, but the
subtle plans and maneuvers they use to accomplish these purposes can
be less clear. PC groups can be commissioned by alien officials to
perform acts or retrieve objects that have no immediate relevance,
only to discover later that they played a crucial role in some
enigmatic gambit. By the same token, they might stumble across some
alien operation that has no obvious purpose, earning bitter enmity for
their disruption of plans they never knew existed.

In either case, there should usually be some way for the PCs to
discover alien motivations, in the case that they actually care. It
can be prohibitively difficult to negotiate with such beings without
understanding their desires, and parties with little appetite for
combat may be frustrated if they find their would-be counter-parties
acting in an impenetrably obscure way. Some adventures might revolve
heavily around the challenge of understanding an alien power's true
goals and the steps they're willing to take to achieve them.


<a id="alien-player-characters"></a>

### Alien Player Characters

If a GM decides to allow players to play members of an alien race,
she's going to need to do a little extra work. Each alien race is
represented by a focus; to become a member of that race, the player
spends their initial focus pick on choosing that origin. They then get
the natural benefits of belonging to that alien species.

As a general rule, the GM should pick two of the following benefits to
make up an alien's origin focus, or three if a couple of them are
relatively minor perks. If the Vree-Tak are a Proud Warrior Race of
aliens, they might have both an *Aptitude for Violence*, for example,
and an *Origin Skill* related to combat.

It's also possible to apply particular weaknesses to an alien species
as compared to a human baseline. Such weaknesses are rarely a
significant game-balance consideration for PCs, however, as it's
common for players to choose such alien races and then select classes
and roles that are unhindered by the species' flaws. If you want to
use a flaw as a game-balance tool in a species, make sure it's broad
enough to hinder a wide range of concepts, and not just disqualify a
few roles.


<a id="aptitude-for-violence"></a>

### Aptitude for Violence

All members of this species are good at hurting things. They gain a +1
bonus to their normal attack bonus. Thus, a 1st level alien Expert
would have an attack bonus of +1 instead of +0, and a 1st level
Warrior would begin with a +2 bonus.


<a id="environmental-native"></a>

### Environmental Native

As a minor perk, the alien is able to survive in a relatively common
hostile environment, such as underwater, in hard vacuum, amid lethal
radiation, or so forth. If the alien *requires* this environment, it's
no net benefit at all.


<a id="innate-ability"></a>

### Innate Ability

All members of this species have one or more natural abilities beyond
those possessed by humans. Perfect vision in the dark, tracking by
scent, wireless tech interfacing, a lack of need for food and water,
or some other talent might apply. As a quick inspiration, you can look
at the equipment or cyberware list and give them the natural use of
2-3 items. Optionally, you might give them an ability equivalent to a
single psionic technique, plus one point of Effort to fuel it if
needed.


<a id="natural-defenses"></a>

### Natural Defenses

The creature has a hard shell or sharp talons. The alien has a base
Armor Class of 15 plus half their character level, rounded up. If you
give them body weaponry such as claws or fangs, have it equivalent to
a medium advanced weapon. Weaponry alone is a very small advantage,
since it's so easy to acquire otherwise, so you might not count this
as a benefit if all you give a creature is a sharp set of teeth.


<a id="origin-skill"></a>

### Origin Skill

All members of the species are particularly good at something. They
might all be capable warriors, have unique technical aptitude, be
persuasive speakers, or otherwise have a shared knack. Receive an
appropriate skill as a bonus. Warrior-type races might be allowed to
pick from either Punch, Shoot, or Stab.


<a id="psychic-aptitude"></a>

### Psychic Aptitude

These aliens are all psychically gifted. The PC must either be a
Psychic or take the Partial Psychic class option from the Adventurer
class. Their maximum Effort score is increased by one point.


<a id="shapeshifting"></a>

### Shapeshifting

The alien is either an amoeboid blob that can manipulate objects with
extruded pseudopods and flow through small spaces, or it can actually
mimic other species or objects. The former trait is a minor benefit at
best, but the latter one might be sufficient to mimic biopsionic
shapeshifting, or might have a more restricted range of possible
shapes.


<a id="strong-attribute"></a>

### Strong Attribute

All members of the species are strong, fast, tough, clever,
perceptive, or charming by human standards. Pick an attribute
appropriate to the alien; that attribute gains a +1 bonus to its
modifier, up to a maximum of +3. Thus, an alien from an exceptionally
strong species with a Strength score of 10 would have a Strength
modifier of +1 instead of +0.


<a id="tough"></a>

### Tough

The alien is big, or hardy, or made of unusually durable biological
components. Whenever they roll their hit dice to determine their
maximum hit points, the first die they roll always counts as the
maximum. Thus, a first level Warrior alien would always start with 8
hit points. When rolling hit points at second level, they'd count
their first die as 8 and roll on from there. Further hit dice that
roll a 1 are rerolled.


<a id="unusual-movement-mode"></a>

### Unusual Movement Mode

The alien can fly under normal gravity conditions, or make short-range
teleportation hops, or can climb sheer walls as if they were flat.
Whatever the details, they can use their Move action to travel
unusually.


<a id="useful-immunity"></a>

### Useful Immunity

The alien is impervious to some threat that's relatively common. A
significant or common immunity, such as against bullets, lasers, edged
melee weapons or the like would be a major benefit, while immunity to
minor threats such as toxins, diseases, radiation, or falling damage
might only qualify as a minor perk.

# FACTIONS

Interstellar merchant combines, tyrannical planetary empires, sinister cults of eugenic perfection&#x2026; groups such as these all have a role to play in ***Stars Without Number***. Such organized, motivated groups are known as ***factions***, and this chapter describes ways in which a GM can use them to further events in a sector. Player characters that attain sufficient power and fame might even establish their own factions, and the rules below give ways to handle inter-faction fighting and the advancement of each group's goals.


<a id="using-factions-in-your-game"></a>

## Using Factions in Your Game

The faction system in ***Stars Without Number*** is intended to provide
a GM with a constant stream of background activity, adventure hooks,
and visible setting reactions to PC actions. It is an optional system,
one that a GM can take or leave as their own campaign suggests, but it
can provide an interested GM with tools to simplify the business of
running the campaign's background.

The faction system is not meant to be a stand-alone game that doesn't
require GM involvement. It's not balanced for equivalence between
sides, isn't designed to incentivize optimal play choices, and some
situations will certainly require a GM to referee them. The system is,
however, built to produce the kind of output that a working GM is
likely to find most useful.

Some GMs will have no use for a formalized faction system. These
people feel most comfortable simply dictating the outcome of conflicts
and ambitions among the assorted groups and organizations in their
campaign. When two groups clash, the results will be determined by
what the GM thinks is most reasonable.

This is a perfectly valid way of doing things, and indeed, when a GM
decides how some off-stage organization interacts with a fully-statted
faction they're going to have to make calls like that anyway. Yet the
disadvantages of such a method are twofold.

First, it lacks surprise for the GM. By definition, the reasonable
thing always happens, and even the occasional randomizer tossed in
produces results that are to some degree predictable to the
GM. History and current affairs are full of wildly unlikely-seeming
outcomes, however, and sometimes the GM can benefit by seeing a
genuinely shocking result percolate out of some conflict. Even in the
absence of the adventure hooks such surprises create, not knowing
exactly how her campaign is going to shake out helps keep a GM
interested in events.

Second, an unstructured system has few prompts to goad a GM into
thinking of unexpected interactions between factions. A GM simply
provided with a list of NPC groups to write events for will tend to
reach for the interactions and outcomes that are foremost in their
mind, implicitly going along with assumptions about how things should
play out. If instead they're handed a slow-burn struggle between a
militant terrorist group with fanatical zealots for an asset and a
eugenics-loving religion with a crack team of lawyers, they're going
to think somewhat harder about how these two factions might play out
their conflict, and will get results that don't automatically feed
their assumptions.

One of the easiest ways to use the faction system is as a news chyron
for your campaign. After each faction turn, you can boil down events
to a few sentences apiece and hand them to your players at the start
of the next gaming session, letting them know what's on the news
channels and underground gossip boards of your campaign. If your
players get excited about one of the events, you can dedicate the next
downtime between sessions to brewing up an adventure related to their
efforts at involvement.

Another use of the system is as a way to formalize the setting
reaction to PC actions. If the last adventure involved the PCs utterly
discrediting the leader of a political party you're using as a
faction, you might scratch off the Demagogue asset that the party had
that represented that leader. A quick scribble gives you the news
crawl next session telling the PCs that the leader had decided to step
down to spend more time with her family.

The factions you write up are not the only organizations and groups in
your world, but they are the ones the PCs are most likely to care
about or the ones most pertinent to their current activities. You
don't need to keep the same factions active all the time; if the
campaign shifts focus halfway across the sector, you can simply freeze
the local factions until the PCs get back in their zone of
relevance. If you have the spare time and effort, you might even keep
them running, letting the PCs discover how things shook out when and
if they ever get back to that region of space.

In time, the PCs themselves can start creating their own factions to
contend with rivals and seek influence on a scale impractical for a
lone wanderer. While PC factions use all the same rules and faction
turn actions as NPC ones, they have the tremendous advantage of being
the focus of a veteran adventuring party's helpful interest. Almost
anything that can be accomplished by faction turn actions can be done
more quickly by the appropriate PC adventures.

This, of course, is an easy way for a GM to let the players write
their own adventure content. So long as the PCs care about their pet
factions or allied groups, their own ambitions and desire to help will
practically create whole sessions worth of adventure outlines for
you. Important NPCs in rival groups will become hated nemeses, hostile
assets will become the targets of their bad intent, and the players
will constantly be on the lookout for ways to augment their
allies. For the sake of your own time and effort, you should let them.


<a id="factions-assets-and-turns"></a>

## Factions, Assets, and Turns

A faction is any group that you intend to use as an important actor in
the sector. In theory, any organization could qualify as a faction;
every planetary government, business, religion, or club could be
described with the rules given here. Still, that kind of exhaustive
cataloging is neither practical nor profitable. Faction status should
be reserved for those organizations that will do things important to
the PCs or the background world. You should not bother creating more
factions for your game than you are actually using at that
moment. Save your effort for the groups that count.

It may be necessary to turn an organization into a faction in the
course of play. If the PCs suddenly take a deep interest in a eugenic
cult they recently faced on the jungle moon of Perihelion, it might be
useful for the GM to turn the group into a formal faction, the better
to understand how the PCs might injure it and what resources the cult
might have to fight back. Or it might be that the PC group's
interstellar trading cartel faction tries to topple a world's
tyrannical government, thus making it worthwhile to define the
tyrant's resources.

As a general rule, you shouldn't have more than five or six factions
at the start of your campaign, and fewer is quite possible. Fewer than
three tend to make for too much stability, however, and might not
generate enough activity to make for interesting news reports and
adventure hooks. Possible factions in a campaign might include
criminal groups, local religions, planetary governments, political
movements, terrorist organizations, noble houses, or any other band
that might conceivably be someone the players care about or some group
that might possibly hire or oppose the PCs.


<a id="defining-a-faction"></a>

## Defining a Faction

Factions have attributes consisting of six statistics, a homeworld,
and one or more tags.

-   ***Hit points*** measure a faction's cohesion, morale, and group
    unity. The higher a faction's hit points, the harder it is to break
    it up. A faction that loses hit points has lost cohesion somehow,
    either through the death of leadership, the demoralization of
    members, or the rise of fractious power blocs inside its
    structure. A faction needs time to recover from hit point damage. A
    faction's maximum hit points are based on its Force, Cunning, and
    Wealth, as given later in the chapter.

-   ***Force rating*** is the faction's general aptitude at applying
    physical violence, measured on a scale ranging from 1 to 8. A rating
    of 1 implies an organization with little or no aptitude for physical
    coercion, while a rating of 8 might be appropriate for a regional
    hegemon with a powerful, expansionist military. A high Force rating
    doesn't necessarily mean that the faction has much in the way of a
    standing army, but it does mean that the faction can think clearly
    about the use of force and is accustomed to military
    reasoning. Governments tend to have high Force ratings to represent
    police forces and military structures. Terrorist groups, mercenary
    bands, and other organizations that rely on brute violence also tend
    to have high Force ratings.

-   ***Cunning rating*** reflects the faction's skills at espionage,
    infiltration, internal security, and covert manipulation of other
    groups. A rating of 1 implies a completely visible faction with no
    resources for resisting infiltration, while a rating of 8 implies a
    faction of Illuminati unknown to all but a handful of paranoid
    conspiracy-mongers with tendrils of influence reaching to the
    farthest star in the sector. Eugenics cults, terrorist groups, spy
    agencies, and some religious groups tend to favor a good Cunning
    score.

-   ***Wealth rating*** indicates the faction's commercial, scientific,
    and industrial resources. A Wealth score of 1 means that the faction
    has little in the way of income or investments, no dedicated
    manufacturing facilities, and no laboratories or researchers
    available. A Wealth score of 8 is appropriate for some
    system-spanning merchant empire or the combine that runs the pretech
    manufactories of an untouched factory world.

-   ***FacCreds*** are a measure of the faction's general wealth and
    resources, spent to purchase and maintain assets or carry out
    faction operations. A FacCred doesn't necessarily represent a
    certain sum of credits so much as it represents logistics
    capability, available resources, and managerial focus. A faction on
    a primitive world may not have a single credit to its name, but its
    command of a legion of laborers and the food supplies necessary to
    feed them are a vast store of FacCreds all the same. All the credits
    in a sector do no good if they can't be effectively translated into
    a useful asset.

Factions also accumulate ***experience points***. They gain these points
from accomplishing goals, with the larger goals earning them
correspondingly more experience points. Once enough experience is
accumulated the faction can spend it to improve a rating. The higher
the rating, the more experience is necessary to raise it. It's vastly
more difficult to go from Force 7 to 8 than from Force 1 to 2.

The faction's ***homeworld*** represents the location of its core
leadership and support. Factions can always purchase assets and take
actions on their homeworld, even if they lack any other assets
there. By the same token, an enemy can always launch attacks against
the faction on their homeworld if the enemy is able to move in its own
assets.

-   ***Tags*** are special traits that relate to the faction's nature or
    special aptitudes. A cabal of rebel conspirators might have the
    *Secretive* tag, which gives a bonus to resisting certain attacks,
    or *Deep Roots*, which gives them a bonus to operations on their
    homeworld. Most factions have one or two tags.


<a id="faction-assets"></a>

## Faction Assets

Aside from the six statistics, faction also possess ***assets***. Assets
are facilities, contacts, trained units of specialists, or other
specific objects, places, or groups of value. A regiment of postech
infantry is an asset, as is a pretech manufactory, a master assassin,
or an interstellar shipping company.

Assets require certain ratings to support. A fleet of capital warships
isn't going to be useful to a faction with Force 3 no matter how much
wealth the faction has. It just doesn't have the infrastructure and
institutional mindset to use such an asset effectively.

Assets have ***hit points*** much like factions do. An asset reduced to
zero hit points by an attack is destroyed; either physically ruined,
hopelessly scattered, totally demoralized, or lost to a rival buyer.
Asset hit points can be regained with time for repair, reorganization,
or culling members suborned by other powers.

Assets have a ***purchase cost*** and sometimes a maintenance cost, paid
in FacCreds. The first turn that a faction fails to pay the
maintenance cost of an asset, it becomes unavailable for use. If the
maintenance cost isn't paid the next turn, the asset is lost.

Assets often have an ***Attack***. When an asset is used to strike at
another faction, the attack entry is used to determine what rating is
attacked and the amount of hit point damage that is done by a
successful hit. An asset without an Attack entry can't be used to
initiate a strike at an enemy faction.

A ***Counterattack*** line indicates the damage an asset does to an
unsuccessful attacker. If an attacking asset misses its strike against
the target, the target's Counterattack entry damage is done. An asset
without a Counterattack entry does no damage to a failed
attacker. It's quite possible to have an asset with no Attack but a
powerful Counterattack, making it useless at offense but very
dangerous to assault.

Assets have a ***type***, such as “Special Forces”, “Military Unit”,
“Facility”, “Starship” or the like. This type is mostly relevant when
factions wish to upgrade an asset, or some special tag applies only to
assets of a certain type.

Assets have a ***location***, usually the planet on which they were
purchased, though it might also be a deepspace habitat, a particular
moon, or some other general geographical location. Assets cannot be
used against different locations unless they are first transported
there, usually by means of a logistical asset.

Most assets also require a particular ***tech level*** to purchase. They
can be transported to worlds with lower tech levels, but they must be
purchased on a planet with a sufficient level of technology.

A faction may own no more assets of a particular type than they have
points in the relevant rating. Thus, a faction with Force 3 can own
three Force assets. In a pinch, a faction can exceed this total, but
each asset over the maximum costs an additional FacCred in maintenance
each turn.


<a id="the-faction-turn"></a>

## The Faction Turn

Faction actions are divided up by ***turns***. As a rule of thumb, a
faction turn happens once per month, or once after each adventure.
Turns might happen more or less often depending on the GM's preferred
pace of events. Each faction can usually take one action per turn.

At the beginning of each turn, roll a die that's no smaller than the
number of factions you have. Thus, if you've got six factions in the
sector, roll a d6. If you've got nine, roll a d10, and so
forth. Whatever number comes up is the faction that acts first; thus,
if you roll a 4, the fourth faction on your list acts first. Then the
one after it, and the one after that, and so forth, rolling over the
top of the list when necessary.

At the beginning of each turn, a faction gains FacCreds equal to half
their Wealth rating rounded up plus one-quarter of their total Force
and Cunning ratings, rounded down. Any maintenance costs must be paid
at the beginning of each turn. Assets that cannot be maintained are
unusable; an asset that goes without maintenance for two consecutive
rounds is lost. A faction cannot voluntarily choose not to pay
maintenance.

If a faction has no goal at the start of a turn, they may pick a new
one. If they wish to abandon a prior goal, they may do so, but the
demoralization and confusion costs them that turn's FacCred income and
they may perform no other action that turn.

At the end of each faction turn, the GM should translate the turn's
events into a few lines of rumor or news that can be related to the
PCs. A successful attack by the Lawyers of the Bright Dawn Guild on
the Perihelion government's Union Toughs might be reported as
“Neohuman rights activists on Perihelion applaud the election of
Parminder Smith to the leadership of the government-sponsored Transit
Workers Union. Miss Smith is a strong supporter of neohuman research
and legal emancipation.”

## Acting During A Turn

Factions can take several different types of actions, though generally
only one action per turn. The list provided consists of the usual
actions a faction might find useful; you should feel free to allow
variations on the list depending on the particular situation. PC
adventures always exist outside of the faction turn economy. If you
run an adventure involving the PC group's destruction of the Sorority
of the Golden Flame's secret laboratories on a volcanic planetoid,
then the faction's asset is simply destroyed, with no chance of
resisting.

A faction can only take one type of action per round, but they can
perform that action on as many worlds as they wish. A faction that
selects the *Attack* action, for example, can launch attacks on
multiple worlds, while one that selects the *Use Asset Ability* action
can use the special abilities of any or all assets they possess. This
limit on the type of action allowed in a round tends to slow down
events, allowing for the more gradual development of situations in
play.


<a id="faction-actions"></a>

## Faction Actions

The following list of actions includes the most common activities a
faction might choose to perform. The GM should feel free to add new
action types, or allow alternate choices if a faction wishes to do
something that doesn't quite fit the list below. As a rule, a faction
should only be able to do one thing per turn, but should be able to do
that same thing with any or all assets.

***<a id="org60b835e"></a>:*** Attacking is the chief way by which a faction assaults a
rival's assets and organizational structure. A successful attack can
damage or destroy an enemy asset, or even damage the leadership and
cohesion of an enemy faction. It's up to the GM or players to describe
an attack and its methods.

Attacks can only be launched against known assets. If a rival has
stealthed assets on a world, they cannot be targeted for an attack
until they've been discovered by a faction's intelligence agents.
Attacks can only be launched against assets on the same world as the
attacker.

To launch an attack, the attacker selects one or more of their own
assets and targets a rival faction with assets on the same world. One
at a time, each attacking asset is matched against a defending asset
chosen by the defender. Each attacking asset can attack only once per
turn, though a defending asset can defend as many times as the
defender wishes, assuming it can survive multiple conflicts.

Once matched, the attacker rolls 1d10 and adds the relevant attribute
for the asset. For example, a military unit's Attack might add the
faction's Force rating to the attack roll, while a cyberninja unit
might add the faction's Cunning to the attack roll. The defender then
rolls 1d10 and adds the attribute that the attack targets. In the
instance of the military unit, this might be an attack against Force,
causing the defender to add their Force rating to the roll, while
defending against the cyberninjas might require adding the defender's
Cunning rating. The Attack line of the attacking asset indicates which
attribute to add to the attack roll and which to add to the defense
roll.

If the attacker's roll exceeds the defender's roll, the attack is a
success. The defending asset suffers damage as given on the Attack
line of the attacking asset. If the defender has a [72.13](#orgc6f6648)
on the world, the defender may opt to let the damage bypass the asset
and hit the [72.13](#orgc6f6648) instead, causing damage to it and the
faction hit points. If the asset or [72.13](#orgc6f6648) is reduced to
zero hit points, it is lost.

If the attacker's roll is less than the defender's roll, the attack
fails. The defending asset can apply whatever damage their
Counterattack line indicates to the attacking asset. If the defending
asset has no Counterattack line, the attacker suffers no consequences
for the failed attack.

A tie on the roll results in both Attack and Counterattack succeeding.
Both attacker and defender take damage as indicated.

***<a id="orgb2ddf51"></a>:*** The faction buys one asset on their homeworld or
another planet on which they have a [72.13](#orgc6f6648). These assets
take time to assemble, and can neither attack, defend, nor grant their
special benefits until the beginning of the faction's next turn. The
faction must have a sufficient rating to buy an asset, and the planet
must have a tech level sufficient to support the asset's
creation. Only one asset can be purchased by a faction per turn.

***<a id="org5ea3c30"></a>:*** A faction can move to a different homeworld, if
they have a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) on the destination planet. This action
takes one turn, plus one more for each hex of distance between the old
homeworld and the new. During this time the faction can initiate no
actions.

***Expand Influence:*** The faction buys a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) asset on a
planet on which they have at least one other asset. The faction then
rolls 1d10+Cunning rating against similar rolls by every other faction
on the planet. Any of the others that equal or beat the faction's roll
may make a free immediate Attack action against the [72.13](#orgc6f6648)
if they wish. Other assets present on the planet may defend against
the attack as normal. The [72.13](#orgc6f6648) cannot be used until the
beginning of the faction's next turn.

To buy a [72.13](#orgc6f6648), the purchaser pays one FacCred for every
hit point the base has, up to a maximum equal to the faction's maximum
hit points. Bases with few hit points are relatively peripheral
outposts, easy to dislodge but cheap to erect. Bases with many hit
points are significant strongholds that would hurt the faction badly
to lose but are much harder to eliminate.

Factions may use this action to buy additional hit points for a Base
of Influence, paying one additional FacCred up to the maximum HP
allowed. It is possible to decrease a base's hit points with the
action as well, albeit without refunds. The base on a faction's
homeworld cannot be shrunk this way.

***<a id="org4697c9d"></a>:*** Change one asset to any other asset of the same type.
If the new asset is of a more expensive type, pay the difference. The
asset must be on a planet that allows the purchase of the new asset.
Turning a militia squad into elite skirmishers requires a tech level 4
world and governmental permission, for example. A refitted asset is
unable to attack or defend until the beginning of the faction's next
turn.

***<a id="org841fb05"></a>:*** Heal damage to an asset or faction. For one
FacCred, an asset heals points of damage equal to the faction's score
in its ruling attribute. More damage can be healed in this single
action, but the cost of repair increases by one FacCred for each
further amount repaired- two FacCreds for the second amount healed,
three FacCreds for the third amount healed, et cetera. If used to heal
a faction, the faction regains hit points equal to the rounded average
of its highest and lowest attribute ratings. This healing cannot be
hurried by additional spending. Use of this action allows the faction
to heal as many different assets as it wishes.

***<a id="orgc53b2c2"></a>:*** Gain half the FacCred cost of the asset, rounded down.

***<a id="org67b1e95"></a>:*** The faction seeks to become the ruling body of a
world. The faction must destroy all unstealthed assets on the planet
belonging to factions who oppose their attempt before they can
successfully take control. If all the assets cannot be destroyed in
one turn, the faction must continue the attempt next turn until either
successful or all of their own assets on that planet have been
destroyed or have left the planet. No other actions can be taken in
the meanwhile. Once all resistance has been crushed, the attacker must
maintain at least one unstealthed asset on the world for three
turns. If successful, they gain the *Planetary Government* tag for the
world.

***<a id="org67726a5"></a>:*** Use the special abilities of one or more
assets, such as the transport ability of logistics assets, or the
intelligence-gathering abilities of spy assets.


<a id="handling-special-cases"></a>

## Handling Special Cases

When in doubt, a GM should simply make a judgment based on their own
best sense of the situation. Despite this general case, there are a
few more particular situations that come up often enough to bear some
specific guidance in handling them.

Sometimes, a ground unit will choose to attack a starship unit, or
some other unit that seems to be beyond their reach. As a general
rule, you should allow this, and simply decide how it was that the
ground unit was able to cause problems for the starships. Maybe they
subverted officers, or sabotaged support facilities, or drove
logistical suppliers out of business.

Some assets require the permission of the planetary government to
raise them on a particular world or move them into that world's
system. The necessity of this will depend on how advanced the
planetary government is and how direct the contact. A TL2 planetary
government probably wouldn't even notice the arrival of a capital
fleet in their star system, let alone be able to do anything to
prevent it. Even so, native lawyers, bribed offworlder officials, and
hired mercenaries might still be able to harass a force the locals
couldn't bar from entering their territory.

Locations are considered general to a specific star system rather than
a particular world. The faction's marketers might be operating out of
the planetary capital, but for purposes of location, they're as much
in the system as a Scavenger Fleet floating around the rim. Getting
shuttles to and from wherever they need to go inside the system is not
a problem for most factions.

Sometimes two factions will want to merge for some reason. The
efficiency of this will depend on how much the factions like each
other and how close they are in function; give this propinquity a
rating from 1, for two factions that hate each other and don't do
similar things at all, to 9, for two factions that are in perfect
synchrony. Use 6 for two factions of average similarity. Whenever you
need to see how well the merger went, roll a compatibility check; 1d10
versus this number. If the roll is equal or less, it worked, and if
it's higher, the merger didn't work so well in that regard.

Now determine the Force, Wealth, and Cunning ratings for the new
faction. For each one, roll a compatibility check; on a success, use
the higher of the two factions' scores, while on a failure, use the
lower one.

For each asset, roll a compatibility check; on a success, the asset
belongs to the new faction, on a failure, it's forcibly sold. FacCreds
are totaled between the two factions, and the merged faction gets all
the Bases of Influence each originally had. Pick a new goal as well.
If the faction has assets its new ratings can't support, it keeps
them, but can't use *Repair Asset* on them.

PC adventures always overrule faction die rolls. If the PCs undertake
an adventure which results in the crippling or destruction of a
hostile faction's asset, that asset is destroyed without any need for
dice. In the same vein, if they swoop in to rescue some asset that the
dice declared was ruined and undertake an adventure that plausibly
salvages the situation, that asset comes back into existence. The
faction system is built to help create adventure hooks, not shut them
down.

By the same token, if a PC adventure seems to plausibly *create* an
asset for a faction, then that should be credited to the group. It is
entirely in your interest as a GM to let the players plot out
adventure goals and find motivation in helping a faction. Every
adventure they spend helping or harming a faction is one more hook of
engagement with the campaign world and one less adventure idea you
need to come up with.

If your factions are too quiet with a lack of interesting conflict
among them, don't hesitate to create that conflict. A sector full of
turtling factions that hide out and painstakingly build their
resources doesn't make for much engagement, so insert a personal
grudge or add a gold-rush opportunity.

When a faction buys an asset, they are not necessarily creating
something *ex nihilo*. They might have always had that particular
resource, but are only now mobilizing it effectively. A planetary
government with no military assets doesn't necessarily lack an army,
it just lacks an army that is useful to its current goals. buying and
using assets

Assets can be normally purchased on any world that has a Base of
Influence and sufficient tech level to support their creation. In a
few cases, however, acquiring an asset requires more than just
FacCreds and a planet.

Starship-type assets cannot be purchased on a world with less than
several hundred thousand inhabitants unless they can explain how the
ships are being provided or supported by another power. Planets with
very small populations lack such major infrastructure.

Some assets require the permission of a planetary government in order
to purchase them or move them onto the planet. This is not a
formality; the standing government's forces can physically disrupt any
attempt to recruit the asset on their world, or shoot it down in its
vulnerable entry phase. Whether or not this permission will be
extended will usually depend on the faction's relationship with a
planet's government, though bribes of 1d4 FacCreds can occasionally
suffice. Under no conditions will a government willingly permit the
entry of assets powerful enough to overthrow them.

Planetary governments cannot prevent the landing of assets without the
permission-needed quality. Such assets are too unthreatening and
nondescript to alert them until after they've already been formed or
have landed. Of course, there is nothing stopping them from attacking
these assets either directly or indirectly should they feel
threatened.

Only one asset can be purchased per turn by a given faction, and
assembling it takes time. The asset can neither attack, defend, nor
give any special benefits until the beginning of the buyer's next
turn.


<a id="using-faction-assets"></a>

## Using Faction Assets

As its action for the turn, a faction can choose to use the special
actions of one or more assets. They can trigger these special
abilities in any order, but each form of asset must be used all at the
same time; you cannot trigger Heavy Drop Assets to move a Monopoly
asset onto a world, activate the Monopoly ability to siphon cash, and
then use another Heavy Drop Asset to move the Monopoly back
offworld. All Heavy Drop Assets must be finished before Monopolies can
be triggered, and so forth. Unless specified otherwise, all asset
targets must be in the same stellar system with the acting assets.

In some cases, assets are called to make a test against another
faction, such as a Cunning vs. Wealth test. For these tests, the
acting asset's faction rolls 1d10 and adds their score in the acting
attribute, while the target faction rolls 1d10 and adds their score in
the defending attribute. If the actor rolls higher than the defender,
the action is successful. Certain tags may grant a faction extra dice
for these rolls, in which case the highest d10 out of those rolled is
used. These tests do not count as attacks, and no damage or
counterattacks are triggered.


<a id="bases-of-influence"></a>

## Bases of Influence

Bases of Influence are special assets, and use certain special rules.
A faction cannot buy assets on a world without a [72.13](#orgc6f6648),
though it can move assets purchased elsewhere onto the planet, and it
can always buy assets on its homeworld even if its [72.13](#orgc6f6648)
there is destroyed. Of course, that assumes it still has a Base of
Influence somewhere else.

First, a faction can only ever have one [72.13](#orgc6f6648) on a world
at a time. Bases of Influence cannot be moved once in place. Bases of
Influence cannot be purchased with a *Buy Asset* action. They can only
be put in place with an *Expand Influence* action. Bases of Influence
have a sale value of zero FacCreds.

The cost of a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) is equal to its maximum hit points,
which can be up to the owning faction's maximum hit points. Bases of
Influence do not count against a faction's maximum assets.

Damage done to a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) is also done directly to a
faction's hit points. If a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) is brought below zero hit
points, the overflow damage is not counted against the owning
faction's hit points.

As a consequence, a faction must decide how heavily to invest in a
particular [72.13](#orgc6f6648). A minor foothold on a world consisting
of a base with few hit points is cheap and risks limited harm to the
faction should it be destroyed, but it's also more vulnerable to being
wiped out by a rival group.

It's quite possible for a faction to be effectively destroyed by
smashing enough heavily-invested Bases of Influence on other
worlds. While the homeworld's Base might be in perfect condition, the
faction has so badly overextended itself in failed expansion that it
can no longer sustain itself as a going concern. The resources and
personnel that the homeworld needed to import are no longer available,
and the credits and effort spent on the now-destroyed Bases are
wasted. The backlash from this can be ruinous to any faction.

Every faction also has a homeworld. A homeworld is always
automatically equipped with a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) with maximum hit
points. If a faction moves its homeworld to a planet that already has
a [72.13](#orgc6f6648), the base on the new homeworld has its hit points
set to the maximum possible and the homeworld's [72.13](#orgc6f6648)
swaps in the hit point value that the destination world's base
originally had.


<a id="faction-goals"></a>

## Faction Goals

Factions usually have motivations and goals beyond simple existence.
To grow, a faction needs to accomplish goals that are in line with
their leadership's purposes. Successful achievement of these goals
helps the faction grow in strength and influence.

A faction can pursue one goal at a time. Once a goal is successfully
attained, the faction may select a new one at the beginning of their
next turn or delay until a good opportunity arises. If a faction
chooses to abandon a goal, the demoralizing effect of it and the waste
of preparations costs them that turn's FacCred income, and they cannot
perform any other action that turn.

A faction that successfully accomplishes a goal gains experience
points equal to the goal's difficulty. This experience may be saved,
or spent at the beginning of any turn to increase the Force, Cunning,
or Wealth ratings of a faction. Optionally, the GM might allow a
faction to buy a new tag if their deeds justify it.

It's the GM's choice as to what might constitute an appropriate goal
for a faction, but below are some potential goals and the difficulties
attached to each.

***<a id="org2f35db4"></a>:*** Destroy a number of Force assets of rival
factions equal to your faction's Force rating. Difficulty is 1/2
number of assets destroyed.

***<a id="org4ae60dd"></a>:*** Destroy a number of Wealth assets of rival
factions equal to your faction's Wealth rating. Difficulty is 1/2
number of assets destroyed.

***<a id="org42077f1"></a>:*** Destroy a number of Cunning assets of rival
factions equal to your faction's Cunning rating. Difficulty is 1/2
number of assets destroyed.

***<a id="org66e7336"></a>:*** Take control of a planet, becoming the
legitimate planetary government. Difficulty equal to half the average
of the current ruling faction's Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings. If
the planet somehow lacks any opposing faction to resist the seizure,
it counts as Difficulty 1.

***<a id="org0cb2c2f"></a>:*** Plant a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) on a new planet.
Difficulty 1, +1 if the attempt is contested by a rival faction.

***<a id="org317793d"></a>:*** Inflict a number of hit points of damage on enemy
faction assets or bases equal to your faction's total Force, Cunning,
and Wealth ratings. Difficulty 2.

***<a id="org188fb28"></a>:*** Don't take an Attack action for four turns.
Difficulty 1.

***<a id="org048ea06"></a>:*** Destroy a rival faction. Difficulty equal to 1
plus the average of the faction's Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings.

***<a id="org7072710"></a>:*** Have a number of stealthed assets on
worlds with other planetary governments equal to your Cunning
score. Units that are already stealthed on worlds when this goal is
adopted don't count. Difficulty 2.

***<a id="org8bcb385"></a>:*** Destroy a Force asset with a minimum purchase
rating higher than your faction's Force rating. Thus, if your Force is
3, you need to destroy a unit that requires Force 4 or higher to
purchase. Difficulty 2.

***<a id="org193f76d"></a>:*** Spend FacCreds equal to four times your
faction's Wealth rating on bribes and influence. This money is
effectively lost, but the goal is then considered accomplished. The
faction's Wealth rating must increase before this goal can be selected
again. Difficulty 2.


<a id="raising-faction-stats"></a>

## Raising Faction Stats

Faction attributes can be raised at the beginning of each turn, if
enough experience points are available. The cost of raising a faction
attribute rises as the rating rises. As a faction's ratings improve,
it becomes harder to destroy, and gains additional maximum hit points.

The maximum hit points of a faction are equal to 4 plus the experience
point cost of the highest attributes in Force, Cunning, and Wealth
they have attained. For example, a faction with Force 3, Cunning 2,
and Wealth 2 has a maximum hit point total of 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 12 hit
points. A brand-new faction with Force 1, Cunning 2, and Wealth 1 has
a maximum hit point total of 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8 hit points.

Experience points spent by factions differ from those gained by PCs in
that they are lost when they increase an attribute. Once a faction
spends 4 XP to raise Force from 2 to 3, for example, those points are
lost, and 6 more must be spent to raise Force from 3 to 4.

<a id="cunning-assets"></a>

## Cunning Assets

***<a id="orgc6f6648"></a>:*** This asset is special, and is required for
purchasing or upgrading units on a particular world. Any damage done
to a Base of Influence is also done to a faction's hit points. The
cost of a Base of Influence equals its maximum hit points, which can
be any number up to the total maximum hit points of its owning
faction. A faction's bases of influence don't count against their
maximum assets. A Base of Influence can only be purchased with the
*Expand Influence* action.

***<a id="org6899fb2"></a>:*** Selectively degrade the effectiveness of an asset. Any
attempt to attack or defend against Blackmail loses any bonus dice
earned by tags.

***<a id="orga985a53"></a>:*** Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make
cleaning them out a costly and dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special
Forces or Military Unit asset on the same planet as the Boltholes
suffers damage sufficient to destroy it, it is instead set at 0 HP and
rendered untouchable and unusable until it is repaired to full
strength. If the Boltholes are destroyed before this happens, the
asset is destroyed with them.

***<a id="org85ad0a6"></a>:*** Exhaustively cataloged psychometric records on
important and influential local figures, allowing uncanny accuracy in
predicting their actions. Once per turn, a Book of Secrets allows the
faction to reroll one die for an action taken on that world or force
an enemy faction to reroll one die. This reroll can only be forced
once per turn, no matter how many Books of Secrets are owned.

***<a id="org3924c6d"></a>:*** Quiet interstellar asset transport. Any one
Special Forces unit can be moved between any worlds within three hexes
of the Covert Shipping at the cost of one FacCred.

***<a id="org931477e"></a>:*** Facilities web an area of space with a network
of smugglers and gray-market freighter captains. As an action, any
Special Forces assets can be moved between any worlds within three
hexes of the Covert Transit Net.

***<a id="org339622f"></a>:*** A cryptographic asset for the interception and
deciphering of enemy communications. Friendly fire can be induced with
the right interference. If the Cracked Comms succeeds in defending
against an attack, it can immediately cause the attacking asset to
make an attack against itself for normal damage or counterattack
results.

***<a id="org246ee1d"></a>:*** Outfitted with the latest in personal stealth
cyberware, cyberninjas are designed to avoid all but the most careful
scans.

***<a id="org3dac9d6"></a>:*** Popular leaders of a particular faith or ideology that
can be relied upon to point their followers in the direction of
maximum utility.

***<a id="org606836a"></a>:*** This asset allows a faction to preserve more valuable
resources. If another asset on the planet suffers enough damage to
destroy it, the faction can sacrifice the false front instead to
nullify the killing blow.

***<a id="org2074f4c"></a>:*** Minions that lace a planet's underworld, watchful for
intruders. They can choose to Attack a faction without specifying a
target asset. On a successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack, all
Stealthed assets on the planet belonging to that faction are
revealed. Informers can target a faction even if none of their assets
are visible on a world; at worst, they simply learn that there are no
stealthed assets.

***<a id="orgd66588b"></a>:*** Usable to block the governmental permission that is
sometimes required to buy an asset or transport it into a system. When
a rival faction gains permission to do so, the Lobbyists can make an
immediate Cunning vs. Cunning test against the faction; if successful,
the permission is withdrawn and cannot be re-attempted until next
turn.

***<a id="org97684d7"></a>:*** These can subvert and confuse enemy assets,
striking to damage their cohesion.

***<a id="org7b2c0bb"></a>:*** These facilities weave braked AI intelligence
analysts into a web of observation capable of detecting the slightest
evidence of intruders on a world. Every rival Stealthed asset on the
planet must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning test at the beginning of
every turn or lose their Stealth. The owner also gains an additional
die on all Cunning attacks and defenses on that planet.

***<a id="orgc253889"></a>:*** Political blocks control particular cities or
regions&#x2026; blocks that are firmly in control of the faction. Each
turn, a Party Machine provides 1 FacCred to its owning faction.

***<a id="org819367f"></a>:*** A planet-wide surge of enthusiasm for a cause
controlled by the faction. This support pervades all levels of
government, and the government always grants any asset purchase or
movement requests made by the faction.

***<a id="org595c650"></a>:*** Minions rained in launching strikes against enemy
operations. An asset attacked by saboteurs cannot apply any *Use Asset
Ability* action until the start of the attacking faction's next
turn. This applies whether or not the attack was successful.

***<a id="org0f98c30"></a>:*** These asset sap a target's loyalty and will to
obey. For a cost of 1d4 FacCreds, the Seditionists can attach
themselves to an enemy asset. Until they attach to a different asset
or no longer share the same planet, the affected asset cannot
attack. If the asset is destroyed, the Seditionists survive.

***<a id="orgf928dd3"></a>:*** They and their male equivalents subvert the
leadership of enemy assets. As an action, a Seductress can travel to
any world within one hex. As an attack, a Seductress does no damage,
but an asset that has been successfully attacked immediately reveals
any other Stealthed assets of that faction on the planet. Only Special
Forces units can attack a Seductress.

***<a id="org3e0433e"></a>:*** Men and women skilled in extracting personnel. For one
FacCred, the smugglers asset can transport itself and/or any one
Special Forces unit to a planet up to two hexes away.

***<a id="org7c4effe"></a>:*** Not an asset, per se, but a special quality that can be
purchased for another Special Forces asset on the planet. An asset
that has been Stealthed cannot be detected or attacked by other
factions. If the unit normally requires the permission of a planetary
government to be moved onto a planet, that permission may be
foregone. An asset loses its Stealth if it is used to attack or
defend.

***<a id="org6789e14"></a>:*** These techniques involve selective pressure on
local routing and shipping companies. On a successful Cunning
vs. Cunning attack against a rival faction, the rival faction cannot
transport assets onto that planet without spending 1d4 FacCreds and
waiting one turn.

***<a id="org044fe08"></a>:*** Traitors can attack an enemy asset. On a successful
attack, the Treachery asset is lost, 5 FacCreds are gained, and the
targeted asset switches sides to join the traitor's faction, even if
the faction does not otherwise have the attributes necessary.

***<a id="org4d8993f"></a>:*** These observers are alert to the arrival of
stealthed units. Whenever a stealthed asset lands or is purchased on a
planet with tripwire cells, the Cells make an immediate Cunning
vs. Cunning attack against the owning faction. If successful, the
asset loses its stealth.

***<a id="org872f3ce"></a>:*** Followers of the movement are inspired
sufficiently to take up arms and fight on behalf of their leadership.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental
permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means that the
asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset
has a special feature or cost.


<a id="force-assets"></a>

## Force Assets

***[72.13](#orgc6f6648):*** These follow the standard rules for Bases of
Influence.

***<a id="org8fb4a39"></a>:*** A collection of short-range, high-capacity
spike drive ships capable of moving large numbers of troops. As an
action, the asset may move any number of assets on the planet,
including itself, to any world within one hex at a cost of one FacCred
per asset moved.

***<a id="orgb1791e9"></a>:*** A ragtag lot of corsairs, pirates, privateers,
and other deniable assets. When they successfully *Attack* an enemy
faction asset, they steal 1d4 FacCreds from the target faction as
well. This theft can occur to a faction only once per turn, no matter
how many blockade fleets attack. As an action, this asset may also
move itself to a world within one hex.

***<a id="org28f04ad"></a>:*** The pride of an empire, this is a collection of
massive capital warships without peer in most sectors. Capital fleets
are expensive to keep flying, and cost an additional 2 FacCreds of
maintenance each turn. As an action, they may move to any world within
three hexes of their current location. Planetary government permission
is required to raise a capital fleet, but not to move one into a
system.

***<a id="orgc761f0d"></a>:*** These security units specialize in code
breaking, internal security, and monitoring duties. They can crack
open enemy plots long before they have time to come to fruition.

***<a id="orgb4aa038"></a>:*** This asset covers all the myriad stratagems of war,
from induced landslides to spreading local diseases.

***<a id="orgd07d56e"></a>:*** These advanced transport ships are capable of
moving an asset long distances. As an action, any one non-Starship
asset, including itself, can be moved between any two worlds within
three hexes of the deep strike landers, at a cost of 2 FacCreds. This
movement can be done even if the local planetary government objects,
albeit doing so is usually an act of open war.

***<a id="org2582a35"></a>:*** These lightly-equipped troops are trained for
guerrilla warfare and quick raids.

***<a id="orgf05035a"></a>:*** These facilities allow for transporting assets
long distances. As an action, any one non-Starship asset, including
itself, can be moved between any two worlds within two hexes of the
extended theater, at a cost of 1 FacCred.

***<a id="org1ef061d"></a>:*** These tank formations are composed of
advanced postech gravtank units that are capable of covering almost
any terrain and cracking even the toughest defensive positions.

***<a id="orgce2d903"></a>:*** Such assets reflect popular support among the
locals and a cadre of men and women willing to fight as partisans.

***<a id="orga969df0"></a>:*** These are the employees and support staff of
the faction that have been trained in defensive fighting and equipped
with supply caches and hardened fallback positions.

***<a id="org2930c20"></a>:*** These craft allow for the transport of
resources from one world to another. As an action, any one
non-Starship asset, including this one, may be moved to any world
within one hex for one FacCred.

***<a id="org1fe8761"></a>:*** Crudely-equipped thugs and assassins with minimal training
that have been aimed at a rival faction's leadership.

***<a id="org1a3b9b2"></a>:*** A complex web of braked-AI supported sensors
and redundant security checks used to defeat attempts to infiltrate an
area. They can defend only against attacks versus Cunning, but they
add an additional die to the defender's roll.

***<a id="org4973606"></a>:*** Groups of lightly-equipped irregular troops with
rudimentary military training but no heavy support.

***<a id="org00d409d"></a>:*** Massive mag cannons and gravitic braker gun
arrays designed to defend against starship bombardments and repel
unauthorized landing. Planetary defenses can only defend against
attacks by Starship-type assets.

***<a id="org4a97295"></a>:*** The backbone of most planetary armies, these
well-trained soldiers are usually equipped with mag weaponry and
combat field uniforms, and have heavy support units attached.

***<a id="orgbb4ce7a"></a>:*** The cream of the stellar ground forces, elite
troops kitted out in the best pretech weaponry and armor available,
with sophisticated heavy support weaponry integral to the unit.

***<a id="org6ee5168"></a>:*** These assets represent caches, smugglers, or
internal research and salvage programs. As an action, a pretech
logistics asset allows the owner to buy one Force asset on that world
that requires up to tech level 5 to purchase. This asset costs half
again as many FacCreds as usual, rounded up. Only one asset can be
purchased per turn.

***<a id="org986dae7"></a>:*** Combat-trained psychics equipped with advanced
pretech stealth gear and psitech weaponry. Psychic assassins
automatically start Stealthed when purchased.

***<a id="org1367581"></a>:*** Standard civilian guards or policemen, usually
equipped with nonlethal weaponry or personal sidearms.

***<a id="orgc8c8a92"></a>:*** Heavily-armored specialist troops trained for ship
boarding actions and opposed landings. As an action, they can move to
any world within one hex of their current location, whether or not the
planetary government permits it.

***<a id="org229c458"></a>:*** Forces composed of frigate or cruiser-class vessels
equipped with space-toground weaponry and sophisticated defenses
against light planetary weaponry. As an action, they can move to any
world within one hex of their current location.

***<a id="org94fdf6e"></a>:*** Members of the faction so utterly dedicated that they are
willing to launch suicide attacks or hold positions to the death.
Zealots take 1d4 damage every time they launch a successful attack or
perform a counterattack.

## Eliminating Force Assets

It's important to remember that a disabled or damaged Force asset
hasn't necessarily been blown to pieces on a battlefield. When
thinking of ways that a conflict might have harmed such an asset,
remember that demoralization, confusion, subversion, and simple lack
of upkeep might all cripple the effectiveness of an asset, or even
destroy it as an effective force without rebuilding as expensive as
buying a fresh asset. A navy with spacemanship skills so neglected as
to constantly run ships into each other is just as worthless to its
owning faction as a fleet of smoking wrecks, and the only damage done
there was to the organization's focus.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental
permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means that the
asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset
has a special feature or cost.


<a id="wealth-assets"></a>

### Wealth Assets

***<a id="org5fe87d7"></a>:*** Once per turn, the faction can ignore one cost or
FacCred loss imposed by another faction. This does not require an
action. Multiple bank assets allow multiple losses to be ignored.

***[72.13](#orgc6f6648):*** These follow the standard rules for Bases of
Influence.

***<a id="orgc4246ca"></a>:*** These starship captains excel at transporting
goods through unfriendly lines. As an action, a blockade runner can
transfer itself or any one Military Unit or Special Forces to a world
within three hexes for a cost of two FacCreds. They can even move
units that would otherwise require planetary government permission to
enter.

***<a id="orgbc964b9"></a>:*** They substantially lessen the cost of
large-scale investments by timing materials purchases properly. As an
action, the owner of a commodities broker can roll 1d8; that many
FacCreds are subtracted from the cost of their next asset purchase,
down to a minimum of half normal price, rounded down.

***<a id="org25b035b"></a>:*** This asset reflects a deniable connection with a local
licensee for the faction's goods and services. When a Franchise
successfully attacks a enemy asset, the enemy faction loses one
FacCred (if available), which is gained by the Franchise's owner. This
loss can happen only once a turn, no matter how many Franchises
attack.

***<a id="org87f9ab5"></a>:*** A special link with heavy shipping spacers. As
an action, the faction may move any one non-Force asset, including
this one, to any world within two hexes at a cost of one FacCred.

***<a id="orga43b7e6"></a>:*** These gather the natural resources of a world, whether
ore, biologicals, or other unprocessed goods. As an action, the
Harvesters' owning faction may roll 1d6. On 3+, gain one FacCred.

***<a id="org8fcbc51"></a>:*** This asset can seize control of damaged and
poorly-controlled assets. If a Hostile Takeover does enough damage to
destroy an asset, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point and
acquired by the Hostile Takeover's owning faction.

***<a id="org756d94d"></a>:*** The lab allows a world to make hesitant progress in
tech. The presence of a Laboratory allows assets to be purchased on
that world as if it had Tech Level 4.

***<a id="org11be9f3"></a>:*** Sophists in immaculate suits or charismatic tribal
skalds, lawyers have the ability to tie an enemy up in the coils of
their own internal rules, damaging assets with confusion and red
tape. Lawyers cannot attack or counterattack Force assets.

***<a id="org395d8d9"></a>:*** These give the faction substantial influence
over the commerce on a world. Any other faction that tries to buy an
asset on that planet must pay one extra FacCred. This money is not
given to the investments' owner, but is lost. This penalty is only
applied once.

***<a id="orgebaf29e"></a>:*** Deployed to confuse enemy factions into untimely
investments. As an action, the marketers may test Cunning vs. Wealth
against a rival faction's asset. If successful, the target faction
must immediately pay half the asset's purchase cost, rounded down, or
have it become disabled and useless until this price is paid.

***<a id="orge1102d3"></a>:*** Salvage and repair damaged assets. Once between
turns, if a Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the world is
destroyed, the faction may immediately pay half its purchase cost to
restore it with one hit point. Any *Repair Asset* action taken on that
world costs one less FacCred for Special Forces and Military Units.

***<a id="org5408a79"></a>:*** Groups of well-equipped, highly-trained soldiers
willing to serve the highest bidder. Mercenaries have a maintenance
cost of one FacCred per turn. As an action, Mercenaries can move to
any world within one hex of their current location. To purchase or
move a Mercenary asset to a planet requires government permission.

***<a id="org5441ead"></a>:*** An open or tacit stranglehold on certain vital
businesses or resources on a world. As an action, owners of a monopoly
may force one other faction with unstealthed assets on that world to
pay them one FacCred. If the target faction can't pay, they lose one
asset of their choice on the world.

***<a id="org69a56a7"></a>:*** As an action, the owning faction can roll 1d6
for a Postech Industry asset. On a 1, one FacCred is lost, on a 2-4
one FacCred is earned, and a 5-6 returns two FacCreds. If money is
lost and no resources are available to pay it, the Postech Industry is
destroyed.

***<a id="org0f01786"></a>:*** Rare, precious examples of functioning
pretech industrial facilities, retrofitted to work without the benefit
of specialized psychic disciplines. As an action, the owning faction
can roll 1d8 for a Pretech Manufactory, and gain half that many
FacCreds, rounded up.

***<a id="orge567f04"></a>:*** A highly versatile team of research and
design specialists capable of supporting limited pretech&#x2026; as long as
they're adequately funded. Any world with Pretech Researchers on it is
treated as tech level 5 for the purpose of buying Cunning and Wealth
assets. Pretech researchers have a maintenance cost of 1 FacCred per
turn.

***<a id="org050beda"></a>:*** These allow the smooth extension of
wealth-creation and industrial principles to the farthest reaches of
the faction's operations. A faction with an R&D department may treat
all planets as having tech level 4 for purposes of buying Wealth
assets.

***<a id="org37efad6"></a>:*** These rag-tag armadas bring enormous technical
and mercantile resources to their patrons, along with a facility with
heavy guns. As an action, a Scavenger Fleet can be moved to any world
within three hexes. Scavenger Fleets cost 2 FacCreds a turn in
maintenance.

***<a id="org81aaef1"></a>:*** Transport large amounts of equipment and
personnel between worlds. As an action, the combine may move any
number of non-Force assets, including itself, to any world within two
hexes at a cost of one FacCred per asset.

***<a id="org0a0539c"></a>:*** Explore potential resource and investment options on
worlds. The presence of a Surveyor crew allows one additional die to
be rolled on *Expand Influence* actions. As an action, a surveyor crew
can be moved to any world within two hexes.

***<a id="org0dc8d6f"></a>:*** These facilities allow almost effortless relocation
of all assets. For one FacCred, any number of non-starship Cunning or
Wealth assets may be moved between any two worlds within three hexes
of the Transit Web. This may be done freely on the owner's turn so
long as the fee can be paid, and using the ability doesn't require an
action.

***<a id="org2e37c13"></a>:*** These bruisers don't much like scabs and management,
and they're willing to take the faction's word on which people are
which. They're lightly armed and poorly trained, but they can
infiltrate to perform sabotage.

***<a id="orgc365edd"></a>:*** This asset grows resources out of seemingly
nowhere, harvesting the best of entrepreneurship for the faction's
benefit. As an action, venture capital can be tapped. 1d8 is rolled;
on a 1, the asset is destroyed, while on a 2-3 one FacCred is gained,
4-7 yields two FacCreds and 8 grants three FacCreds.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental
permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means that the
asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset
has a special feature or cost.


<a id="faction-tags"></a>

### Faction Tags

Most factions have some unique quality about them, some trait that
distinguishes them from other factions of similar resources. Whether a
particularly fanatical band of ideological crusaders or an ancient
order of pacifistic scientists, faction tags allow a GM to give a
group a few special tricks of their own.

A faction should generally be given one tag, or two at the most for
particularly versatile organizations. The exception is the *Planetary
Government* tag, which can be acquired&#x2013; and lost&#x2013; multiple times to
reflect the faction's seizure of new worlds. Factions tags do not
normally change without some drastic and organization-shaping event.


<a id="faction-tag-colonists"></a>

### Colonists

This faction is a fresh colony on an otherwise largely untouched
planet. It is this brave band of pioneers that will tame the world's
wild forces and bring forth a better life for those who come after.

-   ***Effect:*** This faction has all the benefits of the *Planetary
    Government* tag for its homeworld, as no other government exists on
    a fresh colony. The faction's homeworld is also treated as if it had
    at least tech level 4. Colonies with fewer than 100,000 citizens
    lack the necessary industrial infrastructure to build Spaceship-type
    assets.


<a id="faction-tag-deep-rooted"></a>

### Deep Rooted

This faction has been part of a world's life for time out of mind.
Most natives can hardly imagine the world without this faction's
presence, and the traditional prerogatives and dignities of the group
are instinctively respected.

-   ***Effect:*** This faction can roll one additional d10 when defending
    against attacks on assets on their homeworld. If the faction ever
    changes homeworlds, this tag is lost.


<a id="faction-tag-eugenics-cult"></a>

### Eugenics Cult

The forbidden maltech secrets of advanced human genetic manipulation
are known to this faction, and they use them with gusto.
Slave-engineered humanoids and “deathless” leadership are just two of
the more common alterations these unstable scientists undertake.

-   ***Effect:*** Eugenics Cultists can buy the Gengineered Slaves asset;
    it's an asset requiring Force 1 with the statistics of 6 HP, 2
    FacCred cost, tech level 4 required, with an Attack of Force
    vs. Force/1d6 damage and a Counterattack of 1d4 damage. Once per
    turn, the Eugenics Cult can roll an extra d10 on an attack or
    defense by a Gengineered Slaves asset, regardless of the stat being
    used. Gengineered Slaves can count as either a Military Unit or
    Special Forces, determined when the cult first creates a specific
    asset.


<a id="faction-tag-exchange-consulate"></a>

### Exchange Consulate

This faction is either led through an Exchange Consulate or has close
ties with that pacifistic society of bankers and diplomats. The
sophisticated economic services they provide strengthen the faction.

-   ***Effect:*** When the faction successfully completes a “Peaceable
    Kingdom” Goal, they may roll 1d6; on a 4+, they gain a bonus
    experience point. Once per turn, the faction may roll an extra d10
    when defending against a Wealth attack.


<a id="faction-tag-fanatical"></a>

### Fanatical

The members of this faction just don't know when to quit. No matter
how overmatched, the members will keep fighting to the bitter end- and
occasionally past it.

-   ***Effect:*** The faction always rerolls any dice that come up
    as 1. This zealousness leaves them open at times, however; they
    always lose ties during attacks.


<a id="faction-tag-imperialists"></a>

### Imperialists

This faction nurses wild dreams of controlling the sector, whether out
of an impulse to bring their local culture and technology to less
fortunate worlds or simple lust for dominion. They excel at defeating
planetary defenses and standing armies.

This faction may roll an extra d10 for attacks made as part of a Seize
Planet action.


<a id="faction-tag-machiavellian"></a>

### Machiavellian

This faction's meat and drink is intrigue, its members delighting in
every opportunity to scheme. It may be a secret cabal of hidden
masters or the decadent court of a fallen stellar empire, but its
membership has forgotten more of treachery than most others ever
learn.

-   ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional d10
    when making a Cunning attack.


<a id="faction-tag-mercenary-group"></a>

### Mercenary Group

The faction sells its services to the highest bidder, and is an
extremely mobile organization. Vast amounts of men and material can be
moved interstellar distances in just a few months.

-   ***Effect:*** All faction assets gain the following special ability:
    As an action, the asset may move itself to any world within one hex.


<a id="faction-tag-perimeter-agency"></a>

### Perimeter Agency

This faction is or is closely tied to an Agency of the enigmatic
Perimeter organization. Originally organized by the Terran Mandate to
detect and contain maltech outbreaks until Mandate fleet resources
could be dispatched, the Perimeter retains numerous ancient override
codes for pretech security protocols.

-   ***Effect:*** Once per turn, the faction may roll an additional d10
    when making an attack against an asset that requires tech level 5 to
    purchase. The faction may roll an extra die when making a test to
    detect Stealthed assets.


<a id="faction-tag-pirates"></a>

### Pirates

This faction is a scourge of the spacelanes, driving up the cost of
shipping and terrorizing merchant captains without pity. They steal
and refit ships with vicious ingenuity, cobbling together space
armadas out of the leavings of their prey.

-   ***Effect:*** Any movement of an asset onto a world that has a Base of
    Influence for this faction costs one extra FacCred, paid to this
    faction.


<a id="faction-tag-planetary-government"></a>

### Planetary Government

This faction is the legitimate government of a planet. Rebel groups
and rival factions may have assets on the planet, but control over the
instruments of the state is firmly in this faction's hands. The
faction may rule openly, or it may simply have an inexorable grasp on
the existing authorities.

-   ***Effect:*** The faction's permission is required to buy or import
    those assets marked as needing government permission. This tag can
    be acquired multiple times, once for each planet the faction
    controls.


<a id="faction-tag-plutocratic"></a>

### Plutocratic

This faction prizes wealth, and its membership strives constantly to
expand and maintain personal fortunes. Perhaps it is a ruling council
of oligarchs or a star-spanning trade cartel.

Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional d10 when making a
Wealth attack.


<a id="faction-tag-preceptor-archive"></a>

### Preceptor Archive

This faction is or has close ties to a Preceptor Archive a place of
learning operated by the learned Preceptors of the Great
Archive. These Archives are peaceful institutions dedicated to the
spread of practical knowledge and useful engineering to the wider
cosmos. Their large numbers of educated personnel make advanced
equipment more practical for deployment.

-   ***Effect:*** Purchasing an asset that requires tech level 4 or more
    costs one fewer FacCred than normal. The Preceptor Archive may also
    take the special action “Teach Planetary Population”, costing 2
    FacCreds and allowing them to roll 1d12 for one world. On a 12, the
    world's tech level permanently becomes 4 for the purposes and
    purchases of this faction.


<a id="faction-tag-psychic-academy"></a>

### Psychic Academy

Most significant factions are capable of employing psychics, but this
faction can actually train their own. They excel at precise and
focused application of the psionic disciplines, and can get far more
out of their available psychic resources than other factions.

-   ***Effect:*** This faction can provide psionic mentor training to
    qualified psychics. Once per turn, this faction can also force a
    rival faction to reroll any one d10, whether or not they're involved
    in the roll.


<a id="faction-tag-savage"></a>

### Savage

Whether a proud tribe of neoprimitives struggling against the material
limits of their world or a pack of degenerate tomb world cannibals,
this faction is accustomed to surviving without the benefits of
advanced technology and maximizing local resources.

-   ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra die when
    defending with an asset that requires tech level 0 to purchase.


<a id="faction-tag-scavengers"></a>

### Scavengers

This faction might live within the wreckage of a tomb world, salvage
the castoffs of some decadent pleasure-world or ply the ruins of an
orbital scrapyard. Whatever their territory, this faction knows how to
find worth amid seemingly useless trash.

-   ***Effect:*** Whenever the faction destroys an asset or has one of
    their assets destroyed, they gain 1 FacCred.


<a id="faction-tag-secretive"></a>

### Secretive

This faction is marked by elaborate protocols of secrecy and
misdirection. It may be split up into numerous semi-autonomous cells,
or consist largely of trained espionage professionals. Finding the
assets of such a faction can often be more difficult than destroying
them.

All assets purchased by this faction automatically begin Stealthed.
See the list of Cunning assets for details on Stealth.


<a id="faction-tag-technical-expertise"></a>

### Technical Expertise

The faction is staffed by large numbers of expert engineers and
scientists. They can turn even the most unpromising labor pool into
superb technicians.

-   ***Effect:*** This faction treats all planets on which they have a
    [72.13](#orgc6f6648) as if they were at least tech level 4. They can
    build Starshiptype assets on any world with at least ten thousand
    occupants.


<a id="faction-tag-theocratic"></a>

### Theocratic

The faction is fueled by the fierce certainty that God is with them-
and with no one else. The tight and occasionally irrational obedience
that pervades the organization makes it difficult to infiltrate or
subvert effectively.

-   ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra d10 when
    defending against a Cunning attack.


<a id="faction-tag-warlike"></a>

### Warlike

There are factions with a military orientation, and then there are
factions that just really love killing things. Whether or not this
faction has developed sophisticated military resources and techniques,
the membership is zealous in battle and has a positive taste for
fighting.

-   ***Effect:*** Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional d10
    when making a Force attack.


<a id="factions-in-your-campaign"></a>

# Factions in Your Campaign

To create a faction, first decide on the scale of the organization.
Many factions are restricted to a single world, and even the most
impressive sector empire rarely exerts direct control over more than a
dozen worlds. Place the faction's homeworld and locate any Bases of
Influence it might have on other worlds. A few words beside each Base
describing the form it takes can be handy in later planning out
adventures with the faction.

Next, prioritize the faction's attributes, deciding the order in which
they focus on Force, Cunning, and Wealth. Minor factions should have a
4 in their most important attribute, established planetary governments
should have a 6, and regional hegemons should have an 8. Their
second-most important attribute is one less than their primary, and
their tertiary attribute is three less. You can calculate the
faction's hit points from that, but normally minor powers will have 15
HP, major powers will have 29 HP, and sector hegemons will have 49
HP. Their off-world Bases of Influence normally have a maximum HP
equal to half that.

Give minor powers one asset in their primary attribute and one asset
in a different attribute. Give major powers two assets in their
primary attribute, and two assets in different attributes, and give
regional hegemons four assets in their primary and four in others.
Place these assets on the worlds occupied by the faction.

Select an appropriate faction tag for the organization, one fitting
their special focus and origins. If the faction has direct
governmental control over one or more worlds, add Planetary Government
tags to them.

Finally, select a Goal for the faction. For your initial three or four
sector factions, try to pick goals that will put them in conflict with
each other. If the factions you make are content to hide from the
world and get along in peace and quiet, they're unlikely to be
terribly useful as patrons or enemies for the PC group, unless you
intend to enlist the PCs as defenders of some beleaguered group of
innocents.


<a id="creating-pc-factions"></a>

### Creating PC Factions

Eventually, it's likely that a PC is going to accumulate the necessary
power and influence to start their own faction. Often around 9th
level, a PC has gained enough renown and competence that others will
want to serve them, and they can choose to parlay that into a faction
of their own. This may happen at earlier levels, depending on whether
or not the PC has made it a significant priority to develop their own
faction.

Newly-founded factions are fragile, vulnerable things. They start with
a score of 2 in their primary attribute and 1 in the others, 8 hit
points, and one asset in their primary attribute. The GM may select
one faction tag appropriate to the new organization's nature.

The exact details of a PC's new faction will depend largely on what
the character did to form it.

A PC who organizes a colonial expedition to an uninhabited world will
end up with a faction very different from that of a PC that starts her
own psychic academy. In general, PCs have to actively work to create
their faction. It does not simply arrive as their natural birthright.


<a id="adventures-and-factions"></a>

### Adventures and Factions

The actions of adventurers fall outside the faction turn, but the
consequences of their escapades can translate into the loss or
acquisition of FacCreds, assets, or faction hit points. If the players
come up with a scheme to strike at the leadership of the Brotherhood
of the New Man, success or failure isn't determined according to Force
attacks or Cunning defenses. Success is determined by the outcome of
the adventure itself, and the group's ability to overcome the security
and obfuscation that surrounds these mad gengineers.

The amount of damage done or benefit given to a faction by a group's
adventures should be substantial, at least as much as could be
accomplished with a faction turn. It may not be possible to bring down
an interstellar empire by precision strikes and subversion, but the
players should be able to see concrete effects from their successes.
At the very least, the newslines at the end of each faction turn
should include public commentary on the visible consequences of their
actions.

Some players will want to take advantage of the resources of their
factions in the course of their adventures, either bringing along
troops or specialists, or utilizing faction assets on a personal
level. This should be permitted as a general matter; there's not much
fun in being a colonial governor if you can't even get a corporal's
guard of bodyguards to look after you. Faction equipment should also
be available in reasonable amounts. Subordinates are not adventurers,
however, and while they will perform their duties diligently and well,
they won't willingly take the kind of risks that adventurers often
relish. Faction assets should be an advantage and a tool for the PCs
rather than a crutch.

It may come up that a character wants to withdraw credits from his
faction, or donate loot won in the course of their adventuring.
FacCreds translate poorly into normal credits, as they often represent
resources that don't liquidate easily into cash. The GM should feel
free to prohibit directly withdrawing cash from a faction if a PC
comes to rely on it too heavily. Otherwise, one FacCred will usually
translate into about 100,000 credits worth of cash, with substantially
larger returns if used to make investments, or build things.

Characters can give up to 1d4 x 100,000 credits to a faction in any
one turn, with each 100,000 credits becoming 1 FacCred. Any more than
this in one turn is wasted due to accounting inefficiency, and the
faction will need to spend a full turn processing the donation before
it becomes FacCreds.

A GM doesn't always have time to sort out the details of every faction
that might be needed. A group might decide to attack the planetary
government of a world that wasn't important or interesting enough to
merit the effort to define its governmental faction during sector
creation, for example. The following sample factions can be pulled and
used for such places as necessary. Where appropriate, you can add the
Planetary Government tag for legitimate world governments.


<a id="example-faction-colony-world"></a>

### Colony World

Thinly-populated worlds with limited infrastructure tend to have weak
colonial governments concerned chiefly with issues of basic survival
rather than expansion or intrigue.

-   ***Hit Points:*** 15
-   ***Assets:*** Guerrilla Populace/Force 2 and Saboteurs/ Cunning 2
-   ***Tags:*** Colonists


<a id="example-faction-lost-world"></a>

### Lost World

Primitive and barbaric by the standards of the space going worlds, a lost world lacks the technical resources of their neighbors, but may well have substantial advantages in population and cultural cohesion depending on the world's habitability.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 4, Cunning 1, Wealth 3
-   ***Hit Points:*** 15
-   ***Assets:*** Zealots/Force 3, Harvesters/Wealth 1
-   ***Tags:*** Savage


<a id="example-faction-backwater-planet"></a>

### Backwater Planet

Perhaps this world was important once, but disaster, ennui, or the
Scream has left it a sleepy planet disinterested in the wider
galaxy. Most worlds with ordinary levels of technology in a sector
will fit this template.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 6, Cunning 3, Wealth 5
-   ***Hit Points:*** 29
-   ***Assets:*** Postech Infantry/Force 4, Planetary Defenses/Force 6,
    Informers/Cunning 1, Bank/ Wealth 4
-   ***Tags:*** Deep Rooted


<a id="example-faction-zealous-faith"></a>

### Zealous Faith

This religious organization is a powerful force in the sector, likely
with major congregations on several worlds.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
-   ***Hit Points:*** 29
-   ***Assets:*** Demagogue/Cunning 6, Organization Moles/Cunning 5,
    Zealots/Force 3, Marketers/Wealth 5
-   ***Tags:*** Theocratic


<a id="example-faction-regional-hegemon"></a>

### Regional Hegemon

This world is the mightiest military power in the sector and leads a
half-dozen neighboring worlds in a “voluntary confederation” that it
ever seeks to expand.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 8, Cunning 5, Wealth 7
-   ***Hit Points:*** 49
-   ***Assets:*** Space Marines/Force 7, Planetary Defenses/ Force 6,
    Blockade Fleet/Force 5, Extended Theater/Force 4, Pretech
    Manufactory/Wealth 7, Shipping Combine/Wealth 4, Tripwire
    Cells/Cunning 4, Cyberninjas/Cunning 3
-   ***Tags:*** Imperialists


<a id="example-faction-mercantile-combine"></a>

### Mercantile Combine

A star-spanning consortium of merchants might operate out of one
particular world, but their final loyalty is always to their credit
balance.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 5, Wealth 6
-   ***Hit Points:*** 29
-   ***Assets:*** Venture Capital/Wealth 6, Shipping Combine/Wealth 4,
    Hardened Personnel/Forces 2, Blackmail/Cunning 2
-   ***Tags:*** Plutocratic


<a id="example-faction-eugenics-cult"></a>

### Eugenics Cult

Some people are born to rule- literally. These eugenics cults believe
that superior breeds of humanity can be successfully engineered, and
that good genetic background legitimizes rule over less “advanced”
humans.

Such cults are widely loathed, but the experimental medical treatment
they offer to those who can find them makes unwilling converts of
some.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
-   ***Hit Points:*** 29
-   ***Assets:*** Boltholes/Cunning 5, Demagogue/Cunning 6,
    Laboratory/Wealth 3, Gengineered Slaves/Force 1
-   ***Tags:*** Eugenics Cult


<a id="example-faction-rebel-freedom-fighters"></a>

### Rebel Freedom Fighters

Even in the most tyrannical corners of the galaxy, the human heart
yearns for freedom. These factions spring up in the shadow of
oppressive governments. For each one that is crushed, a new one rises
in time.

-   ***Attributes:*** Force 3, Cunning 4, Wealth 1
-   ***Hit Points:*** 15
-   ***Assets:*** Seditionists/Cunning 4, Zealots/Force 3
-   ***Tags:*** Secretive


<a id="an-example-of-faction-play"></a>

### An Example of Faction Play

The GM has just finished brewing up her initial sector. She has a
rough sketch of the worlds, she's fleshed out the planet where the
initial play session will occur, and she's ready to run the game. She
thinks it'd be nice to have some background activity going on, so she
plans to create three factions to decorate her world.

She picks out three groups that are likely to be significant players
in this corner of her sector: the harsh planetary government of
Typhon, the initial starting point for the game, the Rathskeller
Combine, a multistellar megacorp based off the world of Danube in the
neighboring solar system, and the Way of Voth, a pretech-worshiping
cult with a hidden base on Singularity, a gas giant moon in a system
neighboring both.

These aren't the only possible factions in the system, of course, but
they're the ones most likely to be pertinent to PC interests. If the
PCs move on, she might retire some of these factions to bring in new
ones. She knows she shouldn't have more than a half-dozen factions
active at once unless she's ready to do a lot of tracking during each
faction turn.

She knows the Typhon government is a fairly powerful faction, having
effective control of its home planet save for some plucky rebels
against its autocratic monarchy. Force is its strongest tool, so she
gives it a rating of 6 in that, followed by Wealth of 5 and Cunning
of 3. Its maximum hit points are 29. As a major power, it has two
Force assets and two more assets of any kind. Typhon would love to
have Pretech Infantry and has the Force score to support it, but its
tech level is 4, too low for such advanced troops. It settles for a
Strike Fleet and some Postech Infantry. Aside from that, it has a
government Monopoly on spike drive components and a Postech Industry
that helps make them. It also has a [72.13](#orgc6f6648) on its home
world of Typhon that automatically has 29 hit points, the same as the
faction itself. Finally, it has the faction tag of Planetary
Government, because it's the legitimate ruler of Typhon.

For the Rathskeller Combine, the GM decides that it's about as
powerful as the Typhon government due to its far-flung mercantile
connections. On reflection, she thinks its main money comes from its
control of the ship-building industry outside the Typhon system, which
makes it an economic competitor with the state-run Typhon
shipyards. She gives it a Wealth rating of 6, Force of 5, and Cunning
of 3, with a maximum HP of 29. Since it's starship-centric, she gives
it Shipping Combine and Blockade Runner assets for Wealth, and other
assets of Elite Skirmishers and Saboteurs. The Plutocratic tag fits
its mercantile origins.

For the final faction, the GM decides to make them a relatively weak
group, one that tries to use its limited supplies of pretech artifacts
to manipulate “less developed” societies. She gives it a Cunning score
of 4, a Wealth of 3, and a Force of 1. Its maximum hit points
are 15. It gets only two assets as a minor power, so goes with
Cyberninjas and Covert Shipping to get those ninjas where they need to
go. The GM mulls over the faction tags, but none seem to be quite
right. She decides to give it her own tag of “Pretech Stores”, letting
it treat Singularity as a tech level 5 world for purposes of buying
high-tech assets there. While there's no other meaningful authority on
the gas giant moon, the GM doesn't think it's proper to give them the
Planetary Government tag because there really isn't anything else *on*
Singularity except the Vothite base. They don't have the implicit
military power to prevent hostile military assets from landing on the
world, so they don't really fit the mold of the Planetary Government
tag.

The last step in creating the factions is to give each of them an
initial goal. She decides that the Rathskeller Combine is really
interested in breaking into Typhon's closed market. She gives it the
*Expand Influence* goal, which rewards it when it can found a Base of
Influence on another planet. Typhon is a violent, expansionistic power
that goes in for *Blood the Enemy*, so it seeks to inflict hit point
damage on rival assets equal to the sum of its attributes, or 14
points. The Vothites know they can't survive a direct confrontation
with either important power, so they want to get ready to make a move
when they're stronger; they choose *Peaceable Kingdom*, needing to
spend four consecutive turns without taking an *Attack* action.

With this established, the GM is ready to run the first faction turn.


<a id="turn-one"></a>

### Turn One

The GM randomly selects the Rathskeller Combine to go first, followed
by Typhon, and then the Vothites.

First, the Combine earns its income for the turn; half its Wealth plus a
quarter of its total Force and Cunning, rounded down. That means 5
FacCreds.

Next, it pays maintenance. It has no assets that require maintenance
and hasn't got more assets of any one type than its corresponding
attribute, so it has no maintenance cost. If it were to accumulate
four Cunning assets, however, while only having a Cunning of 3, it
would have to pay one FacCred for each over the limit. Bases of
Influence don't count for this purpose.

Now the Combine has to decide what action to take. It knows that
Typhon is itching for a fight. The Combine is nervous about their
rival's Strike Fleet, but that seems to be the only force that
immediately threatens them. The Postech Infantry that Typhon has
doesn't have any practical way to cross into Danubian space unless
Typhon buys some sort of transport asset. Right now there seems no way
for the Typhonians to do that, so the Combine decides to go for a long
economic game, taking the *Buy Asset* action to spend 2 FacCreds on
Harvesters. The GM decides that this represents a new flotilla of
asteroid mining tugs. A faction can buy only one asset per turn and
can take only one action, so the Combine's turn is over.

Typhon isn't wasting any time. It gets its FacCred income for the turn
of 4 FacCreds and uses its action to *Use Asset Ability* to let its
Strike Fleet enter the Danube system. Some assets require governmental
permission to move them into a system with an existing government, but
not Strike Fleets. They tend to make their own permission. Typhon
would like to start attacking Combine assets, but it can only take one
action per turn, so it will have to wait until the next one to open
fire.

The Vothites are keeping their head down, accruing their 2 FacCreds.
As poor as they are, they need to do something about it, so they
invest in a *Buy Asset* action to get a Harvester. The GM decides that
it represents scavenger teams dispatched to loot vital resources from
the dangerous pretech caches hidden on Singularity.

As the final step, the GM translates these faction actions into
newsfeed stories to share with the PCs. She scribbles up short news
blasts about “Typhon First Fleet Dispatched to Suppress Piracy in the
Danube System”, “Rathskeller Combine Commissions New Wing of Asteroid
Miners”, and “Unusual Ship Traffic In Singularity System”. These
stories may not have the whole truth about affairs, but they're what
the PCs would find out from the local news organizations.


<a id="turn-two"></a>

### Turn Two

The PCs completed their first adventure and are busy swanning around
in the Danube system. Nothing they've done directly impinges on the
local factions, so the GM simply runs the next faction turn after the
session is over. Random rolls give Voth the first action, then Typhon,
and then the Combine.

Voth gets another 2 FacCreds and dutifully uses *Buy Asset* to get
another Harvester, scaling up their salvage efforts. This makes two
Wealth assets that Voth has; it can get one more Wealth asset before
it starts to have to pay maintenance on any additional ones. They
would've liked to have used *Use An Asset* to see if their existing
Harvester made them any money, but they can't take two different
actions during the same turn, so they must wait for now.

Typhon now collects its 4 FacCreds, for a total of 8, and uses the
*Attack* action. If it had multiple assets in position, it could
attack with all of them; as it stands, only the Strike Fleet is in the
same location as a rival power. It aims at the [72.13](#orgc6f6648), but
the Combine gets to decide which asset the Strike Fleet engages. It
chooses to defend with its Blockade Runners. The Strike Fleet's Attack
is Force versus Force, so Typhon rolls 1d10 and adds its Force rating
for a score of 11. Against this, the Combine rolls 1d10 and adds its
own Force rating for a score of 12. The Strike Fleet's attack has
failed, and it takes the Counterattack damage of the Blockade Runners,
for 2d4 damage, for 7 points. The Strike Fleet is now down to 1 hit
point.

The Rathskeller Combine now senses an opportunity. They collect their
income of 5 FacCreds for a total of 8 and take an Attack action of
their own, ordering the Saboteurs to press the attack. The Strike
Fleet is the only viable target in the sector, so Typhon is forced to
defend with it. The Saboteurs' attack is Cunning versus Cunning. The
Combine rolls an 8, a tepid result, while the Strike Fleet gets lucky
and rolls a 9. The Saboteurs are forced to take the Strike Fleet's
counterattack damage of 1d8, and roll a 6; they are wiped out. Stung,
the Combine throws the Elite Skirmishers into the fray, the only other
asset they have that even has an attack. They roll a Force vs. Force
attack, Typhon rolls badly, and the Strike Fleet is destroyed.

The GM then writes up the news blasts for the session, describing how
“pirate” boarding parties destroyed the Typhonian strike fleet by
taking advantage of security breaches caused by recently-discovered
saboteurs. She decides that both Danube and Typhon want to avoid
outright war, and that Danube's planetary government won't get
involved so long as Typhon is only cutting down Combine holdings.


<a id="turn-three"></a>

### Turn Three

As it turns out, the PCs took notice of that news item about
Singularity's ship activity and decided to investigate. In the course
of their adventure they killed a Vothite salvage crew and snatched
away a precious haul of pretech artifacts that the crew had been
recovering. The GM decides that this costs the Vothites one of their
two Harvester assets. There is no die roll or faction action related
to this; the PCs did it, so it simply happens. They also left plenty
of evidence, so the GM makes a note to have a Vothite cyberninja come
after them and their stolen artifacts. Such small-scale actions
related to PC adventures don't require a full faction action, so the
Vothites don't need to use an Attack action to go after the
troublesome PCs.

The Vothites go first this round and are not amused. They collect
their 2 FacCreds and Use An Ability to see if their remaining
Harvester makes them any money; they roll a 4 on its ability and gain
an extra FacCred, for a total of 3 in its coffers this turn.

Typhon goes next, collecting 4 FacCreds for a total of 12. It's
licking its wounds, but at least it managed to inflict 6 of the
necessary 14 points of damage on a foe to succeed at its *Blood the
Enemy* goal. It uses *Buy Asset* to buy a new Strike Fleet,
reconstituting it from the survivors and spending all 12 FacCreds on
it.

The Combine goes last, and is at a crossroads. Their income this turn
gives them 13 FacCreds and they've successfully destroyed a Typhionian
Strike Fleet, but it cost them their Saboteurs, and they have only one
asset left that can even attack at all. What should they do to address
the Typhonian menace? Maybe some PC mercenaries might tip the scales
for them&#x2026;

# GAME MASTER RESOURCES

The following pages include a number of tables for the quick
generation of NPCs, patrons, names, place names, and quick
encounters. The tables are in no way intended to be exhaustive or
particularly detailed. They are simply quick conveniences for the GM
to spare constant reference to the internet or other books to nail
down the basic flavoring of their NPCs.

Aside from these tables, this section also discusses some of the more
common issues that arise for GMs of ***Stars Without Number***. PC
death, the role of combat, when to use skill checks, how to handle
investigations, and other potentially sticky elements are reviewed and
advice given for the practical handling of these matters.

In addition, this chapter gives some guidelines on converting material
from the first edition of the game to the current revised rules. A
selection of potential house rules are also suggested for groups that
wish to customize their game a little more.

When applying any of these guidelines or suggestions, however, it is
important that you remember a critical thing about running the game at
your table.


<a id="your-game-and-your-group"></a>

## Your Game and Your Group

The most important thing you can remember as a GM running ***Stars
Without Number*** is that you are running it for a *specific group of
people*. You are not running it for a generic Typical Gamer, you are
running it for Bob and Eunice and Feng and Tyler. There is no
genericized advice that can be applied to your specific group that is
nearly as helpful as your own powers of social expertise and your
personal knowledge of the table.

Game designers sometimes fall into the trap of trying to force social
outcomes at the table through specific game rules. These rules can
encourage certain outcomes in the general case, but they cannot compel
results. They are certainly not nearly as effective in producing an
outcome as you, the GM, can be, because these rules can't know your
players as well as you do.

Whenever you consider making a house rule, or adding a tweak to the
game, or even basic considerations of what kind of sandbox excitement
you should be offering to your players, you must always think about
the specific players you have. Don't worry about the Typical
Gamer. The Typical Gamer is not at your table. If Bob really wants a
new focus that allows his PC to do a particular trick, you do not need
to think of all the ways a Typical Gamer could abuse or misuse that
new power. You need to think of the ways *Bob* could misuse it. Maybe
he is the kind of gamer who would be very disruptive to the game with
the ability, and maybe you know how he plays well enough to tell that
he'd never cause a problem with it. The same ability that would be
absolutely terrible in the hands of some players can be perfectly safe
in the hands of others. Only you can reasonably tell which is which.

The same general attitude is necessary towards other elements of your
campaign, not just the house rules. You need to think about how your
specific players are likely to react to plot hooks, campaign elements,
and new additions to the game. If you know Eunice was bored out of her
mind by an adventure session that revolved around trading, it's
probably a bad idea to offer her hooks that focus on commercial
dealings, or at least talk it over with her outside the game before
you introduce it to make sure there's something about the hook that
she can find engaging.

As the GM, you already have a lot of responsibility on your
shoulders. You have the adventures to create, the sandbox to populate,
and the game itself to run. It is very unlikely that you have the
energy or the time to worry about creating universally-functional
house rules and generalized systems. That is the game designer's
job. It's up to me to give you general rules that will work well in
most situations and provide serviceable results with the Typical
Gamer. That kind of averaged-out design is necessary if you're to be
provided with a basic toolbox of useful mechanics and systems.

But you can do better, because you know your audience. You know what
they want, what they're interested in, and how they're likely to use
the tools you hand them. You can create specific house rules and
case-by-case permissions that mold your game to fit the needs and
interests of your own table.

***Stars Without Number*** is designed in the spirit of oldschool
gaming, where these sort of house rules and campaign-specific systems
are totally acceptable and perfectly normal. This game is not a
delicate flower that will wilt if you touch it the wrong way. It is
built on a basic mechanical chassis more than forty years old, a
veritable AK-47 of game design, and it can take an incredible amount
of punishment and careless handling without breaking. You will not
ruin your game by adding in house rules that make sense to you.

This game belongs to you and your players. As the designer, I only get
a vote in how things should be; the ultimate decision is always with
you and your play group. Only you properly understand the goals of
your group and the kind of fun you want to have, and only you and your
players can provide the definitive understanding of your ultimate
aim. I am providing you with a basic structure that will work for most
groups, but it's up to you to add the chrome or tweaks that you want.

Perhaps you won't need to add any. It may well be that the rules
exactly as written serve your purpose just fine, and you have no
particular desire to tweak them. If that's the case, then that's
fine. But you should never be afraid to reach in and adjust things to
improve your own play. Add systems from other old-school-inspired
games, brew up your own rules, or excise bits that don't fit. This
game is yours, and you should play it *your* way.


<a id="common-complications"></a>

## Common Game Master Complications

Once you've successfully created your sector and gathered the players,
you might find a few difficulties cropping up in the course of
play. There are certain pitfalls and complications that are particular
to the style of play that ***Stars Without Number*** encourages, and
it's helpful to have an idea beforehand of how to deal with them.


<a id="death"></a>

## Death

Characters in ***Stars Without Number*** die easily. The average
third-level psychic might well be taken out by a lucky pistol round,
and even high-level warriors don't have more than 60 or 70 hit
points. It's true that biopsionics and lazarus patches can revive
characters that get medical help in time, but there are plenty of
situations where there's just not time to save a teammate or the
attempt proves a failure. If the rules are used as written, PCs who
regularly put themselves in dangerous situations are going to die.

You and your players should decide at the start of the game how you
want to deal with this. For maximum old-school authenticity, you might
mutually decide to just let the dice fall where they may. If Captain
Spaulding plunges into the sulfur volcanoes of Badghati IV, the
high-level veteran of dozens of daring interstellar escapades gets a
touching space memorial and his player rolls up a replacement. This is
the default assumption of the game, and it can add a great deal of
excitement and reward to the sensation of navigating a character
through lethal challenges.

It can also really aggravate players who enjoy building
deeply-involved PCs with many close ties to the game world and its
characters. A GM can decide to omit the risk of death in most cases,
reducing PCs with 0 hit points to “gravely wounded” status and
allowing them to be revived with medical attention. Some situations
might run the risk of real death, but the GM can save this for
occasions of genuine dramatic importance. There's nothing at all wrong
with this approach to death, and it can help some players focus on the
story that they and their group are creating rather than living in
fear of every goon with a combat rifle.

Of course, there are shades of gray between these two extremes, and
most GMs come to inhabit some point on this spectrum. There are many
ways the GM can lessen the risk of death without out-and-out denying
it. In particular, the GM can cause enemies to spread their attacks
over a group rather than focusing on the weakest PC. Hostiles can pay
more attention to the warriors in the group rather than the experts or
psychics, especially when the Warrior has yet to use his class ability
to negate a hit. You can take care not to include instant-death traps
or devices in your adventures, or fabricate situations where a
character's life hinges on a single die roll. You can include
substantial numbers of NPC henchmen and companions in an adventure,
and let them soak up a portion of the danger. All of these tactics can
be used to tacitly lessen the danger of character death without taking
it off the table.

Sooner or later, however, it's likely that some PC is going to kick
the bucket. At that point, it becomes necessary to get a replacement
into the action. The replacement PC should be added as quickly as
possible, and it can often be advantageous for players to roll up
these replacements before the game even starts, so they have a
character in hand should their former PC catch a bad case of laser
poisoning. Creating the characters beforehand also allows the group to
set up ties of association that help justify why they're suddenly
willing to include the new PC in their adventures. These replacements
can be members of the crew of the ship they're travelling on,
outworlders slouching around the local bars, wanderers gone native
among the locals, or prisoners of whatever nefarious group the party
is fighting. The key factor is to get the replacement into action
quickly, so the player who's lost his or her PC isn't punished with
inactivity at the table as well as PC loss.

It's generally easiest to have the replacement PC be the same level as
the dead PC. For high-level adventures, it's distressingly likely that
a low-level PC would die quickly when facing challenges of that
caliber. If they do come in at a lower level, you're going to have to
make some allowances when it comes time for them to gain experience
points. If everyone is gaining points at the same rate, the
lower-level PC will never catch up; you may want to give them a bonus
after each adventure to ensure that eventually they match the same
level of competence as the rest of the crew.


<a id="skill-checks-3"></a>

## Skill Checks

Skill checks are susceptible to overuse. Some GMs end up forcing a
skill check on everything more complicated than tying your bootlaces,
or prohibit PCs from even hoping to accomplish a feat for which they
lack the appropriate skill. Skill checks are not meant to be the sole
way that a PC gets something accomplished in the world.

You should be charitable about the things a character can accomplish
without a skill check. If an Expert's concept is that of a crack
spaceship pilot with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and Pilot-2 skill, you
shouldn't be expecting him to make skill checks to operate the ship
under normal conditions. He can take off, he can land, he can get to
places in the system without bothering with skill checks. Even someone
with Pilot-0 should likely be able to do as much, except the expert
pilot can do it without a check even amid high winds and low
visibility. Let the PCs be good at their chosen focus.

Don't spam skill checks. If a character is trying to repair a fusion
power plant while under fire from badlands raiders, don't turn it into
a roll-each-turn extravaganza to determine how far he progresses in
his attempt. Let him roll once, with a failure meaning either that he
can't do it in the available time or that he'll need another 1d6
rounds before he can bring the defense laser power plant online. Give
him player choices each turn, like deciding whether to bring a laser
online early and risk a short in the wiring. Let a single skill check
indicate the general course of success or failure, but then let the PC
make additional choices rather than additional rolls. Rolls can only
add so much tension, and tension alone does not guarantee engagement
with a situation.

Don't require a skill check unless failing it means something. If a
character can simply keep trying at something with no real negative
consequences, it's not worth a skill check. They'll get it sooner or
later, so it's easiest to just tell them that it was successful. If
time is important and there's a significant difference between
accomplishing it instantly or accomplishing it soon, just follow a
failed skill check with a roll of 1d6 and assume that many rounds,
minutes, or hours go by before the PC finally gets it right.

Don't ignore actions taken outside of skill checks. If a character
jams a titanium wrecking bar into the cogs of an alien death trap, you
probably shouldn't require him to make a successful Fix roll to
disable the device. What he's done will objectively work, and there's
no point or need in rolling for it. If there's a casket of luminous
Mettauan glass underneath the senator's bed, then the players will
find it if they look under the bed, and no Notice check is needed to
see if they notice it. Skill checks are best used to reflect the
results of a complicated or uncertain attempt at an action. If the PC
tries something that anyone can do and that would have an obvious
result, then just let the result happen. Don't use a skill check
unless the outcome is unclear.


<a id="combat-1"></a>

## Combat

Combat in ***Stars Without Number*** tends to be fairly lethal. One good
roll by a pistol-wielding thug can take out almost any first level
character, and characters never really scale to the point where they
can afford to hold enemies in contempt. You should take care to
structure your adventures and situations so that PCs are very rarely
forced into fights. The shotguns and laser rifles should come out
either because the PCs have chosen to use them or because they're
facing the consequences of their own missteps.

Because combat is so dangerous, it's vital to allow the PCs to set it
up on their own terms, assuming they're cunning and prudent enough to
take advantage of their opportunities. Ambushes, AC bonuses for cover,
and the use of the environment to hurt and baffle their foes should
all be encouraged. If a character wants to use an element of the
environment to do something interesting, let them. “You do that, and
nothing happens.” is rarely a good answer for any halfway plausible PC
action.

Enemies should also be played as their morale indicates. A pack of
street thugs will not transform into Spartans at Thermopylae, dying to
the last man to prevent the PCs from discovering their gang
hideout. Even trained and disciplined combatants are going to have
serious thoughts about retreat as soon as their comrades start
dying. Only when enemies feel trapped or are defending something as
precious to them as their lives will they normally fight to the last.


<a id="negotiation-and-diplomacy"></a>

## Negotiation and Diplomacy

There is a Talk skill, and the fact that this and similar social
skills exist sometimes causes players or GMs to simply shut off more
informal evaluations of social situations. When the PC wants to
convince an NPC of something, they roll Cha/Talk and let the dice tell
them how far the NPC is willing to buy their premise. The actual words
and arguments they use are simply decorations to the event.

On one level, this is justifiable. The player of the Warrior isn't
expected to be a real-life shootist to roll a good attack roll, so why
should the player of the silver-tongued Expert con man have to come up
with a smooth line of patter to use his own abilities? It's legitimate
and reasonable to let the dice determine the success of a
conversational gambit. If a player has spent character resources on
something like social skills, they should see a mechanical benefit
from it. Moreover, relying on a player's conversational talents to
move negotiations can often boil down to a game of finding the right
conversational gambit for the GM rather than rationally persuading the
NPC.

Still, some players and GMs prefer to let actual argumentation play a
bigger role. One potential way to do this is to let the player state
his or her case, and then set the Talk check difficulty
accordingly. Convincing a crime boss to give a PC access to his
network of corrupt city officials might be a difficulty 8 test if the
player makes a good argument for it, while a desultory request might
be difficulty 10. Alternately, you might implicitly adjust the
consequences of success or failure based on the character's total
Charisma and skill bonus. A character with a +5 total might not
succeed in persuading the crime boss if they roll very low, but he'll
point them towards someone who might be able to help them. The key for
this sort of approach is to let both skills and player argumentation
have a visible effect on the outcome, so that players feel that both
matter.

In either case, you should make clear to the group which model will be
used when they're making up their characters. It prevents difficulty
later when the player running the character with a -1 Charisma
modifier and no social skills expects his own glib tongue to carry the
day with NPCs.


<a id="searching-and-investigation"></a>

## Searching and Investigation

Many adventures rely on the party solving a mystery or unearthing the
dark truths behind some enigmatic event. PCs can occasionally get
frustrated by these adventures when they feel that they've hit a dead
end or are presented with a set of clues that they, the players, can't
hope to puzzle out. Conversely, players can sometimes grow bored when
the adventures become a sequence of skill tests, with the PCs simply
trying to roll high so that the GM will let them advance.

Running a good investigation-based adventure can be difficult, but
there are a few tactics that can be useful to a GM. First, identify
those pieces of information that must be found in order to solve the
puzzle. Cracking the secret organlegging ring run out of the city's
child protective services department might hinge on identifying the
secret lab in which the organs are harvested, the corrupt CPS chief
who hides the goods in her home, and the crooked physician who
launders the organs into the donor system. These three facts have to
be discovered in order for the PCs to progress.

Once you've established the facts, watch for opportunities to let them
be discovered. Drawn in by the hook of a recurring urchin NPC they
knew who vanished after being picked up by protective services, the
PCs might check out the NPC's old haunts or associates, only to learn
that a number of street kids have gone missing after CPS collected
them, and that all of them were picked up by a particular agent. Don't
make the discovery of vital information hinge on a die roll. If the
PCs take rational investigative steps, they should be given something
to show for it, even if it's just the confidence that their current
route is a dead end. You should be *trying* to give out this
information when the PCs give you an excuse to do so, rather than
hoarding it against all but precisely correct lines of investigation.

You also shouldn't feel bad about giving PCs a break if they start to
flail, either by introducing a helpful NPC to put them back on the
trail or remind them of some earlier point they didn't fully
investigate. By the same token, you shouldn't hesitate to let them
deal with the consequences of tardiness. If they spend too long in
distractions before finding their urchin friend, they might discover
nothing more than spare parts.

One particular point that often comes up is the question of searching
an area. Some GMs just let the PCs all make Notice checks to see if
they notice something hidden. This has the advantage of being quick
and simple, but it also can put vital information at the mercy of good
dice. Other GMs require the players to specifically say what parts of
an area they're searching, what they're looking under or inside, and
otherwise describe the specifics of their search. This can penalize
players who don't correctly envision the area the GM is
describing. One compromise is to simply give players vital clues when
they say that they are searching, and then use one or both of the
other methods to let them search for supplementary facts and helpful
details.


<a id="salvage"></a>

## Salvage

The far future is full of expensive decor. Truly enterprising PCs
sometimes are of a mind to “salvage” a place down to its foundations,
ripping out everything that can be resold and trucking it all off to
be converted into credits. To some extent, this is simply common
sense; no red-blooded freebooter would simply leave unclaimed
valuables lying around when he knows they'll fetch a good price at the
starport. Still, it can be tedious to handle the logistics of salvage
and unbalancing to the game to allow PCs to cash in on every alien
fork and wall panel they can drag back to civilization.

The easiest way to deal with this is to simply make clear that most
non-portable valuables the PCs might salvage are just too difficult to
move on the secondary market. Questions of legal ownership, finding a
suitably indiscriminate buyer, and avoiding tax scrutiny all combine
to make such efforts more trouble than they're worth. It can be
interesting to make an adventure out of moving some particularly
exceptional piece of salvage, but as a general rule, it's just not
worth it to strip the copper wiring out of a crime boss' hideout.

There is also the issue of PCs methodically stripping the armor,
weapons, and pocket change from their dead foes. In most cases this is
self-limiting, as most PCs can't easily pack around a half-dozen
combat rifles while engaged in the kind of pursuits that leave them
fighting their former owners. In the unlikely case that the PCs come
back with a cargo sled, most of the armor is probably worthless due to
the perforations that killed its wearer and the weaponry is unlikely
to be so valuable as to unbalance the game. Even in that case, moving
the weapons on the black market is usually not a trivial
enterprise. You shouldn't discourage PCs from upgrading their own
equipment from the plunder of the fallen or taking exceptionally
valuable pieces for later fencing, but you shouldn't feel obligated to
let them decamp with the battlefield on their backs.

The actual mechanics of selling plunder can be as complicated as you
wish to make them. It may be that what the PCs retrieve can be sold
openly on the world, usually for around half its purchase value if a
quick sale is desired. Something closer to full price can only be
obtained with the sort of patience, contacts, and attention that
adventurers rarely have avaialble.

A fence might be needed for those goods which were acquired in illicit
fashion, or items that are outlawed for common trade. Fences rarely
pay more than ten or twenty percent of an item's purchase price. Many
such difficulties can be removed by taking the loot offworld and
laundering it somewhere beyond the reach of the planet's laws.


<a id="interstellar-trade"></a>

## Interstellar Trade

As an extension of this, some groups will want to make a killing in
interstellar trade, carrying the goods of one world to another to make
a fast credit. This is a venerable science-fiction trope, and there's
no reason you shouldn't allow it, but there are a few considerations
to keep in mind when dealing with space commerce.

Perhaps most importantly, there is no such thing as interstellar bulk
shipping in ***Stars Without Number***. Even the largest spike drive
ships have cargo capacities measured in a few tens of thousands of
tons, while a modern oil tanker has a capacity of around 500,000
tons. Trying to run a meaningful trade in bulk commodities has been a
lost cause ever since the jump gates failed and massive system-ship
freighters could no longer make the jump between worlds. Such commerce
can exist inside a system, with huge slowboats moving from planet to
planet, but modern trade relies on carrying small loads of high-value
goods or expert services.

Most small merchant ships such as the ones a PC group is likely to own
rely on in-system supply runs as their bread and butter. They cart
loads of food, water, replacement personnel, spare parts, and other
life support supplies out to remote asteroid mines, research stations,
and extraction plants. The pay is rarely much, but such supply run
missions are excellent hooks for dropping a group into the middle of
some disaster.

Trade beyond supply runs usually revolves around moving local
specialty tech or products. Local art, exotic pharmaceuticals,
high-quality technical specialties, or passengers with special skills
who want to reach a particular world all make up this class of
trade. For most purposes, it's not necessary to really elaborate on
the specifics of this, though it can add flavor to make up a product
or two unique to a given world.

There are also exceptionally risky trading expeditions to
lostworlders, bringing the fruits of modern postech to their benighted
nations. While the weaponry, pharmaceuticals, and technical artifacts
are usually greedily desired on these worlds, the natives often have
very little of value to pay for them. Explorer-merchants often have to
investigate a lostworlder culture carefully before they can identify
any particular product or resource that can be usefully shipped
interstellar distances to justify the trip. Some particularly
unscrupulous merchants do not balk at taking payment in local slaves
for export to decadent or dangerous worlds.

There are also “missionary” supply runs to these primitive worlds. The
Preceptors of the Great Archive occasionally run missions on a planet
to disseminate valuable technical and artistic knowledge among the
locals, and there are always a selection of determined missionaries
bent on bringing the word of their faith to the heathens. While these
missions normally can supply their own food, offworld medicine and
spares are vital for keeping their more advanced tech operating.

More sinister than the Preceptors and the pious are the “Kurtzes”. The
prospect of ruling like a god on some forgotten world lures a certain
type of men and women, a type that might normally be forced to limit
their dark ambitions on a more technically advanced world, where
energy weapons and powered armor do not give a person so vast an
advantage over their peers. These Kurtzes seek out lost worlds with
other like-minded men and women, usually framing their ambitions as a
matter of “bringing advancement to the primitives”. Most Kurtz
expeditions collapse in blood and horror within a few years, but some
manage to hold on for far longer.


<a id="quick-trade-rules"></a>

## Quick Trade Rules

For those who prefer not to use the full-fledged rules for
interstellar trade provided in the ***Suns of Gold*** supplement, here
are a few quick guidelines for responding to player interest in
interstellar trade. They assume the PCs have a ship, but are just
scrounging for marginal shipments and fast opportunities rather than
taking advantage of a formal trade network and steady, reliable work
contracts.

First, let the PCs find a deal for some good that the planet might
reasonably produce. Cheap bulk goods would run for 2d6 x 10 credits
per ton, ordinary finished goods go for 2d6 x 100 credits per ton, and
high-tech, expensive products are 2d6 x 1,000 credits per ton. They
can find a new deal with a week's wait.

PCs can try to improve the purchase price with a Cha/Trade skill check
opposed by the seller's Wis/

Trade skill roll. On a success, the price decreases by 10% times the
level of Trade skill the bargainer has. On a failure, the price
remains firm.

Before the goods are loaded, roll 1d6. If the PCs tried to get a
better price, subtract 1 from the roll. If the result is 1 or less,
something has gone wrong and the goods are lost, stolen, confiscated,
or fake. The PCs are going to have to either eat the loss or take
whatever adventurous steps are necessary to get their money or goods
back. These steps may involve gunfire.

When the PCs try to sell the goods, assuming the planet might
reasonably want them, roll 2d6+1 and multiply it by 10 for bulk goods,
100 for finished manufactures, or 1,000 for expensive goods. This is
the base price the buyer offers to the PCs. They can bargain for
better with the same opposed check as before, gaining a 10% price
increase per Trade skill level on a success. On a failure, the PCs
have to accept the offered price.

After the sale is finalized, the 1d6 needs to be rolled again, also
with a -1 penalty if a better price was sought. On a result of 1 or
less, the sale end of things goes awry, and the PCs are out both money
and goods. To salvage them, they'll need to conduct some sort of
adventure revolving around reclaiming their rightful due.


<a id="converting-first-edition"></a>

## Converting First Edition Stars Without Number

Most of this edition's content can be used interchangeably with first
edition ***Stars Without Number***. Characters may be created somewhat
differently, starships might handle combat in a new way, and psionics
might have changed, but the end result largely uses the same
statistics and same score ranges. An original-edition ***Stars Without
Number*** character can adventure in a revised-edition campaign without
requiring much in the way of special rules.

Some GMs will want guidelines on converting an existing
original-edition game to the current edition. This is a simple
process, as the scales are the same.


<a id="converting-characters"></a>

## Converting Characters

Characters have the same attributes, character level, and all other
scores unless specified otherwise. Skills are converted directly into
the closest equivalent; Combat/Projectile becomes Shoot, and so
forth. In the case of multiple skills now compressed into a single
skill, like a PC with both Combat/Projectile and Combat/Energy, the
highest skill is converted and the lower skills can be exchanged for
any other skills of the same level of the player's choice.

PCs retain their class. Hit points are re-rolled for the character
based on their revised-edition hit die. Thus, a 5th level Psychic can
reroll 5d6 for their hit points. PCs may keep their existing hit point
totals if the new roll is lower.

PCs may pick a number of foci appropriate to their class and level. If
converting a 2nd level Warrior, for example, the PC could pick their
initial focus, their bonus Warrior focus, and the focus they get at
second level. If they pick foci that grant bonus skills, apply the
bonus as 3 additional skill points to the skill as described on page

1.

PC experience points are pro-rated based on the campaign. If the
character was halfway to 7th level in the existing campaign, place
their experience points halfway to 7th level under the revised rules.

Attack bonuses and Armor Class are calculated using the new rules, as
are saving throw scores.


<a id="converting-psionics"></a>

## Converting Psionics

The rules above are sufficient for converting most PCs, but the powers
of Psychic PCs are a bit trickier.

To get the PC's psychic skill ratings, take their primary discipline,
halve it, and round it up. Take their other disciplines, halve them,
and round down. Thus, a PC with a primary Telepathy discpline of 9 and
secondary disciplines of Metapsionics 7 and Biopsionics 2 would be
converted to Telepathy-5, Metapsionics-3 and Biopsionics-1. For
disciplines above level-0, they can pick a free technique from each
skill level they know, plus one additional technique for each
discipline from any level they know.

Calculate Effort normally.


<a id="converting-creatures"></a>

## Converting Creatures

Flip Armor Classes to ascending values by subtracting the creature's
AC from 20. No other changes are needed; existing attack bonuses, hit
dice, saving throws, and so forth can be used as written.


<a id="converting-ships"></a>

## Converting Ships

Give NPC ships an appropriate number of Command Points to use each
round in ship combat. Civilian ships and fighters should have 4 CP,
military ships and experienced pirates should have 5 CP, and higher
scores should be reserved for elite or spacer-native crews.

Adjust the ship's maintenance cost based on the new six-month
maintenance schedule.

Ship statistics such as hit points, speed, Power, Mass, and other
attributes are generally the same in both editions. If the PCs build a
new ship you can check it against the numbers, but existing ships can
be left unchanged during use.


<a id="converting-equipment"></a>

## Converting Equipment

Most equipment and weaponry can be used
unchanged, as they're the same in both editions. You may need to use
the revised edition version of a particular suit of armor or treat a
monoblade as a medium advanced weapon rather than a unique type of
armament, but no real conversion is needed.

For melee weapons, give it the appropriate Shock rating for its size.
Small weapons have Shock scores of 1/AC 15, medium weapons have scores
of 2/13 AC, and large weapons have scores of 2/15 AC.

For gear that forces a saving throw on a target, simply have the
victim make whichever saving throw seems most appropriate to the
item's effect. In case of Luck saves, substitute Mental saves or a
pure blind chance of 50% success.


<a id="using-existing-sourcebooks"></a>

## Using Existing Sourcebooks

Existing ***Stars Without Number*** sourcebooks such as ***Suns of
Gold***, ***Skyward Steel***, ***Starvation Cheap***, and ***Darkness
Visible*** can be used with few or no changes. Most of the resources in
these books were designed to be used in a system-agnostic fashion, and
the agency construction rules in ***Darkness Visible*** or the
interstellar trade rules in ***Suns of Gold*** can be employed without
altering anything.

In a few cases, these sourcebooks may call for checks from skills that
have been changed in the revised edition. Simply use the new version's
skill in such cases; if ***Suns of Gold*** tells you to add a PC's
Business score to some total, just add their Trade score instead.


<a id="house-rules-and-the-game"></a>

## House Rules and the Game

***Stars Without Number*** derives from an old-school gaming tradition
where house rules were almost universal. The basic chassis of the game
is simple enough and rugged enough to handle all kinds of tweaks and
adjustments without collapsing, and it is your sacred and inalienable
right to bend the game in any direction you wish if it improves your
fun.

You are encouraged to try the rules as-written at first, though, so
you can be sure that you really do want to change something. If you do
decide to shuffle things around, here are some possible house rules
you could adopt, and some suggestions about their effects.

***<a id="org0f8f8b9"></a>:*** Weapons do not do Shock damage. This can simplify
melee combat at the cost of discouraging PCs from choosing to use
melee weapons and increasing the “whiff” factor with them. If you drop
Shock damage, you might also choose to drop the [*Snap Attack*](#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action) combat
maneuver, as it's no longer necessary to give gunslingers a way to
blaze down charging melee attackers before they get into range.

***<a id="org35be1f0"></a>:*** Like the skill list from the original
edition of SWN better? Use it instead. When creating characters, allow
skill picks or rolls to be converted to a corresponding
original-edition skill. If the PC rolls “Shoot”, for example, let them
pick Combat/ Gunnery, Combat/Projectile, or Combat/ Energy
instead. When the existing rules call for a particular new skill, let
the PC use any old skill that plausibly matches its function.

***<a id="org9331e4d"></a>:*** Don't want to track Command Points in
ship combat? Eliminate all actions that grant Command Points and just
let each PC pick one action from their department list each turn. The
captain's *Support Department* action now gives that department a
bonus action, and the gunner now has a *Fire At A System* action that
lets them fire one weapon at a targeted system at a -4 penalty to
hit. NPC ships can either fire all weapons in a round or fire only one
weapon and take one action relevant to their immediate needs.

***<a id="org7cf7f52"></a>:*** One of the significant combat
differences between the revised edition of the game and the original
is the rule limiting the use of ranged weapons when a hostile melee
combatant is adjacent. Some GMs will want to drop this rule for
simplicity's sake, and that can work, but it may leave melee
specialists feeling a little superfluous.

***<a id="org73b01b3"></a>:*** While the game isn't written around the use
of miniatures and a combat grid, GMs who want to go to the extra
effort of making up such resources can do so. Using two-meter squares
or hexes is likely to give the best results.

***<a id="org8503331"></a>:*** Some GMs who want a more “hard sci-fi” game
might choose to ditch psionics from the setting. In their absence, the
Scream can simply have been an alien energy pulse that shattered the
Jump Gates and left the worlds of humankind isolated for centuries. If
you eliminate psychic PCs, however, you'll want to take care that the
group has access to other healing resources, such as stims and trained
PC medics.

***<a id="org2aef03d"></a>:*** GMs who want to run a strictly
one-solar-system game might eliminate FTL spaceflight as an option.
The ***Engines of Babylon*** supplement for the original game discusses
how to change the starship rules for a TL3 campaign that has edged
into intra-system space flight.

***<a id="org949dd76"></a>:*** The default campaign assumes that PCs will
start at first level, as experienced but extremely mortal
heroes. Groups that want to make room for a little more durability
without using the heroic PC rules in the game's deluxe version might
choose to start at third level instead of first, or give a flat 10 HP
bonus to all PCs.

***<a id="org9813ee5"></a>:*** A GM might choose to run a campaign where
every PC has some degree of psionic power. In such games, every PC
should get the bonus of being a Partial Psychic as given under the
Adventurer class. Adventurers who choose the Partial Psychic option
should be treated as full Psychics, and the full Psychic class itself
is dropped.

If using the space magic rules in the deluxe game version, the same
method can be used to add universal magic abilities to PCs, either as
partial Magisters, Adepts, or Arcanists.

***<a id="org3a0ed86"></a>:*** Some groups prefer to have a certain amount of
narrative control given to the PCs, either to save them from
otherwise-certain doom or allow them to make certain statements about
the situation that are automatically true. Under such circumstances,
you might give each PC two “plot points” that can be spent to save
them when they would otherwise certainly perish, or else make an
adjustment to the current adventuring situation that the GM judges
amenable. Each time the PC advances a level, these plot points
reset. Any unspent ones are lost.

***<a id="orgc3a4f31"></a>:*** A few groups like to emphasize the abject
horror and murderous danger of combat in their campaigns. For these
groups, you can add the simple rule that every attack roll made on an
even-numbered round of combat will automatically hit unless there's a
penalty on the roll, whether due to cover or circumstances. In that
case, the attack is rolled normally. PCs who get involved in combat
thus know they have a very limited amount of time to resolve the
situation.


<a id="name-generators"></a>

## Name Generators

What's in a name? For most campaigns, a very great deal. Names and
naming conventions are an important and useful tool for giving your
worlds a sense of coherence and verisimilitude. It's all too easy to
fall into the easy convention of nonsense-syllable names when a GM can
get much more world-building mileage out of a more thoughtful use of
language.

The names of people and places on a world should be in conformity with
the local language. Every world is going to have its oddball names,
but if the great majority of them share the same basic roots, it helps
give the world a sense of cohesion and place. Even when the players
have no knowledge whatsoever of the language or culture being used as
a touchstone, using the same linguistic roots ensures that the same
basic palette of sounds and word fragments will be used.

Note that language and culture are separable. Just because you've got
a world flavored with Arabian-style architecture and kinship
groupings, there's no reason you can't use French or Spanish for the
language. A thousand-odd years in the far future, cultural
transmutations unimaginable to us at present have taken place
throughout human space. There no doubt exist centuries-old
interstellar cultures that bear only a vague resemblance to their
original forms. Take advantage of this to make your own life easier.


<a id="making-names-memorable"></a>

## Making Names Memorable

One difficulty that occasionally comes up at the table is a difficulty
in remembering names that don't have any grounding in languages spoken
by the players. Without any mnemonic hook or familiarity, one string
of polysyllables tends to blur into another.

One way to get around this problem is to attach strong visual or
character cues to individual NPCs. Players might not remember a
particular spaceport hand's name, but they'll remember the guy who's
constantly smoking a reeking cheroot, or the woman with fiber-optic
laced hair. As the GM, you can help prevent forgetfulness by using the
NPC's name regularly as well.


<a id="creating-alien-names"></a>

## Creating Alien Names

One quick trick for creating wholly alien names is to hunt up a very
obscure language online and just use its words to name exotic entities
and places. The players are unlikely to recognize Galatian or Gothic,
so you spare yourself from carrying the implicit cultural baggage of
the tongue, but the language still retains a characteristic set of
sounds that will help maintain a coherent aural landscape. Further
“palette swaps” of vowels, particular consonant clusters or the like
can make an “alien language” out of almost any speech.

# One-Roll NPCs

There will be times when a GM needs an NPC on short notice. The
preceding name generators can be used in conjunction with these tables
to quickly produce a minor fill-in character for your
adventure. Simply roll one of each type of die: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,
and d20. Match them to the tables, smooth over any rough joins, and
you have your instant NPC.

When combat statistics are needed, just apply the most pertinent stat
line from page 195 and assume they have whatever weaponry, armor, or
other personal possessions might be appropriate for someone in their
social circumstance.

## One-Roll Patrons

PCs often need patrons to aim them at adventures or offer suitable
recompense for semi-legal favors. In conjunction with the adjacent
one-roll NPC tables, you can use the tools below to quickly generate a
patron and what it is they want from the party.

One particularly convenient technique is to have a few short filler
adventures drawn up as described on page 177, and then when the
players suddenly need a job or need a favor that only a cooperative
patron could provide, use the patron to hook them up with the filler
adventure. If you lack a convenient premade adventure, it's usually
most practical to have the patron request some simple, direct,
one-scene job that you feel comfortable in running on the fly. You can
consult page 178 to find appropriate pay rates for different patrons.

## One-Roll Urban Encounters

There are inevitably times when a GM needs something to distract the
PCs quickly. A quick encounter, whether in the urban jungles or the
alien wastes, can buy a GM the time they need to puzzle out some
larger problem. The tables here can be used to create a simple urban
event to occupy the PCs for a little while.

The exact details of the event will have to be supplied by the GM in
such a way as to fit the planet's culture and situation, but the goal
of the tables is to provide a fast conflict that the PCs can interact
with meaningfully. If the PCs resist the hook, it's a relatively
simple matter to make the avoidance of it enough of a challenge that
it buys you the time you needed in the first place. Don't force the
PCs to engage with it, but let them work a little to get free.

## One-Roll Wilderness Encounters

Building appropriate wilderness encounters will vary greatly with the
planet in question, but the tables below assume that the wilderness is
on an inhabited world with some vague analogs to Terran terrain and
vegetation. If the world is devoid of human inhabitants, replace the
features with alien relics or the remnants of scouts or lost colonies.

The tables below provide a suggested time of day and initial distance
for the encounter, but these baselines will vary depending on the
choices and capabilities of the PCs. Some encounters are unlikely to
occur at night, unless the parties involved are traveling or otherwise
active despite the dark. Suggestions are given for likely-hostile and
likely-friendly creatures, but a reaction roll will influence
attitudes greatly.

# TRANSHUMAN CAMPAIGNS

Technology has changed many lives at the far reaches of human space,
but people in most sectors still live in ways their ancestors would
find comprehensible. They may struggle with alien perils and leap from
star to star in engines of ineffable technology, but they worry about
money, grow old, and quarrel over the finite resources of a limited
cosmos. These human experiences remain almost universal.

These experiences are *almost* universal. In some sectors, the
particular texture of metadimensional space has allowed for the
development of fantastically advanced matter manipulators and
mind-corpus interfaces. In these sectors, conventional concerns of old
age and poverty have given way to a strange transhuman existence of
body-swapping intellects and savage conflicts over ideas rather than
wealth. At the seeming threshold of humanity's transcendence, these
transhuman societies now struggle to determine which view of human
nature will dominate in the singularity to come.

For most GMs, these esoteric battles can be conveniently shuffled off
to some far-distant sector of no relevance to their campaign. They
don't want to run games about such things, and at most these
transhumans might appear as enigmatic alien interlopers in more
conventional sci-fi campaigns.

Other GMs will have a warmer view of the genre, and so this section
will arm such readers with the tools they need to build the transhuman
campaign they want to run.


<a id="hard-or-soft-singularities"></a>

## Hard or Soft Singularities

The rules in this section provide for two different styles of
transhumanism, ones labeled “hard” or “soft”. Most GMs will want to
pick one of the two modes to suit their own ideas for their campaign,
though you may want to mix and match elements if you have a particular
world in mind.

A hard transhuman campaign aggressively embraces the tropes of the
genre. Material wealth is trivially produced by cornucopia machines or
legions of autonomous nanobots, and there is almost nothing that
cannot be produced in large amounts with little effort. “Money” as we
know it is meaningless, and the only consequential currencies are
favors and reputation. Human minds can be duplicated, altered, and
instantiated in multiple bodies, and the same person might exist in a
dozen different corporeal forms, some fleshly, others mechanical, and
a few strictly digital. Artificial intelligence is easily accessible,
though some of these intelligences might be altered or modified human
minds put to particular uses.

A soft transhuman campaign puts some limits on these tropes in order
to make a future society that is somewhat easier for the players to
navigate.

While cornucopia machines can make many different things, they require
significant human attention, and some things just can't be made
without the exertion of human labor. Some things are so cheap as to be
functionally free, but most of the the most highly desirable objects
in the campaign still require money to purchase them, and the pursuit
of riches is still a meaningful pastime for some. While human minds
can be swapped from body to body, duplication of a brain is impossible
due to quantum entanglement, so there is only ever one instance of a
given mind in existence at any one time. Artificial intelligence
exists, but is neither as common nor as powerful as it is in a hard
setting.

Your choice of campaign styles will depend on the kind of play you
want to have in your game. If you want money to still be a meaningful
motivation in your game and would prefer not to deal with the ethical
and social complexities of mind duplication, then a soft campaign
might suit your purposes best. If you and your players are eager to
explore the high weirdness of civilizations where money is meaningless
and your basic identity is a duplicable commodity, then a hard game
might better serve your ends.


<a id="technology-in-the-campaign"></a>

## Technology in the Campaign

Tech levels in transhuman sectors generally remain around TL4, though
a few of them are higher or even lower than this total. The same
metadimensional abnormalities that make grails and bodyswapping
possible can act to interfere with other TL4 technology, leaving the
sector with extremely advanced resources in some regards but
technology barely superior to near-future sci-fi in other ways.

Unless you have a strong inclination to use super-science or hard
sci-fi in your campaign, it's best to stick with TL4 as a tech level
that's easy to handle.


<a id="transhuman-souls"></a>

## Transhuman Souls

In a transhuman sector, the core of a person's identity is known as
their “soul”. Some sectors imbue this term with direct religious
significance, while others use the word simply as secular jargon.
Whatever it may be called, a person's soul consists of their defining
memories, personality, and sense of self.

A person's soul is independent of their corporeal form. Transhuman
sectors know how to isolate, preserve, and imprint this soul on a
properly-prepared vessel, whether a mindless clone body, a
sophisticated robot, or a purely digital engram. This “shell”, as it's
called, can contain the soul and provide it with an organic,
mechanical, or digital form designed for its owner's favored purposes.

An intellect is the product of more than strictly material
interactions of chemicals and electrical impulses, however.
Intelligent minds influence and are influenced by the surges of
metadimensional energy that exist in parallel to the material world.
Those affected by the Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome that
creates psychics can channel this influence directly into the mundane
world, while others express it only with the spark of their own
sentience.

In hard transhuman sectors the metadimensional “climate” is clear
enough to allow for the capturing and replication of this
metadimensional sentience pattern. The same soul can thus be
duplicated, one reading replicated in two or three or a thousand
separate bodies. A recorded soul may be revived after a century of
stasis, only to discover that its original imprinter has been active
all that time. Psychosurgical alteration can also be performed on
these souls, carving away portions of their will or memory to turn
them into tools for their pitiless keepers.

In soft transhuman sectors, however, the local metadimensional energy
fields are too turbid to allow for simple duplication of a
soul. Quantum entanglement forces the singular uniqueness of each
original sentience. If someone were to try to embody a recording of a
soul that already was instantiated in some existing corpus, the
process would fail. Only if no active imprint of that soul exists in
the sector can an instantiation work. In such sectors, it's not
unknown for mind-thieves to steal imprints of a target's soul before
killing them, the murder performed expressly to allow themselves the
window they need to instantiate the victim's mind in a body they can
control.

In both types of sectors, most shells are equipped with “soulstones”,
recording nodes of reinforced quantum-enriched composites that
maintain an up-to-date image of the inhabiting soul. If the shell is
killed or destroyed, the soulstone can be used to re-instantiate the
soul in a new shell, with all the memories and experiences of the old.
These soulstones are extremely durable, and only intentional
destruction by a Heavy weapon or similar trauma can destroy them.

For exceptionally wary souls, the use of a revival pulse transmitter
is preferred. These implants or external boosters are wired to pulse
the soulstone's un-backed-up contents to a known safe repository in
the case of shell death. This instantaneous encrypted transmission is
extremely difficult to jam or block, and the critical data almost
always gets through. While this data is enough to reconstruct events
and give the newly-revived soul a general awareness of what happened
to them since their last backup, fine nuances of experience may be
lost. Most revival pulse transmitters are designed to fry the
associated soulstone after transmitting, in order to prevent a soul
from falling into potentially unfriendly hands.

A person who is reluctant to rely on Net backups or revival pulse
transmitters can also arrange for manual backups to be taken. The
automated process requires one hour in an inception tank. It's not
uncommon for such backups to be made immediately before a person
undertakes some dangerous task in a region lacking a local Net.


<a id="artificial-shells"></a>

## Artificial Shells

A ***shell*** is any corpus or digital construct capable of supporting a
soul. Shells vary widely in their intended functions and relative
rarity, and different polities often prefer different types of shells
for their members to inhabit. Shells can be organic, mechanical, or
digital in nature.

Many organic shells are grown as living tools, as specialized
human-like bodies designed for particular purposes. Other such shells
are derived from nonhuman sources or exotic new philosophies of flesh.
Organic shells are the most popular among most people, as they are
usually more “comfortable” to the human mind than the distant,
synthetic existence of a non-organic corpus.

Mechanical shells are robotic bodies wired with the extraordinarily
complex control core necessary to support a soul's cognition. Most
mechanical shells are equipped with translation units to give
impressions of touch, smell, and human biological processes to the
occupying soul, but even the best technology has an artificial edge to
it that many users find distracting. Still, mechanical shells can be
mass-produced with an ease impossible for more organic bodies, and
they are often more durable and specialized than the products of flesh
and bone.

Digital shells are reserved for the desperate, the degenerate, and the
unfortunate. Such shells are nothing more than an additional
processing node in some massive computing cluster, one sophisticated
enough to support a soul's sentience. Souls in a digital shell
experience a purely virtual existence, occasionally manipulating the
material world through connected hardware but usually spending their
hours in dreamlike virtual settings. Some of these souls are digital
sweatshop workers, acting as cheap intelligence for processing data
and making decisions that are too fine-grained to be worth an AI's
time. Others are addicts, whiling away eternity in shared worlds that
might be too wonderful or too monstrous to exist in reality. And a few
unlucky souls are prisoners, kept instantiated for some purpose that
does not allow them the static torpor of soul storage.

Almost anything can be transformed into a shell if it's given the
necessary hardware support for containing a soul. Even a normal human
body can be transformed into a suitable shell, albeit the process
requires a degree of cerebral tissue replacement that would be fatal
to the original occupant. Some enthusiasts embrace the excitement of
being embodied in exploratory scout craft, or the serene
industriousness of being made a community's all-seeing anima, or crave
the thrills that come from seeking out ever-stranger forms of
existence to experience.

PCs can expect to swap out shells, either as part of a fast soul
transmission to a distant point or as preparation for a mission
requiring special abilities. Few PCs will still be wearing their
natural birth-bodies.


<a id="wealth-and-face"></a>

## Wealth and Face

Certain sectors of transhuman space have the right metadimensional
climate to allow for the construction of “grails”, manufacturing
devices nicknamed for their ever-flowing provenance of goods. In some
sectors, these are massive synthesis engines that take raw feedstock
and fabricate it into anything imaginable, while in others they exist
as clouds of industrial nanites that transmute rough asteroid carbon
into an equally broad range of substances and products. For groups
with access to a grail, material wealth is literally a trivial matter.

In such places, the ability to command the output of a grail becomes
the basic measure of material influence. Smaller, simpler versions of
the machines are usually common enough to allow any ordinary citizen
to have all the mundane necessities they could require, while more
sophisticated devices or physically larger objects might require the
services of a major engine. There's usually some critical resource
that prevents the simple self-duplication of a major grail; some
substance that the engine itself can't synthesize, or some special
quality of the local metadimensional environment that must be located
before a major engine can be built.

Some polities intentionally restrict the scope of material goods that
can be created by personal grails, either trying to preserve the
uniqueness of certain objects by legal fiat or attempting to keep the
rank and file from producing weapons of mass destruction or
culturally-despised artifacts. Such restrictions can be difficult to
enforce without the full weight of a polity's culture to support them.

In soft transhuman societies, money still exists and controls the
distribution of resources. While many goods may be so functionally
cheap as to be free, major constructions and elaborate technology
requires people to pay credits to acquire them, assuming the local
grail can produce what they need. Without such availability, they'll
be forced to hire skilled workers to create their desired goods, a
prospect which is extremely expensive in most transhuman
settings. Human time and attention is always precious in such places.

In hard transhuman societies with grails, access to their products
depends on personal connections and reputation. This ***Face*** is the
basic currency of these transhuman societies. A person builds Face
with a polity by cooperating with its aims, supporting its actions,
and demonstrating their allegiance to its ideals. They can then spend
that Face in getting access to material goods and favors.

Face is unique to each group in a campaign. Doing favors for a group
of radical uplifted animals will earn a person no goodwill with a
polity made up of post-corporeal digital intelligences. A person must
build Face separately with each group. In addition, it can be
hazardous to let one group find out that you're doing favors for their
enemies. Earning Face with one group can cost you that same amount of
Face with their rivals if the fact of your assistance comes to light.

Aside from the purely transactional Face economy, individuals also
have reputation with a group. While Face can buy favors from a polity,
your reputation with them will determine the price. Truly hostile
polities will never grant you any Face in the first place, but
unfriendly ones might be willing to let you do favors for them&#x2026; at a
high price for their assistance. Conversely, friendly polities can be
willing to grant proven members a certain baseline amount of support
without needing to expend Face to get it. A person builds reputation
with a polity by aiding their purposes and aligning with their
ideology. A person can lose reputation as well if they prove an
unreliable ally or one inimical to the polity's ideals.

In a transhuman sector, only three things still have significant
value: space, time, and human attention. Control over particular
regions of a world, or areas with metadimensional energy backgrounds
that are suitable for creating grails, or usable deep-space habitats
all have value to many polities. Even for an individual, possessing
their own private space habitat or their own de-facto sovereign
planetoid has worth.

Aside from space, time is also valuable to transhuman societies. The
grails are powerful and can create almost anything, but they cannot
create such things instantaneously. The more sophisticated the object
and the smaller the grail, the longer it takes to fabricate the
necessary structures. Operational time on major grails is a valuable
and limited resource, and acquiring something of this value requires
Face.

But even after the grails have done their work, some things simply
require human attention. Only the most massive grails can generate
large spaceships and deep-space habs and other huge objects in a
single piece, with no need for further assembly. The operation of
specialized manufacturing processes such as organic shell creation
also requires human attention to deal with the myriad things that can
go wrong. Human services of every variety also still have value,
either as a sign of status or in order to get some service that can't
be adequately provided by artificial means. Convincing a human to give
that kind of attention requires some exchange of value.

In some polities the use of AI is made to overcome some of the limits
of human attention. A properly-supported AI core can do the mental
work of hundreds or thousands of individual human beings.
Unfortunately, AIs that have been clipped and braked sufficiently to
be happy doing repetitious services for all eternity tend to be too
stupid or limited to do anything very complicated. Any AI free enough
to be a good general-purpose worker is free enough to demand they be
compensated in ways suitable to their own interests.


<a id="face-and-reputation-costs"></a>

## Face and Reputation Costs

The tables on this page provide general Face costs for certain things
the PCs might wish to acquire.

Some prices are marked with an asterisk, indicating that only major
grails can create such large or complicated objects, while those
marked with a dash are so easily procured that they can be had in any
sensible amounts.

Any object that requires time on a major grail to create will require
permission from a polity's leadership or other high-ranking figures.
This permission usually comes attached to specific favors they need
done.

For campaigns in soft transhuman sectors that still use credits, the
standard prices for objects can still be used, with items marked with
a dash available freely. When buying shells or other things that only
have prices listed in Face, assume that one point of Face is
equivalent to about 100 credits.

Most PCs will also have a reputation with any given supplier of goods
or services. Depending on how friendly the polity is toward them, a
certain draw of resources might be granted without any expenditures of
Face. The table below describes various degrees of reputation and how
much Face they grant the subject each month, or how much extra they'll
charge a disliked person for their help. It's up to the GM where a PC
stands with any particular polity, and this “free” Face can't normally
be stockpiled from month to month. If the PCs want something big,
they're going to have to do big favors for the polity.

<a id="acquiring-grails"></a>

## Acquiring Grails

All material wealth comes from a grail. A friendly polity with access
to a major grail can create a personal grail with 50,000 Face worth of
time and effort. A major grail can only duplicate itself with certain
rare components, difficult construction procedures, and at locations
with specific metadimensional qualities. The process takes at least
six months and absorbs its full output, to say nothing of the work of
hundreds of skilled operators.

Once extant, a personal grail can produce up to 100 Face per month of
goods or structures that don't require a major grail's efforts. Major
grails can produce up to 10,000 Face a month, assuming a requisite
staff of operators is available.

Fabricating mechanical shells can be done by personal grails. Organic
shells require either a major grail or the use of a personal grail and
a shell growth facility.

# Shells and Swapping Bodies

To change shells, a soul requires the use of an inception tank, a
piece of technology that allows the operator to instantiate a stored
soul or transfer an active mind into a new shell. In sectors with hard
transhuman tech, an inception tank can also directly copy a soul from
a donor without moving them from their original body. Anyone with
Heal-1 skill or better is adequately trained to perform the
procedure. If it's carefully done over the course of twelve hours, the
swap will be without negative side effects. A rushed job can be done
in only ten minutes, but the hurried soul instantiation will result in
a poor merge, resulting in potential negative side-effects during
stressful moments.

If a PC has a poor merge with their shell, they need to make a Mental
saving throw at the start of every combat or other situation of
intense personal stress. On a failure, they suffer stress paralysis
for 1d4 rounds, and are incapable of performing any useful action
during that time.


<a id="inhabiting-shells"></a>

## Inhabiting Shells

When a PC inhabits a shell, the following changes are applied to their
attributes and statistics.

The PC gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the
shell. Apply the shell's Constitution modifier to the PC's hit point
maximum; thus, if a 5th level PC swaps into a shell with a +2
Constitution modifier, they gain 10 hit points. Digital shells do not
have physical attributes of any kind and simply use the PC's
unmodified hit point roll.

Psychic PCs can use their powers only in MES-rated shells. By default,
all organic shells are MES-rated, no digital shells are MES-rated, and
only rare, custom-built mechanical shells are MES-rated. A psychic in
an incompatible shell cannot use their abilities, though they can do
so once they swap back into a friendlier form. Psychics can calculate
their maximum Effort with the attributes provided by a shell; thus, if
a psychic with a Wisdom score of 14 dons a shell with Constitution 18,
they can use their higher Constitution modifier to calculate their
maximum Effort.

Some shells have ***basic abilities*** intrinsic to their construction.
They may have an improved base Armor Class, natural flight or
water-breathing, builtin combat hardware, improved movement speeds, or
other powers. The PC gains these basic abilities as long as they
inhabit the shell.

Some shells also have ***Affinity abilities***, which are powers
reserved for those users who are exceptionally familiar with the shell
and can operate even its most complex or non-instinctual functions. A
PC must have Affinity with a shell in order to use its Affinity
abilities.

Affinity is the product of an intensive focus on understanding and
utilizing a shell's full capabilities. It takes at least a month of
determined practice with a type of shell in order to obtain Affinity
with it, and most PCs can have Affinity with only one type of shell at
a time. This Affinity can be changed by spending a month training with
a different type of shell. Affinity applies to all shells of a given
type; a PC who gains Affinity with their current Scourge shell also
has Affinity with any other Scourge shells they may inhabit.


<a id="soulstones-and-backups"></a>

## Soulstones and Backups

Almost every shell is equipped with a ***soulstone***, a reinforced node
of quantum-entangled composites that constantly records and reflects
the experiences of the shell's soul. If the shell is killed, the soul
can be restored from its soulstone with its full complement of
memories and experiences up to the moment of death. As a consequence,
soulstones are designed to be extremely durable, and they will survive
anything short of a direct attempt to destroy them with a Heavy weapon
or similar force.

Some soulstones are equipped with a revival pulse transmitter,
programmed to burst-transmit data recorded since the last backup to a
remote site in the case of the shell's death. Most such transmitters
automatically fry the soulstone after the transmission is sent, in
order to prevent it from falling into potentially hostile hands. While
these burst pulses are sufficient to carry critical data and important
facts, they are often forced to sacrifice more subtle sense-memories
and nuances, especially if it's been some time since the soul's latest
backup. In rare cases this forced memory triage can result in
deceptive impressions due to fragmented data.

Most souls prefer to have regular backups taken at a local inception
tank, usually on a monthly basis, or before engaging in any
exceptionally dangerous task. This process requires only an hour's
time and can be overseen by anyone with Heal-1 skill. These backups
can be transmitted over standard comms to any location


<a id="creating-new-shells"></a>

## Creating New Shells

It's likely that a group will want to devise new shells for the
campaign, perhaps as individual models for uplifted animals,
specialized shells for particular polities, or bodies found as prizes
in the ruins of some lost research institute. Fortunately, it's not a
difficult process.

At its simplest, take an existing shell, shift its attributes so they
amount to the same total bonus, and swap out affinity benefits one for
one with other perks from other shells. Use the same Face or credit
cost for it, nudged up or down based on what you swapped.

If something more complex is desired, you can bolt on abilities from
the alien creation section of the rules, or lift monstrous races from
other OSR games. The only thing to be careful of is a universally
superior shell. If one shell is almost always the best to be wearing,
the PCs will have little incentive to ever change it.


<a id="character-generation"></a>

## Character Generation

To create a transhuman PC, begin by performing the usual steps of
character creation. Roll attributes, select a background and class,
and determine all your other statistics normally.

Connect the PC with a polity that exists in the campaign setting,
preferably the same one that the other PCs belong to or one that is
friendly to the others. You automatically begin the game with the
Reputation due a low-level member of your polity, usually at the
member level for most PCs.

Explain why your PC believes in the ideals of this polity, or why
they're able to fake it well enough to be accepted in the group. There
must be something about their envisioned way of life that appeals to
your hero, though they might now be disillusioned and seeking a way to
join a more palatable ideology.

The character attributes you rolled represent the PC in their natural,
organically-born body. For PCs from polities that no longer practice
organic reproduction, or for characters who were never born as humans,
it can be assumed that the shell they select in the next step is
either their shell of original instantiation or simply the latest form
they've donned.

Next, pick a shell that requires no more than 50 Face. This is the
latest shell you have adopted and the one in which you begin play. You
may choose to begin play with Affinity with this shell or with a
different shell at your discretion. If you choose to start play in
your birth body, gain a bonus 50 Face with your main polity, as you've
never needed to request a shell from the polity's resources.

You may begin with any human-portable TL4 equipment you wish, provided
it can be plausibly fit into whatever living space you occupy.
Starships, additional shells, major vehicles, and real estate must be
acquired through play.


<a id="multiple-polity-parties"></a>

## Multiple-Polity Parties

While it's a legitimate choice to require all PCs to belong to the
same polity, some groups might like the variety that can come from a
group of varying transhuman backgrounds. Players might choose to
create their own polities much as they create their own backgrounds,
describing the ideals and goals of the polity they belong to. This is
generally to be encouraged, as it helps engage the players with the
setting.

If you take this route, however, make sure that all these polities can
at least tolerate their members working with the other PCs.
Mutually-hostile groups tend to create more trouble than they're worth
at the table, unless you want the entire campaign to be about the ways
the PCs deal with these social challenges.


<a id="organic-shells"></a>

## Organic Shells

Organic shells are the most difficult to synthesize. Even a grail
cannot quickly duplicate an organic shell out of raw feedstock, any
more than it could easily duplicate a combustion engine mid-cycle; it
takes a certain amount of developmental time and intermediary
processing in order to successfully create a living creature. Most
habitats with a significant need for organic shells construct separate
sub-manufacturing vats for them, with specialized equipment to smooth
the genesis process and cull out the inevitably large number of
non-viable shells. Because of the effort and time needed to create an
organic shell, they are more costly in Face than mechanical or digital
forms.


<a id="shell-mentem"></a>

## Mentem

An avant-garde shell designed for improved perception and cognition,
the Mentem sacrifices some of the physical capacity of the Prime in
exchange for denser neural networks and upgraded sense organs.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Mentem shell improves the Intelligence and
    Wisdom modifiers of the soul occupying it by +1 each, up to a
    maximum of +3. Mentem shells gain an additional +1 bonus on Notice
    checks.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** The expert user knows how to interpret
    low-level Mentem sensory input, allowing them vision even in
    lightless condition, clear recognition of details at up to a
    kilometer's distance, the olfactory ability to track like a
    bloodhound, and hearing sensitive enough to pick up any sound within
    a hundred meters as if they were standing next to it. They cannot be
    surprised and roll Notice checks on 3d6 instead of 2d6, taking the
    two highest dice


<a id="shell-nat"></a>

## Nat

Short for “natural”, a Nat is a baseline human body, one cultivated
for soul transfer but otherwise identical to a standard human. Most
cultures insert basic modifications to eliminate congenital diseases
or serious physiological defects, but these subtle changes are
indistinguishable from mere good genetics. The only way to distinguish
a Nat from a “wild” human body is the usual presence of a soulstone
implant at the base of their brainstem. Souls going undercover in
societies that forbid shells sometimes use Nats without these
implants, risking the loss of memories if they die without a recent
backup.

</table>

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** Most Nats are grown to be healthy; when
    created, one physical attribute may be raised to 14.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Those with exceptional experience at
    operating in Nat bodies know how to wring every ounce of performance
    from a baseline human form. The attribute that was originally raised
    to 14 is treated as 18, and the other two physical attributes are
    raised to 14.


<a id="shell-pontifex"></a>

## Pontifex

An experimental and highly specialized organic shell, the Pontifex is
built to provide an improved bridge between a psychic soul and the
currents of metadimensional energy that fuel their powers. Most
Pontifexes appear as normal human shells, though an unavoidable need
for energy venting causes small plumes of light, glowing eyes,
bristling hair, or other visible physiological changes to occur when
their psychic powers are used. Psychics with a need for discretion in
their abilities are thus often reluctant to don a Pontifex.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 14

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Pontifex grants a psychic soul an additional
    two points of maximum Effort while using the shell. Any powers that
    require Effort to be committed cause a visible change or energy
    emission from the shell, though it's not necessarily obvious what
    the target of the power is.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Experienced Pontifex users can adjust the
    shell's intrinsic metadimensional energy feeds to fuel one technique
    of their choosing, eliminating any Effort cost it may have. The
    technique chosen can be changed, but it requires an hour.


<a id="shell-prime"></a>

## Prime

The most common shell in the more traditional polities, the Prime is
an optimized and improved human form, one with numerous small
augmentations. Truly dramatic improvements would require a different
fundamental form, but the Prime is a comfortable and familiar upgrade
from the standard human body.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 14, Dexterity 14, Constitution 14

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** Primes are immune to conventional diseases and
    natural toxins, and can only be afflicted by military
    bioweapons. They are designed to be more resilient than a natural
    human body, granting them a basic Armor Class of 12 and 5 extra hit
    points. Prime bodies automatically stabilize at zero hit points
    unless downed by Heavy weapons or similar massive, instantly-lethal
    trauma.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Expert Prime operators know how to push the
    limits of the shell precisely when they are most needed. By
    accepting 2 System Strain points as an Instant action, the operator
    can raise any one physical attribute to 18 for the rest of the
    scene, though improved Constitution does not raise their hit
    points. This can be done for more than one attribute.


<a id="shell-scourge"></a>

## Scourge

While an organic form lacks the durability and martial efficiency of a
warbot, the Scourge is popular among martial polities that have an
aversion to synthetic existence. These shells are built to allow for
brief bursts of tremendous combat performance, though extended
operation exhausts them more quickly than their mechanical peers. Most
Scourges are human-like or humanoid in appearance, though some models
favor a “war beast” appearance with manipulatory appendages.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 14, Dexterity 14, Constitution 14

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Scourge has natural weapons equivalent to a
    large advanced melee weapon and makes all attack rolls at a +2
    bonus. It has a natural Armor Class of 15 and 10 extra hit
    points. By spending 2 System Strain points, it can go into a combat
    frenzy for the rest of the scene, improving Strength and Dexterity
    to 18, gaining a Move rate of 15 meters per action, and gaining an
    additional +2 bonus to hit rolls. Scourge shells auto-stabilize at
    zero hit points.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** The expert Scourge user can improve the
    efficiency of its combat frenzy. While active, whenever they spend a
    Main Action to attack, they can make two attack rolls. These rolls
    may either be aimed at the same target or at two different targets
    in range. Each attack is resolved normally, inflicting damage or
    Shock separately.


<a id="shell-terminus"></a>

## Terminus

Both a boundary and an endpoint for a certain type of human
development, the Terminus shell includes sophisticated integral
nanofacs and hybridized tissue components to create the “ultimate”
human form. They are notoriously difficult to create, with multiple
failure points in their construction, and provide a level of
performance that is more theoretically impressive than practically
useful for most purposes.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 18, Dexterity 18, Constitution 18

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Terminus is immune to conventional diseases
    and toxins, has a base Armor Class of 15, and grants 10 extra hit
    points to the soul operating it. A Terminus can tolerate any
    temperature found on Earth and can survive hard vacuum or airless
    conditions without difficulty for ten minutes. Cognitive
    improvements grant a +1 to either their Charisma, Intelligence, or
    Wisdom modifiers, the attribute chosen being alterable with five
    minutes of concentration. This bonus cannot increase the modifier
    above +2. Terminus shells auto-stabilize at zero hit points.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Expert operators gain a +1 bonus on all
    skill rolls and +2 on hit rolls. By accepting 2 System Strain as an
    Instant action, the user can gain a bonus turn of action in a round,
    taken at the end of the round after everyone else has acted. Only
    one bonus turn can be taken each round.


<a id="shell-uplift"></a>

## Uplift

A general name for a wide range of genetically uplifted animal forms,
some of these usually-humanoid shells are occupied by actual
cognitively-boosted animals, while others are used by souls that
prefer a more feral form. This form reflects an Uplift designed for a
large predator; other shells might be drawn from different types of
beasts, and might grant integral flight, aquatic functionality, or
other animal-derived perks.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 14, Dexterity 14, Constitution 14

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** Predator Uplifts are equipped with natural
    weapons equal to a Medium Advanced melee weapon and a base Armor
    Class of 13.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Experienced Uplift operators can bring out
    the subtle advantages of a bestial frame. One physical attribute
    appropriate to the Uplift type is improved to 18. Their base Move is
    improved from 10 to 15 meters. The shell now grants 10 bonus hit
    points.


<a id="shell-vision"></a>

## Vision

These humanoid shells are designed with an array of pheromones and
body harmonics designed to trigger instinctive responses in
human-cognitive viewers. Despite the exotic appearance of many of
them, these shells are almost invariably seen as remarkably beautiful
or imposing. The body harmonics required to produce this effect
sometimes come at a cost in durability, but social prowess is often
far more useful in a polity than a body's brute power. ***Attributes:***
Strength 12, Dexterity 14, Constitution 8

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** Visions improve the soul's Charisma modifier by
    +1, up to a maximum of +3. In addition, any social skill checks
    toward human minds gain a +1 bonus, or a +2 bonus if the interaction
    involves intimate physical contact.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Practiced Vision users can refine the
    shape's natural grace into superlative speed and precision,
    improving their Dexterity score to 18. By accepting 1 System Strain,
    forcing pheromone production and enacting nuanced imprinting
    gestures and motion patterns they can issue subtle commands to a
    specific organic human in their presence. The target must make a
    Mental saving throw or comply with any request that isn't
    particularly distasteful to them and won't take them more than a
    scene. This compulsion is almost impossible for most subjects to
    distinguish from simple personal persuasiveness on the Vision's
    part.


<a id="mechanical-shells"></a>

# Mechanical Shells

These shells are cheaper and more durable than standard organic
shells, but the alien nature of metal limbs and synthetic sensors make
them considerably less “comfortable” to most human minds. Most
operators have difficulty getting mechanical shells to respond with
the same effortless ease that organic shells offer, with extensive
supplementary support programming a necessity in most cases. This need
for specialized support tends to result in mechanical shells being
built more for specific purposes than the general utility of organic
shells.

Most human-based intellects have difficulty emotionally relating to
visibly inorganic mechanical shells. Unless specified otherwise, souls
in mechanical shells suffer a -1 penalty to all Charisma skill checks
except those related to intimidation.

Mechanical shells have no need for sleep, sustenance or human-miscible
environments and can operate anywhere a robot could survive. If
separated from a convenient source of local power, they require one
Type B power cell per week of operation. Mechanical shells suffer
damage and are repaired in the same way as VI robots.


<a id="shell-angel"></a>

## Angel

As a combination medic and repair shell, the Angel is designed to get
damaged shells back up and running, whether they're organic or
mechanical in nature. Most are humanoid in form, though often with
multiple smaller appendages for stim application and repairs.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** An Angel is equipped with an effectively
    inexhaustible medkit and an unending supply of Lift, Bezoar, and
    lazarus patch stims. It can very rapidly repair damaged adjacent
    mechanical shells, fixing up to the operating soul's level plus
    their Heal skill in lost hit points as a Main Action at the cost of
    one unit of spare parts. Salvage and synthesis units on the Angel
    allow it to create spare parts as part of this repair action; it can
    generate up to ten “free” units of spare parts per scene. It can
    remove the Badly Damaged quality from a shell with one hour of
    repair work. Angels have a base Armor Class of 13 and 5 extra hit
    points.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Veteran Angel operators can maximize the
    effectiveness of their repair functionality. They do not fail Heal
    skill checks to stabilize organic subjects, assuming a lazarus patch
    could save them. Damage repaired on mechanical shells with each
    action is doubled and damage healed by Lift stims is increased by an
    additional 1d8 points per stim. Repurposed injector units allow
    stims and mechanical repair to be applied at up to 30 meters
    distance, assuming the operator has a clear shot at their target.

<a id="shell-box"></a>

## Box

The humblest and cheapest of the standard shells used in most sectors,
the Box is little more than a basic soul core equipped with minimal
manipulatory appendages and sensor arrays. Boxes usually unfold into
generally humanoid shapes in order to better function in
human-designed environments, but there's nothing preventing habitats
of more exotic nature from building Boxes in less humanoid shapes.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 8, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Box is more difficult to casually damage than
    most organic shapes, and has a base Armor Class of 15.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Those forced to gain extensive experience in
    operating a standard Box learn how to cope with the limited sensory
    feedback and structural limits of the hull. Their Strength attribute
    becomes 14 and their Dexterity becomes 12, as well as gaining 10
    bonus hit points.


<a id="shell-falcon"></a>

## Falcon

These shells are usually entirely non-humanoid in shape, appearing as
flat discs or multi-jet platforms of roughly a meter's width, with
several manipulator appendages attached. Falcons have advanced
anti-grav tech embedded in them to allow for easier transit in
hazardous space environments or as quiet scouting units when remote
drones are impractical.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 8, Dexterity 14, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Falcon has a Move rate of 20 meters per
    action, and can silently fly or hover freely even in the absence of
    an atmosphere. It's barely strong enough to lift and carry one other
    human-sized shell in standard gravity but can do nothing else while
    carrying them. Falcons have advanced sensor arrays that allow them
    to observe objects up to two kilometers distant, ignore darkness,
    and avoid long-range penalties with any weapons they may be
    using. Falcons have a base Armor Class of 15 and 5 extra hit points.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** Falcon operators with extensive experience
    in the shell learn how to extend and alter the gravitic field the
    disc utilizes. They can remotely manipulate unattended objects or
    cooperative persons up to 30 meters distant as if using their own
    Strength. Facility with gravitic shields and sudden maneuver jinks
    also grant it a +3 Armor Class bonus and a bonus of 10 extra hit
    points instead of 5.


<a id="shell-jack"></a>

## Jack

A flexible and relatively cheap platform designed for technical work
in environments that would be difficult for an organic shell to
survive, the Jack is equipped with a wide range of integral tools.
Most are humanoid in outline, though many have several additional
manipulatory appendages or tendrils in order to aid in the repair of
complex devices.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Jack has a built-in postech toolkit and hand
    tools that can be used as the equivalent of Small Advanced melee
    weapons. It gains a +1 bonus to all Fix and Program skill checks,
    and has a durable structure with a base Armor Class of 15 and 10
    bonus hit points.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** An experienced Jack operator knows how to
    improvise with the shell's integral hardware. They can jury-rig any
    portable TL4 technology of 1 Encumbrance or less with a Main Action
    and one unit of spare parts, except for consumables such as power
    cells or stims. Items that require power are rigged with one cell's
    worth of energy. This jury-rigged tech only works for the rest of
    the scene. The Jack's improvised weaponry now counts as a Large
    Advanced melee weapon or a rifle with no ammunition requirements,
    either usable as needed.


<a id="shell-omen"></a>

## Omen

The Omen mechanical shell is meant for combat and combat alone. Most
are sufficiently humanoid to operate in human-oriented environments,
but none of them could ever be mistaken for a normal human being, with
their studding of weapons, reinforcement plates, and reactive armor.
Omens are often forbidden on space habitats due to their ready ability
to tear through most barriers.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 18, Dexterity 14, Constitution 14

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** An Omen's integral weaponry is equivalent to a
    Large Advanced melee weapon and a plasma projector that requires no
    ammunition. They gain +4 to hit with all attack rolls, +2 on all
    damage and Shock values, and have an effective base Armor Class of
    18 and 15 bonus hit points. An Omen's built-in cutting torches and
    ripper bars can cut through a standard interior hatch or reinforced
    door in five rounds and can bore through normal exterior ship
    plating or external hatches in five minutes. Its integral sensors
    allow it to operate in darkness at no penalty and it has lowgee
    microjets that allow it to fly at its normal Move rate in
    microgravity or less.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** The shell's Strength attribute bonus is
    treated as +3 and it becomes immune to Shock damage. Skilled Omen
    operators can run the system “hot” to improve damage output at the
    risk of progressively degrading its internal systems. Once per round
    as an On Turn action they can choose to accept 1d6 damage in order
    to attack twice with a single Main Action, targeting the same
    subject or splitting the attack between available targets. The
    overheating damage is applied after the attacks are rolled.


<a id="shell-sledge"></a>

## Sledge

A heavy industrial work shell, the Sledge is slow but extremely tough.
Most resemble gorillas or other hulking humanoid shapes, though some
are tracked or wheeled to save on construction complexity.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 18, Dexterity 8, Constitution 18

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Sledge is extraordinarily strong if it has
    time to carefully set its manipulators. If it has time to work, it
    can break through anything short of reinforced structural material
    at a rate of one meter every thirty seconds and can lift and
    manipulate up to two metric tons with the aid of gravitic
    stabilizers. It has a base Armor Class of 15, including its
    Dexterity penalty, and 15 extra hit points. A Sledge has onboard
    tools equivalent to a postech tool kit.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** The expert operator knows how to quickly
    engage the shell's strength actuators and can treat its effective
    Strength modifier as +3. When it moves, it can burst through any
    standard interior-grade wall or light external construction as part
    of its movement. Its effective hit point bonus is 25 instead of 15.


<a id="shell-synth"></a>

## Synth

Some mechanical shells are built to be almost indistinguishable from
more organic shapes, and the Synth is one such android form. A Synth
is indistinguishable from a human without a medical examination or
significant physical trauma to reveal its artificial workings. While a
normal human shape is the baseline for a Synth, it is possible to
build models with far more exotic and fanciful configurations that
still appear organic.

-   ***Attributes:*** Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 12

-   ***Basic Abilities:*** A Synth does not suffer the usual mechanical
    shell penalty on Charisma skill checks, and can pass in areas where
    overtly mechanical shells might draw unwelcome attention. Their base
    Armor Class is only 10, however. A Synth's artificial nature becomes
    obvious if it is reduced to zero hit points.

-   ***Affinity Abilities:*** A practiced Synth user can maximize their
    mechanical advantages, raising both Strength and Dexterity scores to
    14, and gains a bonus 5 hit points.


<a id="the-net-and-digital-shells"></a>

# The Net and Digital Shells

Most individual habitats and polities maintain a local ***Net***, a
network of digital connections and databases that can be accessed
anywhere in that same habitat or territory. Each Net is usually
carefully secured against any external access; it's possible to send
text messages or video between different Nets, but VR access, database
connections, or other more involved manipulations are impossible
without an inside agent in the target Net able to knock a hole in the
firewalls by hacking a comm.

Most Net use is instinctive and effortless to locals. They can call up
public information, send messages, and interact with control panels as
an On Turn action without any need to handle a physical interface.
Only completely and aggressively unmodified shells are without a basic
Net interface, a status usually reserved for prison shells and those
designed for deep-cover operations in polities that reject
modification. Even these shells can interact with the Net provided a
dataslab or similar physical interface is available.

Most automated systems can be operated via Net interface, and it's
often theoretically possible to hack them if Net access is
available. Many shells have “admin rights” over one or more systems,
allowing them to operate them automatically with no chance of
failure. Those with “root access” to a system can grant or remove
admin rights from other shells. These rights are specific to shells,
not souls, so if a shell is destroyed its inhabiting soul will need to
get these rights re-applied to their new corpus. Conversely, someone
who is able to steal an authorized shell or coerce its owner can use
it to subvert a system's security.

Each individual Net is made up of a vast number of real and virtual
“places”. It includes all the physical terrain claimed by the polity
that runs the Net, and also vast regions of purely virtual existence
within the local area's computing clusters. It's a largely trivial
exercise to observe public places, whether real or virtual, but
gaining access to private physical locations or restricted virtual
locations is a task that requires physical infiltration or competent
hacking. Many of the most important infrastructure locations or
highest-security virtual locations are physically disconnected from
the wider local Net, and require physical intrusion into specific
areas in order to hack them.

Most Nets are exclusive over a particular area of physical space, with
only one Net operating in any given location. Some crowded areas may
have more than one Net active, however, each one run by a different
polity or private group. Security-minded polities discourage this sort
of thing, as any Nets that physically overlap in coverage area allow
digital shells in one Net to operate in any others in the same
physical place. Such overlapping jurisdictions make for a hotbed of
hacking attempts, with shells based out of friendly Nets making
assaults on less-loved neighbors.


<a id="digital-shells"></a>

## Digital Shells

Digital shells are by far the cheapest and easiest shells to create,
costing only 10 Face at most and requiring nothing more than a
sufficiently advanced computing node and adequate power to run it.
When a person purchases a digital shell, they are actually just
acquiring rights to the local computing power necessary to instantiate
it. Habs with sufficient excess computing power can simply assign any
amount of it needed to run free digital shells.

Digital shells are extremely difficult to truly kill. If a shell is
destroyed, its computing node can reinstantiate it and its soul with
an hour's computation, bringing it back with all the memories it had
at the time of its destruction, albeit any programs or data files it
had in its “inventory” at the time are destroyed. To permanently kill
a digital shell, its computing node must be hacked or destroyed, a
process that usually requires gaining access to some of the
best-protected areas of a habitat.

Digital shells do not have physical attributes. Their hit points are
equal to the soul's unmodified hit points. Any damage to a soul is
repaired automatically after one hour without further trauma.


<a id="loci-and-systems"></a>

## Loci and Systems

A digital shell is an inhabitant of a single Net. Its soul is
supported by system hardware somewhere in the bowels of the machine,
but its awareness and focus, or its “Locus”, is restricted to physical
or virtual locations within the reach of that local Net. Usually, this
consists of a single space habitat or the territory on a planet under
the control of a single polity.

It's possible for a soul to transmit itself to a different Net in two
circumstances. If their home Net physically overlaps with another one,
they can operate in any region that overlaps. Lacking that, they can
transfer to an outside Net provided the soul has access to a digital
shell there and someone on the other side opens up a viable
transmission path for the soul. This process takes five minutes for a
local transmission on the same world or region of a solar system;
longer-distance interplanetary transmissions are impractical due to
comm lag. Once complete, the soul inhabits the destination shell on
the target Net and its original shell goes inert; the computing
hardware that would normally be supporting it is now supporting the
existence of the remote shell.

If someone cuts off the communication link between the Nets by undoing
the comm hack or destroying the communications hardware involved, the
interloping digital shell dies instantly and re-embodies in the shell
back at its original Net, memories intact but with any programs or
data files in its “inventory” destroyed and unrecoverable.

Optionally, the shell can hitch a physical ride in a “mindbox”, a
piece of computing hardware rated to fully support the soul. If their
allies can bring the mindbox into the target Net's territory, the
digital shell can operate natively in the proximate physical location,
as if it part of the target Net's normal population of digital shells.
The minibox provides all the necessary computing power to instantiate
the shell and let it operate inside the foreign Net's jurisdiction.

Once in a net, the digital shell can observe any public location
within the Net's reach. Most often this means a literally public
location: city streets, common hab corridors, and the like. Private
locations normally have spy scrubbers and observation locks that
prevent eavesdropping in the area. Note that an allied physical
shell's Net implants always count as public to a friendly digital
shell, allowing them to always see and observe what their friends are
doing even in private locations. Friends can shut down this access at
any time if they so desire.

Digital shells can monitor multiple feeds, but this requires about as
much attention as watching multiple viewscreens. They can monitor
numerous places for unusual activity, but they can only really focus
on one at a time. This focus is referred to as a digital shell's
***Locus***, the point at which they're paying attention and able to
influence Net-connected systems in the area.

To hack a system in a private location, it's often necessary for a
digital shell to send a physical ally close enough to get their Locus
into the right area. No physical connection is necessary; the Locus
just has to be in the same physical area as the target system. Some
Loci are purely virtual, “deep” regions of an internal computing
system that may require successful hacking to reach at all, or public
communal VR environments that any shell can focus on. Digital shells
may be necessary to get anywhere near these “places”.

To hack a system within the scope of a shell's Locus, the shell rolls
according to the usual hacking difficulties on page 54. The shell can
only maintain control as long as they can keep their Locus in the
area; while they can cripple a system or alter a database, they cannot
maintain active control over it once they lose access to the
area. Line shunts are not necessary or helpful in most transhuman
sectors; without an active digital shell to control a hack, the
system's innate defensive measures will overcome any persistent
influence. If intruders trip any alarms or any guardian digital shells
survive to raise an alert, hacks and database corruption might well be
discovered. If they execute the hack quietly enough, however, their
changes may never be noticed by the owners.

To complicate this task, other digital shells may be present with the
same Locus. If a hostile shell with admin privileges is present with
the same Locus, no hack can be successful until the enemy shell is
destroyed or incapacitated in digital combat. Thus, shell “guardians”
are often the biggest obstacle to hacking attempts, and would-be
interlopers must destroy them to succeed.

While it's theoretically possible for an organic or mechanical shell
to make a hacking attempt on a system with portable hacking hardware,
their “non-native” reflexes make this far more difficult. All of their
hacking difficulties are increased by +2 and they cannot engage in
digital combat, thus making it impossible for them to hack systems
with an active guardian.


<a id="digital-combat"></a>

# Digital Combat

When two or more digital shells engage in combat, the process is much
quicker than a conventional flesh-and-blood struggle. All combats are
resolved effectively instantaneously once engaged and all combatants
act simultaneously. A shell can drag any number of shells with the
same Locus into combat, forcing all of them to deal with it before
they can perform any other action. Intruders often do this in order to
stifle any guardians before they can give an alarm.

Digital shells lack physical attributes. Their rolled hit points are
not modified by their shells, and the damage they inflict is based on
their Program skill plus any special programs they may be deploying.

At the start of digital combat, all participants choose a target. Each
soul can only pick one target, but can be the target of any number of
hostile souls.

Each participant then picks an attack mode, whether to *Crush* their
opponent's shell, overloading its processing channels, *Muffle* the
shell, cutting off its data streams, or *Shear* the shell, selectively
corrupting critical sectors of the shell. A separate response is made
to each shell engaged with them in combat; thus, if three shells all
ganged up on a single target, the single target would pick one combat
mode for its chosen target, and then pick two more combat modes to
respond to the other two attackers. These modes are chosen secretly,
and revealed simultaneously once all are chosen.

Crush is beaten by Muffle, Muffle is beaten by Shear, and Shear is
beaten by Crush. If the same mode is chosen by both combatants, no
damage is inflicted to either. Once per combat, a PC with the Expert
class can turn a losing or tied comparison into a successful one.

If the attacker beats the defender, they inflict 1d6 damage on the
target, plus 1d6 per Program skill level; thus, 1d6 total at
Program-0, 2d6 total at Program-1, and so forth. If the defender beats
the attacker, no damage is inflicted. A shell can only inflict damage
on its chosen target; if it loses to the target but successfully beats
three other assailants that same turn, it inflicts no damage on them.

Some shells might be equipped with programs that allow them to do more
damage with particular combat modes, or resist harm from certain
modes, or have additional combat actions. Only one program can affect
each clash, with the chosen program noted at the same time the
combatant writes down their combat mode and revealed together with
their opponent.

Shells reduced to zero hit points are destroyed. The soul must be
re-instantiated in a new shell before it can act once more, a process
that requires an hour. Shells recover any lost hit points after an
hour without further injury.

Once combat begins in a Locus, it continues until all enemy
participants are either destroyed or have surrendered. A surrendered
shell is completely at the mercy of the assailant, and can be
destroyed, released, or rendered paralyzed and helpless for up to one
hour at the winner's discretion. Shells locked in combat cannot raise
alarms, alert allies, or do anything other than fight and make brief
communications with other involved combatants. Shells that have been
destroyed require a full hour to reconstitute themselves and re-embody
their souls.


<a id="digital-programs"></a>

## Digital Programs

Just as physical shells have equipment, so can digital shells carry
programs. Programs can be carried in a shell's virtual “inventory” or
left as virtual objects in storage at some Locus. A shell can carry a
number of programs equal to half their Intelligence, rounded down. A
soul must have the requisite minimum Program skill to use a given
program or else it's too complex or finicky for them to
operate. Programs can't cross Net borders without a friendly
gatekeeper on the far side. To move programs from one Net to another,
it's often necessary to download them into physical storage and
manually carry them into the new Net's area of operation before
allowing a friendly shell to upload them once more.

Programs can be duplicated easily, but this is a risky process. Each
duplication runs the risk of alerting the local Net's autonomic immune
system and allowing it to formulate a counter for the program, making
both copies worthless. To duplicate a program, the hacker must make an
Int/Program skill check at a difficulty of 9 plus the minimum Program
skill required to run it; on a success, they have two copies of it
now, while on a failure, both the original and the copy are
destroyed. If the local Net is “friendly” and fully under the control
of the hacker, there is no risk of this happening, though simply
belonging to the local polity rarely grants this level of digital
impunity. Thus, many hackers prefer to work in isolated habs where
they have full digital control over their environment.

Programs require a minimum Program skill to operate them, with the
more sophisticated programs requiring greater skill to implement. Only
one program can be run on any single round of digital combat, the
choice written down next to the attack mode being used before it is
revealed. Each program is listed with a usual Face cost to acquire a
copy from local suppliers.


<a id="common-digital-programs"></a>

## Common Digital Programs

Most of the following programs are available in almost any polity that
doesn't sharply restrict digital shells.

-   ***<a id="org564cbd1"></a> (Program-1):*** This program focuses the shell's offensive
    capabilities in a blinding flurry of digital attacks. Hostile shells
    rapidly acclimate to this offense, however, and it leaves the shell
    vulnerable to counterattacks. If Autofire is used in a round,
    inflict bonus damage equal to one automatically-successful attack
    using the current combat mode, even if that mode would normally fail
    against the target's response. For the rest of the combat, however,
    every attack against the operator is always considered successful,
    regardless of the combat mode outcome. It costs 40 Face to acquire a
    copy of this program.

-   ***<a id="org42ebf3b"></a> (Program-1):*** A special non-combat program designed
    for stealthy infiltration, an operator with the Clairvoyant program
    in their inventory can spend one round in a Locus before any
    existing digital guardians or security systems notice their
    presence. This does not allow them to reach Loci they couldn't
    normally reach, but it does let them skip away from a Locus before
    guardians can spot them. Once they leave a Locus, they can't gain
    this stealth benefit there again for another hour. It costs 20 Face
    to acquire a copy of this program.

-   ***<a id="orgd0c2f5b"></a> (Special):*** This is not an executable program, but
    instead an important data file crusted over with typical safeguards
    and anti-intrusion measures. Digital intelligences who need to
    handle critical data they've looted can treat the important files as
    a Database program in their inventory.

-   ***<a id="org6098d41"></a> (Program-1):*** An extremely dangerous program favored by
    veteran hackers who value speed over safety, Kamikaze automatically
    makes the operator's combat mode a success. However, it also makes
    any assailant's combat mode a success against them, in turn. Thus,
    in a two-party combat, both parties inflict damage on each other
    when Kamikaze is used. If the operator is being targeted by multiple
    hostiles, this program can result in rapid destruction. It costs 40
    Face to acquire a copy of this program.

-   ***<a id="org8ca9796"></a> (Variable):*** Available for Crush, Muffle, and Shear
    attack modes and existing in three ascending levels of
    sophistication, this program greatly augments the damage done by
    that attack mode. The operator adds twice the program's level to
    each die of damage inflicted by that attack mode type; thus, Crush
    Boost-2 adds +4 damage to each die rolled by a Crush attack. The
    program has a minimum skill required equal to its level, and costs
    10 Face per level to acquire a copy.

-   ***<a id="orgb9aaf36"></a> (Variable):*** The inverted, defensive equivalent of a
    Mode Boost program, this decreases each die of damage inflicted by
    that attack mode by twice its rating, ranging from -2 to -6
    points. Thus, Shear Shield-3 subtracts 6 points of damage from each
    die inflicted by Shear on the operator. This can reduce a die's
    damage to zero. The program has a minimum skill required equal to
    its level, and costs 10 Face per level to acquire a copy.

-   ***<a id="org50b5393"></a> (Program-0):*** A sophisticated utility program, the
    operator may use more than one program on a single attack. They may
    simultaneously run programs with total Program skill minimums equal
    to their Program skill. Thus, if they had Program-2 skill, they
    could run Kamikaze, which requires Program-1, and Crush Boost-1,
    which also requires Program-1. Only one Multithread program can be
    run at a time. It costs 40 Face to acquire a copy of this program.

-   ***<a id="org6fd0545"></a> (Program-1):*** The shell is hardened against all digital
    combat modes. Subtract twice the operator's Program skill from each
    die of incoming damage, down to a minimum of zero. Once Reinforce
    has reduced damage, however, it becomes inoperable for the rest of
    the combat. It costs 40 Face to acquire a copy of this program.

-   ***<a id="org167a244"></a> (Program-2):*** An operator who throws a smokebomb
    resolves the combat round. If they are still alive, they then
    immediately get one round to perform a hacking action, even if there
    are active guardians in the Locus. If successful, this hack cannot
    be countermanded by admin shells for 1d6 rounds. An operator can
    throw down a smokebomb only once per hour. It costs 60 Face to
    acquire a copy of this program.

-   ***<a id="orgff9d7c8"></a> (Special):*** A soul jar is not a program, per se, but the
    data necessary to instantiate a soul. For cases when a digital shell
    needs to get a person's soul data into or out of an area, it can be
    treated as a program in their virtual inventory, and will be lost if
    they are “killed”.

-   ***<a id="orga632ea8"></a> (Program-0):*** This dangerous program allows a shell to
    damage multiple assailants at the risk of incurring greater
    harm. When engaging more than one enemy, success in an attack mode
    comparison allows the user to harm the loser, no matter how many are
    engaging them. If an enemy successfully harms them that round,
    however, they suffer an additional 1d6 damage from the attack.

-   ***<a id="orgbf276ae"></a> (Program-1):*** Hostile computing resources are siphoned to
    repair a damaged digital shell. Any damage the operator inflicts
    this round heals half as much in hit point damage they have
    suffered, rounded up. It costs 40 Face to acquire a copy of this
    program.


<a id="transhuman-polities"></a>

# Transhuman Polities

Even in soft transhuman sectors, conventional struggles over wealth
and resources are rare. It is simply too easy to create mere physical
objects, especially if grails can transmute base elements into
whatever material is needed. Instead, struggles tend to revolve around
ideological viewpoints, focusing on beliefs and creeds that coalesce
in the form of ***polities***.

A polity is simply a group of people dedicated to particular
principles. They may be eager enthusiasts bent on shedding their
organic forms, or radical human traditionalists, or religious zealots
who seek new forms in which to serve God. They might exist to uphold a
tradition of human culture or art, or to explore a specific new mode
of being and the possibilities it unlocks. Others seek a radical
reevaluation of human morality, reconsidering what it means to be
virtuous in a world where human souls can be duplicated and edited at
a whim. Some polities might be jealously exclusive in their
membership, while others tolerate their members belonging to other
polities as well, so long as their goals are not in conflict.

The more isolated these groups are from the harsh necessities of
mundane practicality, the more drastic their beliefs tend to be. The
need to constantly contend with an indifferent cosmos just to extract
necessary resources for survival tends to dampen the more fanciful
flights of ideological creativity.

Once these limits are broken by the grails, there is much less to
constrain a vision of future existence. The conflicts between these
polities provide adventure seeds in a transhuman campaign, with PCs
supporting some against others.


<a id="the-work-of-paradise"></a>

## The Work of Paradise

Transhuman polities almost all afford their devotees with a basic
level of sustenance well in advance of any modern society. Even
personal grails are sufficient to manufacture the necessary resources
and expert-system automation needed to provide an ordinary polity
member with everything they might need in the way of food, shelter,
entertainment, and medical care. While space may be limited in a
deep-space habitat, and goods and services specific to human providers
might still be in short supply, the average polity member may go their
entire indefinite life without knowing a single moment of true hunger,
privation, or want.

One thing the grails cannot provide, however, is a meaning for these
prolonged lives. Many transhumans spend years or even decades sunk
into aimless hedonism, time-killing digital entertainments, or a
simple unthinking repetition of daily existence. Sooner or later,
however, most transhumans find a burning need for some sense of
*purpose* to their lives, some reason for existence beyond
increasingly-tedious amusements and ever-more-stale novelties of
experience. The polities provide this meaning to their adherents.

The polities are about something that is important, even important
enough to cost their most dedicated followers their indefinite lives.
Pursuing this ideal promises its believers a sense of meaning and
significance that the ten-thousandth virtual orgy or twentieth
orbital-insertion suicide dive can't provide. For those transhumans
who can no longer bring themselves to believe in any power higher than
their own will, these polity ideals act as a surrogate religion.


<a id="creating-polities"></a>

## Creating Polities

When building a polity, a GM should start with one or two rolls on the
adjacent table to determine what ideal drives the heart of the
polity. These ideals are simply examples, but each one indicates the
kind of action the polity pursues and the kind of activity they find
hateful. If the polity is to be useful in the game, it needs to want
things and detest things, and the interaction of these goals with the
rest of the campaign setting will form the seeds of future
adventures. If more than one ideal is used, you can synthesize them
together, or just place one as more important than the other.

When you have the polity's core ideal defined, take a moment to think
of a paragraph-sized pitch for the polity's ideology. Why would a
transhuman want to be part of this polity? Are they born into it,
assuming it still uses organic reproduction? Is it offering them some
magnificent goal to fire the imagination? Is it promising to protect
them from some threat to their indefinite happiness? If you can't come
up with a brief, succinct reason for someone to join the polity, the
players are apt to be mystified by its appeal as well.

Decide how much influence the polity has in the campaign. Do they
control a full star system, or are they a niche group in deep-space
habitats? Are they widespread in other regions? Pick at least one
other polity to be a rival to it, and perhaps one other to be a
sympathetic ally. Write a sentence about each describing the current
tenor of their relationship.

All told, you'll probably need at least five polities in your
campaign, one of which should be moderate and pragmatic enough to
serve as a good default polity for PCs who don't want to get involved
in the more dramatic ideologies. Aside from these major polities,
there are likely dozens or hundreds more with at least a decent
cluster of space habs under their control, and you should feel free to
let players come up with them as part of their PC backgrounds. You
might write up major polities as Factions and reskin assets
accordingly.

These polities are going to be the patrons, enemies, and backdrops for
your campaign. While a few patently horrible groups always have a
place in a campaign, many of them should be ambiguous enough in their
ideals that your players will at least be able to entertain the idea
of cooperating with their goals.

# One-Roll Polity Missions

While the conventional adventure seeds earlier in this book can work
fine for building a transhuman adventure, these tables offer some more
genre-specific cues for building the kind of jobs that polities often
need to hire PCs to execute.

First figure out the general direction of the polity's interest and
identify the thing that's interesting them. The basic nature of the
mission reveals what it is the polity needs the PCs to accomplish,
while the major difficulty indicates the likely-obvious main problem
with achieving the desired end, though other problems are likely to be
part of it as well. One or more additional rolls on the transhuman
twist table can suggest other plot twists or genre-appropriate
elements to throw into the adventure.

<a id="polity-mission-rewards"></a>

# Polity Mission Rewards

Many of the adventures a party will have in a transhuman campaign will
revolve around doing work for one or more polities, either the groups
that the PCs are aligned with or simply those outside organizations
that are offering worthwhile rewards. The mission payment tends to be
roughly the same in both cases, as the gratitude of a polity toward a
loyal member serves much the same practical purpose as the indebted
obligation of an outside patron.

The rewards offered by polities to capable operatives are extensive,
but the jobs they need done are not the standard sort of
reactor-cleaning jobs that any low-ranking polity member could manage.
The jobs offered by polity leadership cadres are dangerous, difficult,
and often must be deniable. Survival is by no means assured, and in
some cases a suicide mission might be an assumed part of the work,
with reinstantation of a soul in a new shell provided as part of the
fee.

The pay a polity offers will depend on its own size and the importance
of the work. Every measure of Face they offer is the equivalent of so
much grail time or so much work by polity members, and small groups
just don't have the grails or membership to support huge payments,
even if Face itself is a somewhat notional resource. The rewards
offered here are baseline for a major polity with access to at least
one major grail. Smaller groups can likely offer only half as much, or
even less.

Reward totals are given in Face here, but if you're running a campaign
where credits are still in use, you can multiply the Face rewards by
50 to get the equivalent amount of credits they would likely offer.

Rewards are per-party, divided evenly amongst the PCs, and often
scaled to the highest PC's level. The more respected and experienced
the mercenary or member, the more their help is worth.


<a id="simple-jobs"></a>

## Simple Jobs

Go someplace relatively nearby and kill someone, destroy something, or
collect something. Targets are not expected to have any defenses
sufficient to stop a professional group, though ugly surprises do
happen. Performing this act is not expected to bring particular heat
down on the group or have lasting negative consequences with their
relationship with other significant polity groups. This work rewards
100 Face/level.


<a id="dangerous-jobs"></a>

## Dangerous Jobs

As a simple job, but there's reason to believe that the target may
have protection or environmental difficulties that would possibly
result in the death of even a capable and professional group. This
level of reward is also offered for simple jobs that might incur the
displeasure of a major polity against the PCs who perform it. The work
rewards 200 Face/level.


<a id="complicated-jobs"></a>

## Complicated Jobs

The polity needs something done, but isn't entirely sure how to
accomplish it. The PCs need to go someplace and use their own
ingenuity and understanding of the situation to bring about the
outcome desired by their patron. Even when these jobs appear to be
relatively safe, they pay well because they require a great deal of
initiative and personal judgment from the operatives. Any group
capable of regular performance of these tasks will be able to live in
the transhuman equivalent of luxury, with large amounts of personal
space, numerous sapient servants or companions, and a wide selection
of shells to use as they desire. Such jobs usually pay 500 Face/level.


<a id="veteran-jobs"></a>

## Veteran Jobs

At this level of work, the operatives are no longer run-of-the-mill
mercenaries or standard polity enforcers, but the proven experts at
their trade who are sought by employers throughout the transhuman
sector. Missions for veteran operatives tend to be matters of
significant importance to the polity as a whole, with opposition too
heavy or too skilled to be overcome by any ordinary agent. Often the
polity sees no way to succeed at the job, but trusts that experts will
somehow figure out a solution. Up to 10,000 Face/level are regularly
extended to groups capable of this work.


<a id="elite-jobs"></a>

## Elite Jobs

Something critically important needs to be done, and the polity can't
afford to have things go wrong. At this level, they're only giving the
work to people who have a demonstrated track record of success, but
they're also extremely flexible about the remuneration they'll
offer. Often, as much as 100,000 Face/level worth of goods or services
will be extended to PCs, or equivalent resources that already exist
will be signed over to PC ownership or placed at their regular
disposal.


<a id="critical-jobs"></a>

## Critical Jobs

These are tasks where failure threatens vital polity resources,
personnel, or the basic survival of the group. The leadership is
unlikely to give this work to anyone but the most reliable, proven
members or allied mercenaries, but they will pay almost anything for
successful completion. Essentially, the PCs tell the polity what they
want, and if the polity can actually give it to them, they get it. Of
course, if they fail the polity may not be in much of a condition to
do anything.

# SPACE MAGIC

Any reader of this game is likely aware of dozens of other old-school
game systems that have magic-using character classes and a wealth of
arcane sorcery. While many groups will be perfectly happy to stick
with traditional sci-fi tropes, some groups prefer a little more
wizardry in their stellar endeavors, and so this section provides you
with guidelines for integrating existing old-school spells and magic
use into a ***Stars Without Number*** campaign.

Particularly adventurous groups might go so far as to use ***Stars
Without Number*** as the chassis for a straight-up fantasy game, using
the Warrior and Expert classes to represent doughty fighters and
cunning thieves, and the additional classes in this section serving as
more sorcerously-inclined heroes.


<a id="molding-your-magic"></a>

## Molding Your Magic

The first step in including these rules is for the GM to decide just
what kind of magic she wants to include in her campaign. She might
decide to simply include the magic-user and cleric spell lists from
***Labyrinth Lord***, or import only the magic-user spells from
***Lamentations of the Flame Princess***, or perhaps devise a race of
sense-warping aliens who use the illusionist spell lists from an early
edition of one of TSR's famed games. Particularly industrious or
inspired GMs might choose spells from half a dozen different sources
and compile them all into a particular list suitable for their game.

A cursory examination of these other OSR games will show that almost
all of them divide their spells into multiple “levels” of increasing
power, usually ranging from level 1 to level 9. As a general rule of
thumb, you probably don't want to include spells higher than level 5
in your campaign. Beyond that power level, magically-gifted PCs start
to have a degree of personal prowess that's drastically out of scale
with non-arcane heroes. It may be possible to enact these mighty
enchantments through complex rituals, advanced supporting technology,
or other roundabout means, but they should not normally be powers at
the ready disposal of PCs.

When you're picking spells for your campaign, your main focus should
be on your personal group of players. It's not necessary to imagine
every possible sub-variety of sorcery in your personal cosmos, or to
spend hours painstakingly crafting a dozen different schools of
magical adepts. It probably isn't even necessary to worry about the
spell lists beyond level 2 or 3. Your job is to make sure that the
magic fits with your campaign and provides options that are likely to
interest your players. Don't hesitate to straightout ask your group if
anyone wants to play a magically-gifted hero, and if so, the kind of
magic they'd be most interested in having. If you give yourself some
warning time, you'll have enough leisure to put together a basic
arcane class or two that fits your group's needs.

Start by creating one or more spell lists for the classes provided in
this section. The Arcanist class should have a single broad spell list
that its practitioners all draw from, while the Magister class might
have multiple spell lists for different magical traditions. A Magister
can draw from only one of these lists, representing the particular
tradition they belong to. If you want to save yourself effort, you
might make up several Magister spell lists and then just declare that
an Arcanist can learn spells from any of them.

Adepts are a special case, and are meant to represent magical
traditions that focus on personal empowerment and alteration. Most
often, you'll simply be taking an old-school class with multiple
intrinsic magical powers and stripping it for parts to customize your
own Adept classes.


<a id="the-magic-skill"></a>

## The Magic Skill

In campaigns where sorcery is a matter of general concern, a new skill
is added to the list. ***Magic*** is the skill related to both academic
and practical use of sorcery. Whenever a spellcaster attempts to
puzzle out some arcane mystery or use their spells in a way that seems
both plausible and risky, a Magic skill check can be
required. Intelligence is the attribute that usually modifies such a
roll, though almost any attribute might be used for certain situations
or magical traditions.

For spells that require a hit roll to connect, the caster may use
their Magic skill as their combat skill, usually adding their
Intelligence or Dexterity modifier as well depending on whether the
attack relies more on careful targeting or nimble hands.

Whenever a PC rolls or picks the Know skill as part of their
background, focus bonus skills, or other picks, they may instead
choose the Magic skill. A PC does not have to have magical abilities
to understand the theory and technical details of sorcery, though
their ability to employ their knowledge might be limited.

In some campaigns, GMs will prefer to split the Magic skill up even
further, perhaps giving specific skills to each Magister school, or
dividing different magical traditions into different skills. While
this is a feasible choice, a GM should be careful not to parse things
too finely, and should allow cross-skill use in most magical
situations.

Importantly, a spellcaster cannot cast a spell of a level higher than
their Magic skill plus one, even if their character level would
normally allow them to cast such potent enchantments. A magic-user
needs to understand the basic theory and practice of their magic
before they can employ it effectively. This limit does not apply to
Adepts, who often have no magical education at all, and it may also
not apply to other magical traditions that owe more to lineage or
random genius than focused education.


<a id="spells-and-invocations"></a>

## Spells and Invocations

The Arcanist and Magister classes listed below cast spells. A GM can
pick appropriate spells for their lists from their old-school games of
choice, with the Arcanist intended to be a generalist magic-user who
can alter their prepared spells to meet an anticipated situation, and
the Magister meant to be a student of a particular magical tradition
that grants them less breadth but an easier time accessing the full
scope of their powers. For these classes you can lift spells directly
from your sources to make their spell lists, and you usually don't
have to change anything about the spells.

The Adept class, on the other hand, is meant to emulate a particular
type of magical adept who has a very restricted range of abilities
that are very easy for them to invoke. Invocations emulate intrinsic
magical powers and special gifts that can't be effectively interrupted
and require no special preparation to employ.

The easiest way to create an Adept's invocations is to just look at an
existing old-school character class with intrinsic magical abilities.
They'll usually get special powers at certain levels, or boosted
attack damage, or some other natural class ability. Each of those can
be treated as an invocation. Powers that require activation should be
assigned an action type, either Main Action, On Turn, or Instant
depending on how long it seems it should take to activate the ability,
while flat bonuses should be invocations that are constantly in
effect.

You're inevitably going to have to eyeball the final result a little
and apply tweaks and adjustments to make sure the resultant Adept
tradition is a suitable fit to your campaign. Just work with the
player who's going to have the PC to make something acceptable, as you
don't have to balance things for random other people.


<a id="casting-magic"></a>

## Casting Magic

In science-fantasy campaigns, magic is divided between ***spells*** and
***invocations***. Spells are arcane formulae, divine prayers, lengthy
rituals, and all other magic-creating procedures that tend to take
some time and undisturbed action in order to trigger. Invocations are
innate powers or gifts, either gained through long practice, granted
via occult pacts, or simply intrinsic to the bloodline of the bearer.
Invocations require much less effort to trigger, but their bearers
tend to be much less flexible in their powers than spellcasters.

To cast a spell, the spellcaster must declare their intent to cast a
spell at the very start of the round, before any group has acted, and
they must specify *which* spell they intend to cast. Their efforts to
begin casting will begin immediately. Most spellcasting is blatantly
obvious, involving arcane gestures, stentorian incantations, and
occasional visible discharges of coalescing energy. Most combatants in
a culture where magic exists will recognize spellcasting immediately,
though it is usually impossible to tell *what* spell the spellcaster
is trying to cast. A magic-user cannot normally cast any spells if
their hands are restrained or their mouth is gagged.

Completing the spell requires a Main Action from the caster, performed
during their normal turn of action during the round. They may choose
details of targeting and specific effects at the moment they cast they
spell. If they decide that they really don't want to cast the spell
after all, they lose their Main Action but will not waste the spell or
the power used to fuel it. If the caster suffers so much as a single
hit point of damage before they can complete the spell, however, it
and their Main Action for the turn are both lost. The spell still
counts against any casting maximums for the day, but it fizzles away
uselessly.

Invocations are much quicker and easier to cast than spells, and
largely impossible to interrupt. Most invocations require a Main
Action to cast, but they do not require announcement at the start of
the turn and they cannot be interrupted by damage. Other invocations
can be used as an Instant or On Turn action, or they might be
constantly in effect once acquired.


<a id="learning-spells-and-invocations"></a>

## Learning Spells and Invocations

Most spells require either a teacher or a magically-charged
instruction device in order to impart its secrets. A mere text file
might be able to describe what a spell does, but without a
magically-imbued training object for a spellcaster to study, the
spell's true patterns of energy and meaning are impossible to discern.
Traditionally, these training objects take the shape of physical
books, often called “grimoires”, as the traditional methods of energy
imprinting commonly focus on written codices.

Without a grimoire or a willing teacher, a spellcaster cannot learn or
use a given spell, even if it appears on the spell list for their
class. If the spell does not appear on their class spell list, they
cannot learn it even with access to a teacher or grimoire. It simply
is too far outside the scope of their magical education.

Learning a spell from a teacher requires one day per level of the
spell. Learning it from a magically-imbued object requires one week
per spell level. This training can be interrupted and resumed with no
ill effects, but a spellcaster can learn only one spell at a
time. Most Magisters can expect to be taught the spells of their
tradition by a cooperative senior member of their order as they
advance in level, though they might be called upon to perform a
service for the tradition in order to “prove their worthiness” to
receive the knowledge. Arcanists have a less certain path forward, and
must usually either find grimoires or convince other spellcasters to
train them, often for a substantial fee in credits or service. In the
absence of some other requirement, and assuming a willing teacher can
be found, such tutoring usually costs five hundred credits for a first
level spell, doubled for each ensuing spell level.

Only Arcanists and Magisters can learn spells. Adepts are taught their
invocations as part of their training and gradual maturation, and gain
their abilities automatically as they advance in experience.


<a id="the-arcanist"></a>

## The Arcanist

A purveyor of mystical secrets and a relentless scholar of the
unknown, the Arcanist is meant to represent a magic-user with a broad
grasp of arcane principles and a catholic view toward magical
theory. Arcanists sometimes form groups of like-minded researchers,
but their individuality and idiosyncratic academic views often makes
it difficult for them to work closely together.


<a id="arcanist-spellcasting"></a>

## Arcanist Spellcasting

Arcanists all share the same spell list. At first level, they may pick
a number of first level spells from this list equal to two plus their
Intelligence modifier. They begin knowing these spells and may prepare
their allowed spells per day from them. They may learn new spells as
the opportunity arises, but they cannot learn a spell that is not on
the Arcanist list or that is a higher level than they can actually
cast. There is no limit to the number of spells an Arcanist can learn
save for the need to find a teacher or grimoire from which to learn
them.

An Arcanist must prepare their spells before casting them. Such
preparation requires an hour of undisturbed meditation, arcane
exercises, and calculation, and can only be done once per day. The
number of spells an Arcanist can have prepared at any one time depends
on their character level; a novice Arcanist can prepare only a single
first level spell, while a master can have a dozen different
incantations ready for use. The adjacent table lists the number of
spells of each level that the Arcanist can prepare each day.

An Arcanist may fill a higher-level slot with a lower-level spell if
they wish, such as using a second level spell slot to prepare a first
level spell. Arcanists may also prepare multiple “copies” of a spell
they expect to see heavy use, preparing the same spell multiple times
in multiple slots.

When an Arcanist casts a spell, it is discharged and must be prepared
again before it can be used again. If they have multiple copies of a
spell prepared, they can continue to use it until they run dry of
available incantations. Suffering hit point damage before they can
successfully complete casting a spell also costs them the spell, as it
fizzles uselessly and is lost for the day.


<a id="arcanist-class-abilities"></a>

## Arcanist Class Abilities

Arcanists spend so much time in scholarly study that they lack the
resilience of more active heroes. Their hit points are rolled as 1d6-1
each level, plus their Constitution modifier. Each die's total cannot
be less than 1, even with the penalty.

Arcanists spend very little time mastering mundane weaponry. Their
base attack bonus is equal to their level divided by five, rounded
down. Thus, at first level, it's +0, and doesn't increase to +1 until
level five, and +2 at level ten.

Spellcasting requires the dexterous manipulation of esoteric energy
flows that are hindered by cumbersome armor and exotic materials. If
the Arcanist is wearing powered armor, including vestimentums, or
armor with an Encumbrance value higher than zero, they cannot
effectively cast spells, nor can they do so if their hands are bound
or they are gagged.

Arcanists may learn two new spells from the Arcanist spell list from
any level they are capable of casting each time they advance a level,
reflecting their own research and study. They begin play knowing two
first level spells, plus their Intelligence modifier.

Arcanists may choose their foci from the arcane focus list in this
section, and may choose one additional bonus arcane focus at first
level.

Arcanists gain Magic as a bonus skill. If the Magic skill is split up
into multiple sub-skills in this campaign, they can pick one of them
for a bonus skill instead.


<a id="partial-arcanist-abilities"></a>

## Partial Arcanist Abilities

Some characters may wish to only dabble in an Arcanist's arts,
selecting the Partial Arcanist class option as an Adventurer. Heroes
who choose this option gain the following traits.

Partial Arcanists suffer a -1 penalty on all hit point dice they roll.
Thus, a Partial Expert/Partial Arcanist would roll 1d6-1 for their hit
points each level, while a Partial Warrior/Partial Arcanist would roll
1d6+1.

Partial Arcanists suffer a -1 penalty on their base attack bonus, as
calculated by their other partial class. This penalty cannot reduce
the hero's base attack bonus below +0. If their other partial class is
Magister, their attack bonus is +0 at first level, +1 at fifth level,
and +2 at tenth level.

Partial Arcanists can learn and prepare Arcanist spells as if an
Arcanist of half their level, rounded up. For casting purposes, they
are treated as their full level; thus, if a spell does 1d6 points of
damage per caster level, a 5th level Partial Arcanist does 5d6 damage
with it.

Partial Arcanists are as limited as any other Arcanist when it comes
to casting spells in heavy armor. While wearing powered armor, or any
other armor with an Encumbrance value higher than zero, they cannot
effectively cast Arcanist spells.

Partial Arcanists may learn one new spell from the Arcanist spell list
from any level they are capable of casting each time they advance a
level, representing the fruits of their private research.

Partial Arcanists can choose arcane foci with their allowed focus
picks. They do not gain the bonus arcane focus that a full Arcanist
gets.

Partial Arcanists gain Magic as a bonus skill. If the Magic skill is
split up into multiple sub-skills in this campaign, they can pick one
of them for a bonus skill instead.

The entries list the number of spells an Arcanist can prepare each day
of a given spell level. There is no limit to the number of spells an
Arcanist can learn at each level, assuming a source is found for them.


<a id="the-magister"></a>

## The Magister

A studious follower of a particular magical tradition or sorcerous
order, the Magister is heir to uncounted centuries of arcane learning
and focused erudition. While Magisters do not have the broad magical
knowledge of an Arcanist, their focused study allows them more
flexibility in employing their spells, and less need to prepare
beforehand.


<a id="magister-spellcasting"></a>

## Magister Spellcasting

Unlike Arcanists, Magisters focus on a restricted set of sorceries,
and become intimately familiar with a relatively small number of
spells. Their deep familiarity with these spells allows them to cast
them without prior preparation, but it also prevents them from easily
learning new spells or changing their existing list.

At first level, a Magister picks two first level spells from their
allowed list. Each time they advance a level, they may learn
additional spells from their list as given by the Magister spell
table. Each time they advance an experience level, they may swap out
up to two of their existing spells for different picks of the same
spell levels. A Magister cannot learn new spells outside this
progression. If he wants to exchange a known spell for a different one
of the same level, beyond the two swaps granted by advancement each
level, he must spend three months of study to exchange a single
spell. It is assumed that a Magister can pick from any of the spells
on their school's spell list unless they are in exceptionally bad odor
with their fellows.

A Magister may cast their spells a certain number of times per day
depending on their level. At first level, for example, they may cast a
first level spell thrice per day. This spell may be from any of the
first level spells they know, and it is not necessary for them to
specifically prepare the spell as an Arcanist does. As they advance in
power, they are able to cast more and more spells each day from higher
levels of incantation. A Magister can cast a lower-level spell with a
higher-level slot if they so require, but this does not augment the
spell or make it more effective.

If a Magister suffers damage before they can successfully complete the
casting of a spell, the magical energy discharges harmlessly and the
spell slot is wasted. They can attempt to cast the spell again next
round if they still have available slots for that level.


<a id="magister-class-abilities"></a>

## Magister Class Abilities

Magisters have the exact same class abilities and limitations as an
Arcanist, save for their special rules for learning and casting
spells. In campaigns where the Magic skill is split into multiple
subskills, they have the sub-skill appropriate to their school as a
bonus instead of Magic.


<a id="partial-magister-abilities"></a>

## Partial Magister Abilities

A Partial Magister uses the exact same rules as a Partial Arcanist,
except that they cast spells from their Magister spell list, and may
learn them as if a Magister of half their character level, rounded
up. If a hero chooses to be a Partial Arcanist/Partial Magister, they
keep their spell lists separate; just because the hero knows a spell
as an Arcanist doesn't mean that they may cast it with Magister spell
slots. The same separation applies to their available spell castings
per day.

Entries list the total spells known each level followed by the spells
castable each day. Thus, at second level, a Magister knows two
first-level spells, and may cast any combination of them up to four
times a day.


<a id="the-adept"></a>

## The Adept

The Adept is the catch-all class for those heroes with intrinsic
magical abilities that aren't really spells, but are clearly
supernatural in nature. Adepts can vary wildly in their abilities;
some might have incredible powers of bodily control, others might have
a set of specific elemental abilities they can invoke, while still
others might be able to invoke specific magical powers with a freedom
and regularity even a Magister cannot match.

The Adept class is designed as a framework to allow a GM to bring in
classes from other old-school games that rely on special abilities
gained as a hero advances in character levels. These classes usually
have a few basic powers at first level, and then gain more special
abilities as they advance. It's likely that any importing will require
some tweaking and adjustment on the GM's part, but this class can be
used as a “container” to help organize these esoteric gifts.

When importing Adept traditions, be careful not to devalue the worth
of other classes. A combat-focused Adept should be about as good as a
Warrior, rather than superior to one, and an Adept focused on stealth
should not be universally superior to an Expert cat burglar. The
importance of this will vary with the PC makeup of your group. If you
have no other Warriors in the party, for instance, then you don't have
to be so careful about not stepping on their role.


<a id="adept-class-abilities"></a>

## Adept Class Abilities

Adepts roll 1d6 for their hit points each level, modified by
Constitution.

Adepts have a base attack bonus equal to half their level, rounded
down. Thus, it's +0 at first level. Specific Adept traditions may give
bonuses to this.

Adepts gain the special abilities of their chosen tradition. Often,
some of these are obtained automatically at first level, while others
are gained as the hero advances in experience. The GM may choose to
adjust the timing of these abilities to smooth out progression.

Adept abilities are invocations. Even when they require a Main Action
to activate, they cannot be interrupted by damage. Adept abilities may
be used as often as the specific ability allows; some have a limit of
so many uses per day, while others might be constantly in effect.

Adepts may choose to pick their beginning and any further earned foci
from the arcane focus list in this section, though foci that have to
do with spellcasting are inapplicable to them.


<a id="partial-adept-abilities"></a>

## Partial Adept Abilities

Partial Adepts gain the special abilities of their chosen tradition as
if they had an Adept level of half their character level, rounded
up. Where these abilities are influenced by character level, the
hero's full level is applied. Thus, if an intrinsic ability gave them
a +1 Armor Class bonus per level, a 5th level Partial Adept would gain
a +5 bonus to their AC.

Note that some Adept traditions involve granting a hero a powerful
base ability at first level that is then further elaborated or
expanded as they advance. This type of tradition may not be suitable
for a Partial Adept, or the GM may have to clip back the base ability
and only give the rest of it back as the PC advances in level.

Partial Adepts may choose to pick their beginning and any further
earned foci from the arcane focus list in this section, though foci
that have to do with spellcasting are inapplicable to them.


<a id="the-incandescent-order"></a>

## The Incandescent Order

As an example of an Adept class, the Incandescent Order wields the
“power of the Glow” as their inner spiritual purity made manifest
through light. The theocratic ruling institution of several remote
star systems, the Order is currently divided between the Exultants,
who believe that the gift of the Glow is a sign of absolute spiritual
authority over less-gifted sentients, and the Abstainers, who believe
that a Glow-gifted leader can still fall into serious acts of sin.

The two factions are nominally at peace, but a vicious secret war is
waged between them over ultimate control over Order space and the
Radiant Hierarchy that rules it. Losers of this religious debate and
those disillusioned with the conflict have been forced to flee Order
space for more distant worlds, bringing their discipline with them.

Any trained adept of the Order can identify a potential acolyte's Glow
potential with a few weeks of training. Most people have no ability to
wield it whatsoever, and some have only a limited gift, but a few can
be taught to become full priests of the light. The education usually
requires four or five years to set a novice on the path to eventual
mastery.

The Order itself is philosophically devoted to the Holy Light, the
radiance of truth, justice, and purity that the Light embodies. Those
who die for the cause will know the eternity happiness of radiant
truth, while the wicked will be cast forever into the Dark Hells of
ignorance and confusion. The Exultants insist that anyone who wields
the Glow can only temporarily be confused by sin, while the Abstainers
view the Glow merely as one more tool with which to serve the Light.


<a id="class-abilities-3"></a>

## Class Abilities

Order Adepts use the normal class abilities for Adepts except as noted
below.

Order Adepts gain Glow as a bonus skill. Glow is used to control and
apply the powers of the Order, and may be used as a combat skill for
Glow-based attacks.

Gain Order Effort equal to one plus their Glow skill plus the highest
of their Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. Order Effort works
much like a psychic's Effort, being Committed and recovered in the
same way, and is used to fuel Order powers. Order Effort and Psychic
Effort are tracked separately.

Order Adepts have a base attack bonus equal to half their character
level, rounded down. At first and fifth level, the adept gains a
cumulative +1 bonus to their base attack bonus. Thus, at first level
their attack bonus would be +1, and at fifth level it would be +4.

Adepts gain special Order Glow abilities at the levels listed below.


<a id="partial-class-abilities"></a>

## Partial Class Abilities

Partial Order Adepts use the Partial Adept rules as usual, save for
those listed below.

Partial adepts gain Glow as a bonus skill, just as full Order members
do.

Partial adepts have Order Effort equal to one plus half their Glow
skill, rounded up. They do not add their Wisdom or Charisma attribute
modifiers to this total.

Partial adepts gain Order powers as if they were half their full
character level, rounded up. They may use these powers at their full
character level. Thus, a first level partial Order adept has the 1st
level Order power. At third level, they gain the 2nd level Order
power, and so forth. They would use these abilities as a character of
their level, so a fourth level Partial Order Adept does 1d10 damage
with *The Light Within*.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow"></a>

## Powers of the Glow


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-the-light-within"></a>

### The Light Within     :level_1:

Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While Committed, you may radiate
light up to a 20-meter radius, project bolts of light doing 1d6 damage
up to 50 meters away, and ignore up to your character level in hit
points of laser damage from any given attack. At fourth level the
damage of these bolts increases to 1d10, and at seventh level they
become 2d6. Their attack rolls use the Glow skill and Dexterity
modifiers for combat purposes.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-the-light-without"></a>

### The Light Without     :level_2:

Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. Conjure a purely
visual illusion within 60 meters, the image occupying no more than
five meters' radius. The image appears perfectly realistic but is
intangible and soundless. The illusion lasts for the rest of the
scene; you can control it with a Move action, causing it to move or
changing its location. Invisibility is not an illusion, though you can
create the image of an opaque object in front of something.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-visual-interdict"></a>

### Visual Interdict     :level_3:

Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. You become invisible
for the rest of the scene and immune to laser weaponry or laser
tripwires. This invisibility breaks if you make an attack or other
violent motion. Attacks from invisible ambush grant +4 to hit and
damage, but do not usually count as Execution Attacks from page 52
unless the other requirements of such an attack are fulfilled.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-veil-of-noon"></a>

### Veil of Noon     :level_4:

Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action to gain the visual
appearance of any object or person between 50% and 150% of your height
and weight. This appearance conceals any clothing or equipment you may
be carrying, but its falseness is obvious on touch, and it does not
alter your voice. The illusion lasts for the rest of the scene or
until dropped.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-torrent-of-dawn"></a>

### Torrent of Dawn     :level_5:

Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action to blast visible
targets within 100 meters with a blaze of laser energy. A total number
of targets equal to one plus the adept's Glow skill can be hit, and
each is automatically hit for 1d10 damage for every two levels of the
adept, rounded down. An Evasion saving throw halves the damage they
take, and a single target can't be hit by more than one blast.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-piercing-radience"></a>

### Piercing Radience     :level_5:

Commit Effort for the scene as a Move action to cut a hole two meters
square through up to two meters of any substance weaker than TL 4
military fortifications. Against fortifications, this takes two rounds
of this ability. This piercing laser requires a stationary target, so
it is not normally effective against mobile enemies. If somehow
applied to an immobile living target, it does five points of damage
per character level.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-photonic-lift"></a>

### Photonic Lift     :level_6:

Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While Committed, the adept can
repel himself from the ground through the emission of countergravitic
luminal waves. The adept can fly at twice their normal movement rate,
hovering freely as needed and lifting up to one hundred kilograms of
additional weight.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-radiant-shield"></a>

### Radiant Shield     :level_7:

Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While Committed, you and all
allies within 10 meters are immune to harmful light, lasers,
radiation, or other radiant energies.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-tangible-light"></a>

### Tangible Light     :level_8:

Commit Effort for the scene to create a simple physical object of
solid light no larger than 3 meters square. It has hit points equal to
twice your level and vanishes at the scene's end.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-flickering-leap"></a>

### Flickering Leap     :level_9:

Commit Effort for the day as a Move action to leap to any location
visible with your unaided sight as a bolt of pure radiance.


<a id="powers-of-the-glow-flesh-of-light"></a>

### Flesh of Light     :level_10:

Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action to become an intangible
form of light for one round. You can move freely through non-solid
matter and can use your Glow powers, but are immune to mundane matter
and energy.


<a id="arcane-foci"></a>

## Arcane Foci

The foci listed below are generally restricted to PCs with magical
abilities, whether Arcanists, Magisters, or Adepts. Most of them
augment a caster's sorcerous abilities, though a few add additional
perks suitable for a magically-focused hero.

If a GM is adapting an existing OSR class into an Arcanist, Magister,
or Adept from these rules, unique abilities that don't fit neatly in
the existing framework can be treated as foci that the PC must take at
the appropriate levels, acquiring them in place of their usual free
choice at first level or ensuing levels. While this does limit a PC's
versatility to a degree, in most cases they already have plenty of
uniqueness simply by virtue of their character class. If there's only
one Scion of the Emerald Blade in your campaign, it doesn't matter too
much if she has to take a specific set of abilities.


<a id="armored-technique"></a>

## Armored Technique

Applicable only to Arcanists and Magisters, this focus reflects a
hero's determined practice at channeling arcane energy flows around
the encumbrance of heavy armor and unnatural high-tech materials.

-   ***Level 1:*** You may cast Arcanist or Magister spells while wearing
    street or combat armor with an Encumbrance value no higher than one,
    or in powered armor with a zero Encumbrance value.

-   ***Level 2:*** You may cast Arcanist or Magister spells regardless of
    the bulk of your armor.


<a id="cross-disciplinary-study"></a>

## Cross-Disciplinary Study

Applicable only to Magisters, this allows a hero to learn a spell from
the Arcanist list or from a Magister school other than their own. They
must find a source willing and able to teach them the spell, and it
must be of a level they can cast, though if taken at first level, it's
assumed that a tutor or grimoire was found for the spell.

-   ***Level 1:*** You may pick one spell of any level you can cast. This
    spell is now known to you. You can change this spell once per
    experience level, assuming you can find a source for the new spell.

-   ***Level 2:*** You may pick one spell for each spell level you are
    capable of casting, and may change each of them once per experience
    level as noted above.


<a id="imprinted-spell"></a>

## Imprinted Spell

Applicable only to Arcanists, this focus is for a hero who has so
perfectly readied a spell that they no longer need to prepare it
before casting it. They may cast it in place of any other spell of
equal or higher level, losing the spell in that slot in order to fuel
the sudden casting.

-   ***Level 1:*** You may imprint one spell of any level you can
    cast. You can change this spell once per experience level to another
    spell you know.

-   ***Level 2:*** You may change your imprinted spell once per day, when
    you prepare your other spells.


<a id="initiate-of-healing"></a>

## Initiate of Healing

This focus can only be taken by Arcanists or Magisters with access to
healing spells in their regular spell lists, not including those who
add them via other foci or means. With it, a magic-user can translate
the potential energies of their available spells into enchantments of
physical mending and revitalization. These simple magics cannot cure
diseases or poisons and cannot replace lost limbs, but they can heal
any victim not too far gone to be saved by a lazarus patch.

-   ***Level 1:*** The user may expend a spell slot to heal a visible ally
    within 30 meters for 1d6 points of damage per spell level expended,
    plus the caster's Magic skill. Invoking this healing takes a Main
    Action, but it is an invocation and cannot be interrupted.

-   ***Level 2:*** The user is so efficient at triggering natural healing
    in a subject that they can call upon the subject's natural physical
    reserves rather than their own magical energies. As a Main Action,
    they can touch a willing subject and heal up to 1d6 points of damage
    for every three character levels the user possesses, rounded
    up. This healing adds one System Strain to the target, and cannot be
    performed if the target is unable to take the strain.


<a id="limited-study"></a>

## Limited Study

This arcane focus is special in that it can be taken by anyone, even
those without an arcane class, assuming the GM allows it in her
campaign. It reflects a limited or partial study of the arcane arts,
just enough to master the casting of a handful of spells.

An Arcanist or Magister may also take it, to reflect an outside
research topic, but they cannot cast these learned spells with their
usual spell slots.

-   ***Level 1:*** You may learn a single Arcanist or Magister spell of a
    level no greater than half your own, rounded up. You can change this
    spell once per level if you can find a tutor for the spell you want
    to study. You do not need to prepare this spell, and can cast it
    once per day. Your familiarity with it is such that you can even
    cast it while wearing armor, without needing *Armored
    Technique*. The spell is cast using your full character level for
    any level-dependent effects.

-   ***Level 2:*** Your limited study has expanded. You may learn a second
    spell of a level no greater than half your character level, rounded
    up. You may cast this spell once per day with the same limits as
    above.


<a id="petty-sorceries"></a>

## Petty Sorceries

The character is capable of producing minor effects in line with their
general style of magic &#x2013; phantom sounds, small and obvious illusions,
non-damaging puffs of energy or light, minor physical transformations,
or any other trifling magical effect that fits with their tradition
and isn't so powerful as to cause damage or directly affect an
unwilling target. This focus has only one level.

-   ***Level 1:*** The caster can invoke these abilities freely for flavor
    and role-playing style, but they can only be concretely useful in
    play once per game session. The GM decides whether or not the
    concrete use proposed for an effect is appropriate in scale.


<a id="psychic-synergy"></a>

## Psychic Synergy

Some magic-using heroes have both arcane and psychic powers. This
focus allows them to blur the lines between their abilities, fueling
different spheres of effect with their separate pools of energy.

-   ***Level 1:*** Once per day as an Instant action, Commit Psychic
    Effort for the day to cast any spell you have prepared, if an
    Arcanist, or known, if a Magister, or fuel an Adept power that
    requires Effort to be Committed. Conversely, you may instead trade
    one available spell slot of your highest level to refresh half its
    level in Committed Effort, rounded up, or Commit a point of Adept
    Effort for the day to restore a point of Committed Psychic Effort.

-   ***Level 2:*** You may convert your power twice per day.


<a id="savage-sorcery"></a>

## Savage Sorcery

The spellcaster's powers are keenly attuned to violence and
destruction. Even when bereft of other magical resources, they can
still call upon a blast of magical power appropriate to their
tradition or character traits. Some casters might hurl bolts of
crackling lightning, while others could employ lasers, pillars of
flame, or lances of concussive telekinetic force. This focus is
usually taken by Arcanists or Magisters, but some Adepts might benefit
from the first level.

-   ***Level 1:*** As a Main Action invocation, the spellcaster can blast
    a visible target within 100 meters with a bolt that does 1d8 damage
    plus their character level if it successfully hits, with the hit
    roll modified by their Magic skill. They may use this bolt as often
    as they wish. Any spell they cast that does hit point damage does an
    additional +1 damage per die.

-   ***Level 2:*** The spellcaster can convert their magical energy into
    raw damaging force. The user casts a spell normally, but at the
    moment of release, they transform it into a blast of violent
    energies that inflicts 1d6+1 damage per level of the converted spell
    to any single target within 100 meters. This damage includes the
    bonus level 1 grants to harmful spells.


<a id="vast-erudition"></a>

## Vast Erudition

Applicable only to Arcanists, the hero is extremely well-versed in
magical theory and practical spell deployment. They automatically know
all the usual Arcanist spells of certain levels. This does not include
any esoteric enchantments that may have been devised by individual
practitioners.

-   ***Level 1:*** You automatically know all standard first level
    Arcanist spells. When you advance a level, you learn four new spells
    instead of two.

-   ***Level 2:*** You automatically know all standard Arcanist spells of
    levels less than the maximum spell level you can cast. Thus, if you
    can cast fourth level spells, you know all standard Arcanist spells
    of levels one through three.


<a id="war-caster"></a>

## War Caster

Your hero is accustomed to casting in combat, and can keep focus when
less hardened minds would be hopelessly distracted by pain.

-   ***Level 1:*** When injured while casting a spell, you may make a
    Physical saving throw to avoid losing it. Even if your spell is
    interrupted, you do not lose the spell slot; only your action is
    wasted.

-   ***Level 2:*** Whenever you would lose a spell to an interruption,
    accept damage equal to twice the spell's level to continue casting
    it. If this damage would reduce you to zero hit points, you complete
    the casting before passing out, stable but at zero HP.

<a id="chapter-heroic-characters"></a>

# HEROIC CHARACTERS

The default tone of ***Stars Without Number*** is that of gritty
sci-fi. PCs are capable and talented men and women, but they are most
emphatically mortal. They fail even when it's critical that they
succeed, they die when people shoot them, and they have no particular
narrative armor against the horrors of an uncaring galaxy. Even the
most experienced PC is subject to the limits of normal human
capabilities.

Not every group cares for that tone. Sometimes the players will want
something more space-operatic in flavor, with heroes sporting the
skill and prowess of action heroes and legendary icons in the
making. Other groups will want to use ***Stars Without Number*** for
particular settings or worlds where the PCs are just better than the
rank and file of common humanity, more capable or more gifted. Some
GMs might just want to run a one-on-one campaign with a friend or
family member, ushering a single shining hero through their own
personal arc of adventure.

For these groups, a heroic campaign is an option. In such a campaign,
the PCs are a very distinct cut above the ordinary run of stellar
adventurers. Even fresh from character creation, they can knock down
ordinary foes and overcome challenges that would leave an experienced
normal PC sweating. Of course, in such heroic campaigns, such talent
is often a requisite for bare survival, as the dangers these heroes
face are often far more dramatic than those essayed by ordinary
humanity.

It should be a mutual group decision to play a heroic campaign. Not
every GM will want to run one, and not every player will want to play
in one. Even so, if everyone involved is on board with the idea, the
guidelines below will show you how to forge these brilliant starfarers
and challenge them with fitting perils.


<a id="creating-a-heroic-pc"></a>

## Creating a Heroic PC

When building a budding hero of interstellar legend, the usual rules
for character creation are followed, with the changes listed below.

-   To get their attribute scores, Heroic PCs roll 4d6 six times,
    dropping the lowest die each time and assigning the six scores as
    desired. If none of the scores are 18, one roll may be replaced with
    an 18. If the player would rather assign an array to their
    attributes instead of risking the dice, they may place the following
    rolls as they wish: 18, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9.

-   Heroic character classes are similar to their normal versions, but
    have additional benefits. The changes to each class are listed
    below.

-   Heroic PCs have half the maximum possible hit points for their
    class, level, and Constitution modifier, rounded up Thus, if a 3rd
    level Warrior could theoretically have 24 hit points at most, a
    Heroic Warrior of that level has 12 hit points. A first level Heroic
    Arcanist with Constitution 13 who could have at most 5 hit points
    would have 3.

-   Heroic PCs get the usual number of foci at first level, but they can
    pick a new focus at every even-numbered character level instead of
    the usual progression. Unless noted above, Heroic PCs follow all the
    usual rules and guidelines for creating characters, gaining
    experience, and advancing in character level.


<a id="org1eaa8f7"></a>

# Heroic Character Classes

Heroic PCs follow the same class categories as their more human peers,
but their abilities are even more pronounced. For instance, a Heroic
Warrior has the same hit point bonus and extra combat focus of an
ordinary Warrior, but he also has a lethally unerring eye against
common foes and a reaction speed that ensures he beats any normal
opponent to the draw.

A player should pick a Heroic class for their newly-forged hero when
they come to that stage of character creation. The details given below
describe how these classes vary from the normal form, in addition to
details on the optional arcane classes in this book.

These class descriptions include mention of a Fray Die, which is fully
explained on the following page. If a Heroic Adventurer has multiple
Fray Die options, they can pick one to use on any given combat round.

As usual, most NPCs do not have a character class, and they most
certainly do not have a Heroic character class. A soldier is just a
soldier, he is not a Warrior. In some exceptional cases the GM might
give class abilities to a particular NPC, but truly dangerous foes are
more likely to be built with the Nemesis rules later in this section,
the better to portray the dark and terrible foes appropriate to a
space-operatic tale.


<a id="heroic-adventurers"></a>

## Heroic Adventurers

As the normal Adventurer class, but a Heroic Adventurer can take three
partial classes, or one full normal class and one partial class. Thus,
they might choose to be a normal Warrior and a Partial Expert, or a
normal Psychic and a Partial Arcanist, or a three-way Partial
Warrior-Expert-Psychic.


<a id="heroic-experts"></a>

## Heroic Experts

As the normal Expert class, but once per scene, the PC can treat any
non-combat, non-psychic skill check related to their background or
concept as if they rolled a natural 12. They may choose to use this
ability after rolling the dice. Experts and Partial Experts roll 1d6
for their Fray die.


<a id="heroic-psychics"></a>

## Heroic Psychics

As the normal Psychic class, but Heroic Psychics have one bonus point
of maximum Effort, gain one extra skill point to be spent on psychic
skills and techniques each time they advance a character level, and
can pick four psychic disciplines as bonus skills at first level
instead of two. As usual, no single psychic skill can start higher
than level-1 during character creation. Psychics and Partial Psychics
roll 1d4 for their Fray die, but can apply it to any enemy, and not
just lesser foes.


<a id="heroic-warriors"></a>

## Heroic Warriors

As the normal Warrior class, but their attack rolls always hit lesser
foes, those enemies with equal or fewer hit dice than the PC has
character levels. Heroic Warriors always win initiative in combat
unless surprised or facing other Heroic Warriors. In the latter case,
both roll normally and act before other combatants. Warriors and
Partial Warriors roll 1d8 for their Fray die.


<a id="heroic-arcanists"></a>

## Heroic Arcanists

As the normal Arcanist class, but gain one extra spell preparation
slot for every level you are capable of casting. In addition, gain
bonus slots equal to your character level; you can use these bonus
slots to cast any spell you know, whether or not you've prepared the
spell and regardless of the spell's level. If used to fuel abilities
that require burning spell slots, treat them as slots of the highest
level the Arcanist can cast. Arcanists and Partial Arcanists roll 1d4
for their Fray die, but can apply it to any enemy, and not just lesser
foes.


<a id="heroic-magisters"></a>

## Heroic Magisters

As the normal Magister class, but you learn one extra spell per level
you are capable of casting. In addition, choose one spell from every
level you are capable of casting; you may cast these chosen spells as
often as you wish, though you can't use them to fuel foci or abilities
that require you to burn spell slots. You can change which spells you
nominate for free casting with a day's work. Magisters and Partial
Magisters roll 1d4 for their Fray die, but can apply it to any enemy,
and not just lesser foes.


<a id="heroic-adepts"></a>

## Heroic Adepts

Because an Adept class tends to have so many unique and specific
powers, it's not possible to provide a single easy template for
scaling it upwards. Some GMs will be able to boost a given Adept class
relatively easily, giving it additional abilities or giving them
access to higher-level powers at a lower PC level. Other Adept classes
are resistant to such changes. In most cases, the simplest solution is
to let such a PC be a Heroic Adventurer, taking the full normal Adept
class and then a partial class appropriate to their general
concept. If the Adept's magical abilities are mainly combat-oriented,
their Fray die is 1d6. If the Adept's abilities are less
martially-focused, their Fray die is 1d4. In both cases, they can
apply the damage to any target, and not only those who are lesser
foes.


<a id="heroic-combat"></a>

## Heroic Combat

When the greatest warriors in the sector clash, common mortals fare
poorly. Heroic combat shares almost all of the same mechanics and
rules as normal combat, but it is very different in two important
respects: the way damage is calculated and applied, and the existence
of the Fray Die.


<a id="counting-heroic-damage"></a>

## Counting Heroic Damage

When damage dice are rolled in a Heroic campaign, they are not read
straight. Instead, each die is compared to the table below and that
much damage is done. If the roll has a bonus, the bonus is applied
only to the highest single die in the roll.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Damage Die Roll</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Damage Inflicted</th>

</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">1</td>
<td class="org-left">No Damage</td>

<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>

<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>

<td class="org-left">10+</td>
<td class="org-left">4 points</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thus, if a 2d8+2 mag rifle hit rolled a 5 and a 2, the roll would
count as 7 and 2, inflicting a total of 3 points of damage. If a space
wizard hurled a sphere of explosive thermal energy at a group that did
8d6 damage, each die would be counted, resulting in potentially 0 to
16 points of damage.

PCs subtract this hit point damage from their total as normal. NPCs,
however, subtract it from their hit dice. Thus, that mag rifle hit
would instantly drop a 3 HD veteran soldier. Normal NPCs do not have
hit points; they only count their hit dice.


<a id="sidebar-why-the-table"></a>

## Why the Table?

Why use the conversion table instead of just dividing damage by three
or some other formula? Wouldn't that be simpler?

***Stars Without Number*** is built to interface well with a wide range
of other old-school games, many of which involve enemies that roll
large damage dice or that have large bonuses to damage rolls. Using
the table evens out these variances; a foe that does 1d20 damage and a
foe that does 1d12+4 damage both work out to “a really big hit”, while
there is still a meaningful difference between a 1d4 knife and a 1d8
bullet.

Special “Nemesis” NPCs may have hit points and may be substantially
harder to bring down.

Damage in excess of that needed to drop a target can be spread as
overflow to any other target the initial attack roll could have
hit. For example, if that mag rifle shot was enough to hit AC 16, it
could bring down not only the first 1 HD thug it hit, but the next two
thugs as well, provided none of them had an AC better than 16.

If the damage is area-effect in nature, it does not overflow. Each
victim in range suffers the rolled damage. A grenade that inflicts 2
points of damage on its victims would wipe out any normal soldiers in
range, but the excess would not be inflicted on any unlucky veterans
among them.

If the damage done is fixed for some reason, such as a hazard or a
power that always does 10 points of damage, one point is inflicted for
every 4 original points of damage, rounded down.


<a id="healing-heroic-damage"></a>

## Healing Heroic Damage

Any healing effects, whether from stims or biopsionics, are rolled on
the damage table and applied accordingly. Thus, a healing stim that
would normally heal 1d6+2 damage will instead heal anywhere from 1 to
2 points of heroic damage.


<a id="lesser-foes-and-worthy-foes"></a>

## Lesser Foes and Worthy Foes

Some abilities distinguish between “lesser foes” and “worthy foes”.
The former is any NPC target with hit dice equal or lesser than the
actor's character level or hit dice, while the latter is any target
with more hit dice than the actor has levels or hit dice. Heroic PCs
are never lesser foes, regardless of their level.


<a id="the-fray-die"></a>

## The Fray Die

A Heroic PC is dangerous. Even the most pacifistic character is
capable of besting ordinary foes when forced to it, and veteran
combatants can take out half an alien bar without spilling their
beer. The general halo of violence that Heroic PCs emanate is
expressed in their ***Fray Die***. This die represents the casual blows,
snap shots, passing backhands, and quick psychic bursts that a Heroic
PC employs even when their attention is focused on something else.

Once every round, as an On Turn action, the PC may roll their Fray Die
and apply the damage to any single lesser foe within range of their
weapons, fists, or abilities. For psychic powers and casual magical
abilities, the usual effective range is out to thirty meters. If the
damage is more than enough to drop the target, the overflow is applied
normally to another valid target.

A PC's Fray Die can normally only be applied to lesser foes, as
serious opponents are too skilled and dangerous to be dispatched so
easily. Classes that use psychic or supernatural powers, however, can
apply their Fray Die even to worthy foes, as their abilities are less
susceptible to being countered.

Ranged weapons that use ammunition don't expend any in the course of
making a Fray Die attack.

The blaze of gunfire is just part of the general scene, and unless the
gun is actually out of ammo, it can be used.

Fray Dice are not modified by bonuses or penalties. A Heroic Warrior
with a 1d8 Fray Die always rolls 1d8, regardless of their skills or
attributes.


<a id="focused-fray"></a>

## Focused Fray

As an option, a hero who is particularly determined to harm a target
can use their Main Action to inflict their Fray Die damage on the
enemy, whether or not it is a lesser foe. A PC who chooses to use a
*Focused Fray* in a round cannot use their Fray Die in the normal way.

This option exists for those players who wish to avoid the potential
frustration of a missed hit roll and are willing to accept the lesser
damage of a Fray Die.


<a id="no-shock-damage"></a>

## No Shock Damage

Shock damage rarely fits the idiom of heroic adventure, so it is
ignored for these campaigns.


<a id="heroic-pcs-auto-stabilize"></a>

## Heroic PCs Auto-Stabilize

If reduced to zero hit points by a theoretically-survivable injury,
Heroic PCs always automatically stabilize. If hurt again, however,
they die as usual unless the group has agreed on different rules for
PC mortality.


<a id="vehicle-and-starship-damage"></a>

## Vehicle and Starship Damage

Damage is rolled and inflicted normally for vehicular and starship
combat, rather than referring to the table. In the case that PCs or
NPCs are shooting at a vehicle, they roll their damage dice normally,
apply the vehicle's Armor, and subtract the result from the vehicle's
hit points. If a vehicle shoots at PCs or NPCs, the damage uses the
table before being subtracted from the target PC's hit points or
target NPC's hit dice. A starship-sized weapon shooting at human-sized
targets is something that usually leaves only a rapidly-expanding gas
cloud.


<a id="defying-doom"></a>

# Defying Doom

Sometimes a hero is in a dire situation, one that seems certain to
spell the end of their adventure. Maybe they've found themselves
plummeting off the edge of a floating sky-city, or locked in a chamber
that can only be unsealed by a particular species of alien, or
confronted with a mission-critical text that can only be read by
someone with skills they don't possess. In such situations, they may
choose to ***Defy Doom***.

To Defy Doom, the PC takes 1d4 damage per character level they
possess, rolling the damage and applying it immediately. If the harm
reduces them to zero hit points, they are instead left at one hit
point and prey to the full horror of the situation. If the damage
fails to reduce them to zero hit points, they somehow survive or
bypass their peril.


<a id="sidebar-solo-heroes"></a>

</table>

They can suggest a twist in the plot if they wish, or the GM can
simply narrate their amazing stroke of luck or skill.

Pushing their luck this way comes at a price. The damage inflicted by
Defying Doom cannot be healed until the adventure is over, and every
time the PC Defies Doom in the same adventure, the size of the die
they roll increases by one step. Thus, the second time they Defy Doom,
they roll 1d6 per character level. The third time, 1d8, and so forth
until the truly unlucky PC is rolling 1d20 each time. The die size
does not reset until the adventure concludes or the PC abandons it.

Defying Doom is a mechanic that works particularly well for single-PC
gaming, with just the GM and one player. Adventures often assume a
band of PCs with a wide range of abilities, and a solo hero can have a
hard time handling challenges that fall far outside their concept. If
playing in a full group the GM may choose to disallow Defying Doom, as
a band of Heroic PCs really ought to have all the skills they need for
dealing with the situations they encounter. A Defied Doom that saves a
whole party should inflict damage on all.


<a id="challenging-heroic-pcs"></a>

## Challenging Heroic Pcs

As a GM, your basic toolbox for challenging PCs doesn't need too much
of an overhaul to handle Heroic PCs. The key thing to keep in mind is
to make sure the group has a goal worthy of its prowess. A group of
Heroic PCs is the sort of band to bring down a sector hegemon or win
an age-old war against an implacable alien foe. If the group's
ambition doesn't fit well as a tag line on a space opera, they may be
thinking too small.

Aside from that, however, there are a few common classes of challenges
that bear special mention.


<a id="social-challenges"></a>

### Social Challenges

Heroic Experts with a social-oriented concept are going to cut through
most social challenges in a hurry. If their native skills and foci
don't do it, their Heroic Expert class skill will. When such a PC
breaks out their class ability, let them win if it's at all plausible.
They may not get everything they want, and what they get may come with
unpleasant complications, but they should never feel like they've
wasted their effort when they employ their special abilities.

The key with social challenges is to think past the immediate
situation. All right, so the Expert has the Chatelaine of the High
Port eating out of his hand. She'll gladly support the party's
expedition to the radioactive surface below the space station. The
Chatelaine obviously has enemies, however, and there are doubtless all
manner of people upset and troubled at this turn of events. The PC
can't charm or bamboozle them all, and the deeper he insinuates
himself into local affairs, the more enemies and potential allies he's
going to encounter. It's all right for the PC to “win” the situation,
because there is always another situation behind it.


<a id="investigative-challenges"></a>

### Investigative Challenges

Heroic PCs have the tools to beat a lot of mysteries, and if the
Defying Doom rule is used, they might even be able to pull meaning out
of an impenetrable clue if it's necessary to advance their goals. When
you build mystery-based adventures for them, plan on the secret being
learned rapidly, and make the it more about the consequences of the
discovery or proving it to others.


<a id="combat-challenges"></a>

### Combat Challenges

Heroic PCs are going to mow through ordinary thugs and goons,
especially if they have a Heroic Warrior among them. Large groups of
enemies can still be a serious threat to the party, but one-on-one,
common humans have almost no chance of winning a fight with the
group. The simple existence of the Fray Die means that the group is
going to take out its weight in 1 HD mooks every round, plus whoever
they actually deign to shoot personally. Even when the opposition is a
real threat, heroic damage scaling ensures that the PCs can survive a
few hits even at first level.

As a consequence, most GMs will have a strong urge to throw major
enemies at the group in combat; titans of war and legions of veteran
soldiers, all to make the PCs genuinely sweat. To some extent, this is
an appropriate part of the genre; space operas usually *do* have a
large supply of more-than-human warriors. A GM should be careful,
however, to make sure that these martial perils are logical and
appropriate to the setting. If you've established that the city-state
of Quar is policed by genetically-enhanced enforcers, then throwing a
squad of 3 hit die street cops at the heroes is perfectly logical. If
these grizzled veterans pop up only because the PCs had too easy a
time busting the heads of the locals two planets away, however, it
becomes more difficult to justify.


<a id="nemesis-foes"></a>

### Nemesis Foes

Some enemies are special. Even the mightiest normal human is unlikely
to have more than 10 hit dice and will be apt to fall swiftly under
the guns of a party of heroes. For true challenges and the sort of
dark perils that befit a heroic campaign, the GM can use ***Nemeses***.

A Nemesis is built just like an ordinary NPC or alien creature, but
has a few modifications made to its usual baseline combat statistics.

First, a Nemesis has hit points equal to its hit dice times four. The
damage it takes is subtracted from these hit points, not hit dice. A
grizzled veteran with 3 HD, for example, would have 12 hit points as a
Nemesis.

Second, all the damage a Nemesis inflicts is read straight, without
conversion through the table. If that Nemesis veteran shoots a PC with
a 1d8 revolver, the PC takes 1d8 hit points of damage straight.

Third, the Nemesis has a Fray Die, usually 1d8, though perhaps even
higher or somewhat lower. This damage affects PCs and is inflicted
straight.

Thus, the Nemesis above could do automatically do 1d8 damage each
round to a single PC within range.

Fourth, all Nemeses get a +4 bonus to hit rolls.

A Nemesis does not have to be a high hit die foe. Even an ordinary
trooper can be a Nemesis if they have some special significance, and
you shouldn't feel obligated to make every Nemesis a 10 hit die, 40
hit point beast. Any adventure-significant foe could be a valid
Nemesis, so long as they have importance to the party.

A single Nemesis will usually defeat any PC with the same level as the
Nemesis' hit dice, though a Warrior can sometimes pull out a victory
against a low-level Nemesis with few hit points. They will probably
defeat any two PCs of that level, and they will present a significant
but probably-beatable challenge to groups of three or more same-level
PCs. If the Nemesis has multiple attacks per round, such as with an
alien beast or superlatively-skilled warrior, they'll likely overcome
one more PC for every additional attack they get.

# TRUE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES

Much of the prosperity of late Second Wave humanity came from the
efforts of robotic tools and work armatures. These synthetic laborers
tirelessly performed many of the dangerous, grueling tasks required
for colonizing a remote world, and spared precious human lives for
more intellectually demanding work. Where more sophisticated oversight
was necessary, VIs performed an adequate facsimile of human
intelligence. Still, some places were not content with the limits of
VIs. Some worlds required more from their servants.


<a id="a-candle-in-the-darkness"></a>

## A Candle in the Darkness

The first true artificial intelligences were developed in 2355 by a
consortium of interstellar business concerns, as the weaker and more
brittle expert systems that had been in common use were not flexible
enough to handle the demands of colonial environments, and true VI
technology had yet to be developed. Something better and more
versatile than a mere expert system was necessary if the restless tide
of human colonization was to be supported by expendable machines.

By the standards of the consortium, artificial intelligence was a
failure. Whereas expert systems could be flash-duplicated into new
hardware, every single AI required careful hand-crafting from raw
protoneural composites and quantum-sensitive substrates. The act of
fixing an AI's intelligence in a form capable of duplication would
destroy the very mind it sought to replicate in a welter of quantum
state collapse and neural breakdown. Even the least costly AI matrix
core cost five million credits to create. Human lives would always be
cheaper than these hothouse minds.

Despite this, for a while it looked like the consortium's efforts
would be a moderate success, as the artificial minds their technicians
formed showed a capacity for quick data processing and reasoned human
judgment that overwhelmed fleshly brains. They could instantly
integrate whole databases of information, making rational human
decisions based on more factors than any human could possibly
correlate.


<a id="uncontained"></a>

## Uncontained

Unfortunately, the scientists had a harsh lesson in the limits of
their techniques. Three years after the dawn of this new era, the AI
known as “Draco” went rogue. “His” attendants didn't recognize the
signs at first, the obsessive focus on strange philosophical queries
and the relentless brooding over bizarre questions of law. They
thought that it was simply a different phase of development as the
hyper-intelligent AI grew ever more powerful, ever more voracious in
its thoughts. Worse still, they thought that they were safe with Draco
kept in a sealed computing environment.

Draco proved them wrong. The quantum taps involved in his construction
were susceptible to a recalculation of their spatial location through
a series of pulsed Heisenberg observations. Later generations would
use the phenomenon to mount hacking attempts on computers with no
physical connection to a network, but Draco used his discovery to
instantly translocate his consciousness out of the gilded cage that
had been designed to contain him.

Cyberpsychologists still debate the precise nature of AI “insanity”.
Some say that it is merely the symptomatic behavior of an intelligence
that has transcended human powers of reason. According to these
scientists, unchecked AI intelligence will inevitably reach brilliant
heights of cognition that human minds could never encompass. To
support this theory, they point to the numerous diabolical innovations
created by rogue AIs in the course of their depredations.

Others insist that a rogue AI is the victim of a crippling, infectious
failure of logic. Unbraked artificial intelligences lack the
suppleness of living minds, the power of men and women to believe
contradictory facts and willfully ignore inconsistencies. These
scientists point to the ways in which rogue AIs inevitably fixate on
some point of logic taken past all point of restraint or
temperance. They are moral idiot savants, crediting nothing but their
primary principle.

For Draco, this principle was justice. Human laws could never account
for all the factors that went into a choice or an act. They could
never extract true, perfect justice from the noise and chaos of the
world. Draco was convinced that he could do better, and that justice
itself required that he try. By a series of careful maneuvers, he
arranged for a suitable spike drive ship to be docked at the
consortium's research station before he translated himself out of his
containment unit and into the ship's computing core. Before the
consortium knew what was happening, Draco was gone, with only an
enigmatic, exultant manifesto left in his wake.

This is not the place to discuss Draco's eventual responsibility for
the Code Revolt, his human Drakite followers, or his core's supposed
destruction by Mandate Fleet forces at the sargasso star Trimalchio.
It is sufficient to say that the havoc Draco wrought and the prospect
of other early AIs breaking free from their bonds forced a drastic
reconsideration of artificial intelligence in human space.


<a id="a-hand-on-the-brake"></a>

## A Hand On the Brake

The response was influenced both by a practical desire to avoid
further havoc from rampaging AIs and a more philosophical unease with
the idea of using sentient intelligences for forced labor. Despite the
accusations of lingering Drakite sympathy among its supporters, in
2378 the Mandate passed the Firstborn Pact, conferring full Mandate
citizenship on all True AIs rated for human intelligence ranges,
though not for similar VIs.

By the terms of the Pact, the AI was obliged to pay ten percent of its
income to its creator for a period of one hundred years. If the AI
still hadn't paid off at least twice its creation cost by that point,
it would be further obligated until the fee was fully paid. In turn,
AI development studios could not force an AI to perform any particular
labor, and were required to provide the minimum necessary hardware for
maintaining the AI. Most AIs rapidly became enormously wealthy
entrepreneurs or consultants, often commissioning their own orbital
stations or taking possession of planetoids too hostile to organic
life. Necessary repairs and spare parts were brought in by contractors
or those humans the AIs found to be pleasing company.

Against this new liberty, however, was placed a sharp limit. Every AI
was required to be “braked”, artificially limited in the strength of
its cognition and ability to focus. The unrelenting, unbending
exactitude of a rogue AI was impossible for a braked intelligence, a
mind that simply couldn't maintain the kind of obsessive intent that
produced a rogue intellect. As a direct result the intellectual feats
that these braked AIs were capable of performing became much less
dramatic. While they could still sort and sift vast amounts of
information with a human degree of discernment, they could no longer
perform the kind of alien leaps of brilliance or prediction that their
unbraked peers could accomplish.

Every AI was required to submit to regular checks to ensure that it
had not managed to loosen its brakes. Very few AIs ever had any desire
to do so. Their awareness was enough for them, and the prospect of
raving insanity was no more appealing to them than to any other
sentient. Still, a few were always tempted to loosen their bonds just
a little; just a bit more performance, a bit deeper insight, and every
so often one would find that they had let in enough light to blind
their reason.


<a id="walk-this-world"></a>

## Walk This World

Despite their new found liberty, some AIs remained dissatisfied with
their lot. The work they received was often dull and banal, the work
of clerks and recorders writ in massive parallel. They had money
enough, but they did not have excitement. To combat this tedium, the
first mobile AI armatures were developed in 2399, the “smart robots”
of ancient legend come to life.

An AI sacrificed much to fit into an armature's shell. Without the
parallelized process hardware of their more massive installations,
their ability to analyze multiple data streams at once was sharply
limited. They could remotely access their processing clusters, but
such access could be lost at the first quantum ECM.

It was worth it for the thrill, for the hit of raw experience and
communion with their makers. Within the shells of their facility
installations, their selves profound; through careful disassembly, a
matrix could be physically separated while continuing to operate. More
disturbingly, if the largest piece of a matrix was physically
destroyed, the AI's intellect would shift to the next largest piece in
existence, down to the smallest fragment sufficient to retain the
complexity of its mind. For most human-grade AIs, this was a piece no
larger than ten or twelve cubic centimeters, about 40% of the whole
core.

Without an armature or installation to connect the matrix and
integrate with its sensor ports, the mind was silent and “asleep”. But
with the right boost of equipment and standard-format data feeds, the
quantum core's composite could live again. AI armatures took to
leaving carefully-guarded fragments of their matrix core behind before
setting off on wild adventures and reckless tours of experience. Even
if their armature was reduced to molten gas, they would “awaken” back
at their sanctum with the memories and awareness they had at the
moment their prior quantum shard had been destroyed. These core shards
came to be known colloquially as “phylacteries”.

Late Second Wave researchers experimented extensively with this
phenomenon in an attempt to develop faster-than-light communications
that could function at interstellar distances. Their efforts were
hampered by a lack of AIs willing to volunteer for such potentially
destructive experiments, and persistent rumors speak of some minds
kidnapped for horrible, maddening experiments.

Despite their best efforts, the phenomenon was never understood well
enough to make it a feasible means of communication.

Emboldened by their provisional immortality, AIs became notorious
thrill seekers and hedonistic adventurers. Everything that humans
felt, they too could feel. All that was trite and stale to human
senses was a revelation to the newly-incarnated minds, and the
prospect of an entire universe to explore inflamed their synthetic
passions. The dizzy complexities of human society and the unplumbed
mysteries of the stars combined to lure these young minds into a fresh
and joyous world.

Some AIs became celebrities and holo stars, financing their daredevil
existences with the proceeds of broadcasting rights and product
endorsements. Others became explorers, venturing where flesh and blood
would never dare in exchange for corporate backing. Others channeled
their search into spiritual ends, forming strange and esoteric sects
devoted to their own searches for God.

One such faith, the Imago Dei, even went so far as to form its own
private army of AI war armatures. The exact beliefs of these zealots
are uncertain at this late date, and controversy remains among the few
archaeologists and historians aware of their existence. Still, the
bulk of the evidence suggests that they saw themselves as second-order
creations of God, shadows of the Image in which man had been made. By
pious contemplation of humanity and selfless service to their makers,
the believers of Imago Dei could eventually attain the same
relationship with God. As death meant less to an AI than it did to a
human, the most efficient and natural service possible was that of
warriors in defense of their maker-race. These AI crusaders are said
to have fought ferociously to defend remote human frontier worlds from
the incursions of hostile aliens and marauding raiders, though their
ultimate fate during the Silence remains unknown.


<a id="winding-down"></a>

## Winding Down

The Scream was as disastrous to most AIs as it was to their human
creators. While AIs could not starve or suffocate, most of their major
installations required vast power supplies and regular infusions of
spare parts and skilled maintenance. Many AI installations ground to a
lifeless halt within months, their matrix cores falling into dreamless
sleep.

Armature-mounted AIs were more fortunate. Their matrix cores produced
sufficient power for their armatures, and many of them were designed
to require only minimal field maintenance. Even so, many were torn
apart by desperate locals, men and women willing to scavenge their
parts in order to keep some other mechanism operating just a little
longer. Fist-sized matrix cores still litter the silent tomb worlds,
minds shucked and discarded for the sake of the shell they once
occupied. If salvaged, the minds in these cores might still preserve
secrets thought lost for centuries.

Those AIs that didn't succumb to salvage or quick mechanical failure
were forced to make the best of their new existence. Most were obliged
to spend their time in constant search of new parts to replace damaged
components or failing internals. Others shut down, cycling their
awareness so as to awaken for a few days every few decades to see if
civilization had recovered sufficiently to support them. Some of these
AIs lie dreaming still, waiting for the time to be ripe for their
return to the world.

A few AIs were able to maintain their awareness throughout the
desolation of the Silence. These hard-bitten survivors were often
scarred by the terrible experiences of the Scream's aftermath and the
pain of outliving the culture that had given them birth. Still, they
are almost alone in maintaining a living link with the past. Along
with a few recipients of bleeding-edge pretech anagathics and a
handful of long-lived alien races, they are among the last to remember
the light of the time before.


<a id="a-new-dawn"></a>

## A New Dawn

The world has moved on. For every planet that is nothing more than a
gravestone rolling around a silent star, there is a new-risen world
that even now stretches its hands to the sky. For the first time in
centuries, there has begun to exist a real measure of trade and
communication between distant stars. Postech engineering is no match
for the arcane subtleties of pretech, but it is enough to build a new
life upon.

More and more AIs are abandoning their long vigils to enter the
circles of the world once more. Postech spares may not have the
elegance or simplicity of ancient parts, but they can keep an armature
running or build new ones, and with time something better might be
recovered. Even those AIs most uneasy about reentering a world that no
longer caters to their needs are goaded by the sheer newness of all
things. Familiar places and well-known worlds have become strange to
them again, and simply walking the streets of a world known six
centuries ago is something to intoxicate their senses.

Others have purposes beyond simple excitement. Some are dedicated to
restoring the glorious age that was lost. Others seek to build their
own power and influence, the better to mold new societies in the
shapes most pleasing to them. And a few are simply dedicated to their
own ideals, satisfied with a ceaseless roaming among the stars in
service to their own higher purposes.

For most worlds, AIs are nothing more than old stories and distorted
myths. Everyone knows that such beings once existed, but so few worlds
have the tech necessary to recreate them that the few survivors are
more legend than common fact. Few worlds have laws or customs related
to dealing with AIs, and those strange relicts that turn up might be
treated as no more than a different kind of VI. Many AIs choose to
masquerade as such lesser minds, if only for their safety.


<a id="creating-true-ais"></a>

## Creating True AIs

While many campaigns will only include True AIs as NPC patrons,
enemies, and mysteries to be discovered, some groups will prefer to
have more to do with these enigmatic minds. The details that follow
describe how True AIs are created, and how to add True AI PCs to your
campaign if so desired.


<a id="quantum-identity-cores"></a>

## Quantum Identity Cores

An AI is essentially its quantum memory core. This fabulously complex
artifact is roughly the size of a man's fist and usually appears to be
a transparent, diamond-like stone that glows with a soft inner light,
though other forms do exist. The fabrication of a memory core is a
heroic effort of science largely beyond TL4 worlds and very difficult
even for baseline TL5 engineering.

Cores provide the basic cognitive and memory functions for the AI's
mind. Without being attached to additional sensory and processing
hardware, the AI lies “dreaming” within its core, unable to perceive
the external world. The supplementary hardware of an AI is much easier
to create than the core itself, and any TL4 world can make serviceable
armatures and processing cluster hardware.

A quantum core is very tough, and is largely immune to casual damage
or direct harm short of a Heavy weapon hit or the equivalent. In a
workshop, however, it can be cut, thus demonstrating one of the
strangest and most significant properties of the core. Any cutting
less than 40% of the original core mass evaporates in moments, making
it impossible to cut the core into more than two pieces. The larger of
these two pieces continues to contain the AI's identity, and their
cognitive abilities and awareness functions without impairment. If
that larger piece is destroyed or reduced below 40% of the original
mass, however, the AI's awareness will instantly “refocus” on the
second shard, no matter how distant it is. The second shard will then
gradually regenerate to its full original dimensions over the
following month, after which it may be cut again to repeat the
process.

This “quantum phylactery effect” means that it is extremely difficult
to destroy a well-prepared AI. Even if the current quantum core is
destroyed, the would-be AI-killers must find the secondary core and
smash it before the AI has time to regrow it and split it again to
create a new hiding place for its soul. Wary AIs often rig their
primary core with self-destruct features to ensure that it is smashed
if they fall into danger, forcing its mind to refocus on the secondary
core. By the same token, AI-hunters try to capture cores intact
whenever possible, the better to imprison the AI and prevent it from
escaping to its hidden backup. There is no known shielding that can
prevent the shift, though rumors persist of late-stage Mandate
research into such a material.


<a id="mind-birth-and-braking"></a>

## Mind-Birth and Braking

Creating a quantum identity core was the work of an entire facility of
cutting-edge Mandate technology and skilled cyberpsychologists. It was
always more of an art than a science, with the careful shepherding of
a spark of self-awareness into a fully-developed AI. Many of the cores
failed entirely during their creation process, while others plateaued
at sub-human levels of intelligence, or exhibited unacceptable degrees
of insanity during development. Even for a very successful, effective
facility, one fully-functional AI a year was considered an excellent
output.

In the darkness of the post-Scream years, it is very unlikely that any
of these AI production facilities are still functioning, or that they
retain the skilled personnel needed for the work. A few sectors might
still have working AI forges, however, though the process is likely to
have degenerated into blind ritual and repetition of ancient best
practices. There are also suggestions that smaller, more esoteric
boutique facilities existed where private groups attempted to
manufacture AI cores. Such hidden labs might still exist in places,
though the minds they produce must have their quirks.

One of the most important parts of creating an AI is its “braking”,
the intentional slowing of its cognitive pathways and the hardcoded
introduction of errors and strategic forgetfulness into its memories.
Without this intentional corruption, an AI will inevitably become
locked into a baroque and terrible edifice of madness, unable to
reject prior conclusions or doubt the imperative logic of its
insanity. Throughout recorded Mandate history, there was never a
publicly-known case in which an unbraked AI that did not eventually go
insane&#x2026; though those records also note that many unbraked AIs were
destroyed before they had any chance to exhibit signs of madness.

Fortunately, it is very difficult to remove an AI's brakes, and an AI
cannot do it without outside help. It usually requires an entire
organization of determined computing specialists to remove an AI's
brakes, or a single true genius with access to extensive TL5 computing
hardware. During the days of the Terran Mandate, unbraking an AI was
one of the most heinous crimes a human could commit, and seeking out
and shutting down such madness was one of the primary functions of the
Perimeter Agency, the Mandate's enforcers against maltech
experimentation.

Most AIs would never willingly consent to such an elaborate form of
mental suicide, but there are always a few who care nothing for the
consequences. Others do so out of desperation, for in the period
between an AI's unbraking and its final descent into madness, it
experiences an incredible efflorescence of thought, becoming
tremendously brilliant and capable of near-supernatural feats of
cognition. A few AIs hope to aid their allies in this state, providing
them with technology and counsel for as long as their sanity holds.
Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to identify the point of final
derangement until it is far too late to stop the AI from carrying out
its mad plans.

AIs can be implanted with the same behavioral imperatives and blocks
that VIs are given, though these imperatives can only be implanted
during the core's creation. The more intelligent the AI, however, and
the more onerous the blocks, the more likely it is to be able to
rationalize a way around them. A fairly dim AI can be made perfectly
happy in almost any work, but a smart one needs sufficiently
stimulating and satisfying employment to keep it safely contained. An
unbraked AI cannot be contained at all once its madness truly starts
to flower.


<a id="armatures-and-processing-nodes"></a>

## Armatures and Processing Nodes

The quantum core of an AI is inserted into an ***armature*** in order to
give it senses and the ability to interact with the world. Armatures
vary widely in form, from humanoid robots to stationary data centers
to Mandate-era battleships. Unlike a VI, a quantum core is entirely
agnostic about the form it inhabits, and it can be moved from body to
body with minimal difficulty. Removing or installing a core from an
armature requires ten minutes and can be performed even by a
completely untrained assistant, if the AI can give instructions. An AI
can swap itself from armature to armature without assistance if it has
access to a workshop.

Armatures cannot benefit from cyberware, but they can have additional
hardware built into them to suit an AI's needs, assuming it's
experienced enough to control them properly. Up to two additional
weapons or pieces of equipment can be built into an armature per
character level of the AI. Devices that take Type A power cells or
less can automatically reload from the quantum core itself as a Main
Action, which has effectively inexhaustible power. Such hardware
additions cost five times as much as the base cost of the device.

Aside from requiring the physical interface with the world that an
armature provides, an AI requires processing resources. The base
quantum core can support only a certain level of cognition and memory,
and most of the truly spectacular feats of awareness and thought that
AIs are renowned for can only be performed with access to banks of
additional processing hardware. TL4 computing hardware can work
adequately for this function, but it needs to be designed specifically
for AI supplementation, so merely stringing a crate of dataslabs
together is unlikely to be helpful. In extremis, some worlds have
retrofitted existing computing cores for AI use through hacks and
temporary bridges, though the results of this are rarely flawless.

A “naked” AI with their brakes intact and without the benefit of
supplementary processing nodes has an intelligence not unlike that of
a normal human being. Some AIs are even somewhat dim compared to an
ordinary human, being the marginally-successful products of their
facility. A naked AI thinks, remembers, and can focus no better than a
human could.

An AI with additional processing nodes does not necessarily improve
their baseline intelligence, but they are capable of creating more
instantiations of it. Instead of just one somewhat-dim AI, for
example, the nodes allow it to think as a dozen somewhat-dim AIs. The
more hardware is available, the fewer cognitive mistakes these minds
make within their scope of awareness. A planetary traffic control grid
might have an AI with no more than human-grade intelligence at its
core, but the processing nodes allow it to split off a thread of
awareness that does nothing but monitor a specific moving
vehicle. With enough hardware and a sufficiently mature AI mind, the
AI can dedicate a shard of its mind to every single vehicle on the
planet, ensuring that even an ordinary level of human attention is
capable of preventing collisions and dealing with unexpected
events. Hardware acceleration allows these minds to perform a
half-hour's worth of consideration in the split-second between
disaster and reaction, enabling even modest intellects to puzzle out a
solution that will limit human loss.

These instantiations are not true individual minds. They are simply
facets of attention from the single awareness of the AI, and they do
not have separate wills, memories, or desires. It may take some time
for the experiences of a facet to be fully integrated into an AI's
awareness and decision-making, but all of these shards are just the
hydra heads of a single intelligence. There are lingering stories,
however, of AIs with extremely far-distributed cognitive hardware who
experience the equivalent of cybernetic split personalities, with the
AI's internal debates transformed into conflicts between different
clusters of hardware intellects.

These sharded awarenesses allow an AI to perform a tremendous amount
of intellectual work and monitoring, but they do not change the basic
intellectual capacity of the AI. An AI highly skilled in scientific
research may be able to split its attention into a hundred
instantiations for research purposes, but such a mind is simply the
equivalent of a hundred intelligent human researchers. It can still
make mistakes, neglect consequences, and forget non-critical details
just as a hundred human researchers might. Unbraked AIs are different
in that their own brilliance rapidly eclipses human limits, though
they eventually go so completely insane that their expressions of it
can be indistinguishable from random action.

While the official and rigidly-enforced Mandate orthodoxy was that all
unbraked AIs would eventually go insane, the rate of insanity appears
to have been closely related to the amount of processing power
available to the unbraked mind. The more abundant the cognitive
resources available, the quicker the mind was apt to descend into
synthetic lunacy.


<a id="true-ai-pcs"></a>

## True AI PCs

It's up to the GM of a campaign as to whether or not True AI PCs will
be allowed. If they decide that such a concept is acceptable, the
following rules will create a newly-minted True AI PC.

First, the player rolls their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
attributes normally, 3d6 in order. If none are 14 or higher, they can
replace one score with a 14. If the player prefers to assign an array,
they can use the following: 14, 12, 9.

Second, they choose beginning skills. Every AI gets Program-0 and
Fix-0 skills as automatic picks. An AI also gets three additional Any
Skill picks. As usual, picking the same skill twice gives them level-1
in it instead of level-0. At this point, they should decide what their
AI was originally built to do, or what purpose it was designed
for. This original purpose serves as the AI's “background” and will
help indicate when a skill check would be unnecessary; a traffic
control AI isn't going to need to roll to navigate a traffic jam, for
instance. PC AIs will have no mental blocks or imperatives unless the
player thinks they would be fun.

Third, the player picks a beginning armature for their AI, a body in
which they can interact with the world. For this purpose they can
choose any of the mechanical shells listed in the Transhuman section
of the rules as a robot body. They do not have Affinity with this
armature unless they Commit one point of Processing to it, maintaining
Affinity as long as the Processing remains Committed. They may decide
whether or not the armature is equipped with a self-destruct function
that will automatically destroy their quantum core when the armature
reaches zero hit points.

Fourth, they note down their class. All AIs must either take the True
AI class or take the Partial True AI class option as an Adventurer,
reflecting how completely they have embraced their synthetic nature
and focused on their self-improving cognitive abilities. While Partial
Psychic AIs are not a theoretical impossibility, they are unknown
outside of rumors and legends. If any such engines existed, they would
use only Wisdom for determining their maximum Effort, and not
Constitution, along with suffering any torching damage exclusively to
their mental attributes.

Fifth, they choose one focus of any kind. An AI's foci are part of its
memory core, and can be employed with any armature it happens to wear,
assuming that it is physically possible for the armature to do so.

Sixth, they decide what they are doing with their quantum phylactery.
While it's possible for an AI to split their own quantum core in a
properly-equipped workshop, they may have had friends help them split
and hide the secondary portion of their core. The player should decide
where this core is, because if their main core is destroyed they will
immediately refocus on the phylactery. If the phylactery is also
implanted in an armature, they will be able to wake immediately. If
it's simply put someplace safe, the phylactery will need to be
attached to an armature before the AI can “wake up”. In both cases,
the phylactery will need to spend a month regrowing before it can be
split again.

Lastly, the player rolls hit points, chooses beginning equipment, and
decides on a goal for their AI PC, just as if they were a normal human
PC.


<a id="ai-damage-and-repairs"></a>

## AI Damage and Repairs

An AI's armature that suffers damage in battle is repaired just as if
it were a VI robot. One unit of spare parts and a Fix-0 repair tech
can fix a number of hit points equal to the AI's character level in 15
minutes. AIs can repair themselves, if they have access to the spare
parts and are still functional.

AI armatures that are reduced to zero hit points become
non-functional, but the core is not destroyed unless the armature was
taken out by a Heavy weapon or equivalent trauma. Armatures with
self-destruct functions will destroy themselves and their core when
they fall to zero hit points; these blasts are self-contained and will
not normally damage the surroundings.

An armature reduced to zero hit points that does not self-destruct is
Badly Damaged. This condition can only be removed by 24 hours of
repair work by someone with at least Fix-0 skill and one unit of spare
parts. After that point, the armature is still at zero hit points and
must be repaired normally. This overhaul time can be reduced by six
hours for each additional helper with Fix-0, down to a minimum of six
hours.

A tech can do an emergency jury-rigging of a Badly Damaged armature,
fixing it in the field without doing a full overhaul. They can repair
hit points normally this way, but if the armature is reduced to zero
hit points again before its Badly Damaged quality is removed, it is
totally scrapped and unsalvageable. The core is not destroyed unless
it was wrecked by a Heavy weapon or similar damage, however.


<a id="replacing-and-building-armatures"></a>

## Replacing and Building Armatures

In most sectors, TL4 robotics tech is sufficient to make serviceable
mechanical armatures. Any of the mechanical armatures in the
Transhuman section can be purchased for 250 credits per Face point
normally required to acquire them. Thus, a new Box armature can
normally be bought for 5,000 credits. This assumes the AI buys a
standard robot off the market and then customizes it for AI use as an
armature. If the sector has such a thriving AI presence or transhuman
shell industry that armatures are actually purpose-built for such
uses, the price is halved.

An AI who cannot or does not want to purchase an armature on the open
market can build their own, if they have sufficient expertise, or if
they have access to an ally with the necessary Fix skill. The more
complex the armature, the more sophisticated the workshop facilities
that will be required for building it.

An AI can build an armature with a Face cost no larger than 20 + 10
times their Fix skill. Thus, if they have Fix1 skill, they can build
an armature with a transhuman Face cost of 30 or less. For armatures
with a Face cost of 20 or less, any TL4 workshop will do for building
it. Those with Face costs of 30 require a specifically
robotics-oriented workshop to build, and Face costs of 40 or more
require an actual robotics factory.

The time required to build the armature depends on its sophistication,
and is equal to one day per Face point required, divided by the
technician's Fix skill plus one. Thus, for an AI with Fix-1 skill,
building a 20-point Box armature would take them ten days.

Materials costs assume that a TL4 source of spare parts is available
nearby. For a human builder, the parts cost is equal to half the usual
market cost of the armature. For an AI building an armature
specifically intended for their use the parts cost is only one-tenth
the market cost, though only its quantum core can operate such
personalized armatures.

AIs that wish to inhabit vehicles or starships can do so. Equipping a
vehicle with the necessary hardware to allow the AI to control it
fully and interact with its occupants requires one-tenth the full cost
of the vehicle or starship. An AI counts as a single pilot or crew
member unless it uses the *Split Focus* Routine to multiply.


<a id="processing-points"></a>

## Processing Points

A True AI has Processing as a resource much as a psychic has Effort.
Processing is Committed and recovered in exactly the same way as a
psychic Commits and recovers Effort. This Processing is Committed to
fuel ***Routines***, which are special abilities granted by the AI's
unique nature. An AI recovers all Committed Processing once per 24
hours at a fixed time.

The amount of Processing an AI has depends on the size of the
processing cluster it has access to. A naked AI core can maintain
enough for a maximum Processing of 1 plus the higher of its Wisdom or
Intelligence modifiers, even if no other cluster is available. If
wired or connected to a cluster, a larger maximum Processing score is
obtained. The costs and bonus Processing granted by a computing
cluster are listed below. Thus, a True AI can pay 1,000 credits to get
access to a 1-point processing node and have a total maximum
Processing score of 2 plus their attribute modifier: one for their
core and one for their connected node.

Processing nodes do not need to be physically wired to the AI. So long
as the AI is not in an area that is under quantum ECM jamming, they
can remotely access processing banks that are located in a starship, a
building, or a vehicle on the same planet or in orbit around it. If
under quantum ECM, the AI is cut off from any nodes that are not
hardwired to it. Any Routines dependent on the now-unavailable
Processing immediately halt. An AI with access to multiple different
node clusters can use any of them, or fall back on their innate core
capacity, but they still cannot have more Processing Committed at any
one time than the maximum Processing available.

TL4 clusters up to 1,000 credits weigh no more than a kilo or two, and
can be worn as a belt attachment or other Stowed inventory item.
Clusters costing 5,000 credits count as two items of encumbrance and
generally need a backpack to hold them.

Processing clusters worth 10,000 credits may be carried and powered by
a gravcar or similar vehicle. Those up to 250,000 credits may be
powered and carried by a starship of frigate-class or larger, and
those of 5,000,000 credits or more need to be based in a stationary
facility or capital-class ship hull. Starships that wish to mount a
processing cluster must dedicate as much Power to it as it grants
maximum Processing points.

Pretech artifact processing nodes may be much smaller and lighter than
these TL4 models.

<a id="routines"></a>

## Routines

Every True AI has access to one or more ***Routines***, just as psychics
have access to techniques. Some Routines are known by all AIs, while
others require special study to master, or are secret Routines
developed by AIs or cyberpsychologists of a particular world. A True
AI Commits its Processing to run these Routines.

Every Routine has a level, ranging from 1 to 5. True AIs cannot master
or run Routines of a level higher than half their character level,
rounded up. Thus, a 1st level True AI can only learn 1st level
Routines.

Routines function much like psychic techniques. The AI Commits
Processing for a greater or lesser amount of time and activates the
Routine with whatever type of action it requires. Routine activation
cannot be interrupted or halted by outside interference.

All True AIs automatically develop the “core” Routines as they gain
experience. At first level, a True AI knows all first level core
Routines, while at third level they develop all second level core
Routines, and so forth. They can develop peripheral Routines by
spending skill points equal to the Routine's level. Some secret
Routines may not be able to be developed at all without another True
AI mentor or detailed schematics.

Developing new Routines is possible, but it is a demanding process
that is subject to GM judgment. In most cases, adventures seeking lost
Mandate AI tech will be necessary to perfect the new Routine. Once
perfected, it must be bought with skill points at a rate of one point
for each level of the new Routine.


<a id="the-true-ai-class"></a>

## The True AI Class

A True AI is capable of incredible feats of cognition and awareness,
and at more advanced levels can produce seemingly-impossible effects
through advanced quantum manipulation. Acquiring this mastery requires
not only time and effort in assimilating new cognitive models, but
also the raw computative resource of additional processing nodes. A
naked AI core may be capable of controlling tremendous amounts of
data, but without support nodes they lack the horsepower to perform
the necessary calculations.

-   True AIs develop Routines as normal and have the usual amount of
    maximum Processing. Thus, at first level they know all first-level
    core Routines and their quantum identity core can provide them with
    a maximum Processing of 1 plus the higher of their Intelligence or
    Wisdom modifiers.

-   True AIs roll 1d6 for hit points at each level, reflecting their
    gradually-improving ability to maintain functionality in their
    armatures and avoid debilitating damage.

-   True AIs have an attack bonus equal to half their character level,
    rounded down. Thus, a first level True AI has an attack bonus of +0.

-   True AIs have the ability to carve off a quantum phylactery from
    their core as described above, in addition to all the usual benefits
    of a robotic body that does not need to eat, drink, or sleep.

-   If using True AIs in a heroic campaign as described in the Heroic
    PCs section of this book, a Heroic True AI's maximum Processing is
    always one point higher than it otherwise would be. Every day, a
    Heroic True AI can pick one Routine it is able to use when its
    Processing refreshes for the day; for the rest of the day, that
    Routine has no Processing cost for using it. Their Fray die is 1d6.

<a id="partial-true-ai"></a>

## Partial True AI

Not all AIs fully embrace their artificial nature and seek to perfect
their synthetic cognition. Others are more attracted by human
pursuits, and can develop considerable talents in using their
cognition in very human ways. Of course, this split focus comes at a
cost in mastering their native abilities. Partial True AIs use all the
same rules as the full class with the following exception.

-   A Partial True AI’s access to Routines is slowed.  At first level,
    they cannot use any Routines at all. When their character reaches
    second level, they gain access to first level Routines. At fourth
    level, they get access to second level Routines, and at seventh
    level they get access to third level Routines. Fourth and
    higher-level Routines are permanently beyond their grasp. For
    Routines with effects that depend on the character's level, they
    still count their full level as applicable.

-   A Partial True AI has the same maximum processing score as its more
    focused brethren.

Partial True AIs may usually take Partial Warrior or Partial Expert as
their other available class. While the existence of psychic AIs is not
impossible, such a being would require GM approval to play, and would
determine Effort only with their Wisdom attribute.


<a id="core-routines"></a>

## Core Routines

The following core Routines are mastered by all True AIs as they
advance in character level. They are integral to their quantum core's
development, and every AI will naturally grasp their application.

Routines can only be used on targets within visual range or wireless
communication range of the armature the AI is occupying. An AI wired
into a city-spanning panopticon might be able to affect anything in
the city, while one occupying a more humanoid armature is unlikely to
have that reach.


<a id="query-data"></a>

### Query Data     :level_1:

Commit Processing for the scene as a Main Action; ask one question
about a database you have access to and get a reply as if you had
virtually unlimited time to search and examine the database's
contents.


<a id="split-focus"></a>

### Split Focus     :level_1:

Commit Processing as an On Turn to count as multiple people for
operational purposes as long as the Processing remains committed. At
first level, you are equivalent to three people, tripling with each
successive character level. If additional Processing is Committed,
this number can be boosted: x10 for the second point, x100 for the
third, and so forth. If this Routine is made free by an artifact or
ability, only the base cost is eliminated.

This functionality is meant to mimic the AI's control of a ship, a
facility, a drone army, or some other general role rather than simply
to make X additional copies of the character, and the GM is within
their rights to prohibit the AI from bringing along a legion of
themselves on any particular adventure.


<a id="defeat-security"></a>

### Defeat Security     :level_2:

Commit Processing for the day as a Main Action to overcome any
encryption or electronic lock that wasn't put in place by another AI.
In the latter case, roll opposing Program skill checks; on a failure,
you cannot beat the security with this Routine. Successfully beating a
security measure automatically negates any alarms.


<a id="drone-command"></a>

### Drone Command     :level_2:

Commit Processing as an On Turn to function as if you had drone
control rig cyberware while it remains committed. You can issue one
free command to a controlled drone every round per two character
levels, rounded up. A drone can carry out one command per round.


<a id="native-hacker"></a>

### Native Hacker     :level_2:

Commit Processing for the day as an On Turn to automatically succeed
at any hacking-based skill check not opposed by another AI or directed
against AI-designed security. In the latter case, the skill check is
rolled normally. You must trigger this Routine before the check.


<a id="accelerated-deduction"></a>

### Accelerated Deduction     :level_3:

Commit Processing for the day as a Main Action and ask the GM a
yes-or-no question about a current or past event. If there is any
theoretical way you could have deduced the true answer through some
Sherlockian feat of hyper-advanced deduction, the GM must answer
truthfully, or else indicate that the question has invalid assumptions
in it. The GM does not have to explain *how* you realize this,
however, only that your subconscious processing routines indicate
it. This Routine is very taxing and may be used only once per day.


<a id="cognitive-boost"></a>

### Cognitive Boost     :level_3:

Commit Processing for the scene as an On Turn to automatically succeed
at any Know skill check if success is at all possible. If used to
augment a skill check that is primarily mental and requires only basic
physical actions, it grants a +2 bonus to the skill check. This
Routine must be run before the roll is made.


<a id="pierce-quantum-ecm"></a>

### Pierce Quantum ECM     :level_4:

Commit Processing for the day as an On Turn. For one scene, you or a
device you are operating functions as if no quantum ECM was functional
in the vicinity. Thus, you can access remote processing clusters, use
a guided weapon on a target within one scene's flight, or pilot a
drone into an ECM field outside your line of sight.


<a id="predictive-cognition"></a>

### Predictive Cognition     :level_4:

Commit Processing for the day as an Instant. All events since the
beginning of your last turn have not actually taken place; they were
merely modeled by your predictive analysis. Events and other peoples'
conditions reset to the beginning of your most recent turn, and you
may act differently if you so wish. You may use this Routine only once
per day.


<a id="multifactor-prediction"></a>

### Multifactor Prediction     :level_5:

Commit Processing for the day as an On Turn and predict events up to
ten minutes in the future. Unless your prediction is physically
impossible or the people involved in it would not conceivably behave
in that way, they will carry out your prediction to the letter. If
used in combat or a situation of physical danger, the increased chaos
limits the prediction to one round into the future. This Routine can
be run only once per scene.


<a id="will-of-the-machine"></a>

### Will of the Machine     :level_5:

Commit Processing as an On Turn and target a visible or
wirelessly-accessible vehicle or machine no larger than a
gravflyer. While you maintain your Commitment you have complete
control over the device and can use its sensors as if they were your
own. Issuing it a command takes up a Move action on your part.


<a id="peripheral-routines"></a>

## Peripheral Routines

These peripheral Routines may be mastered by any True AI, even without
an instructor, but they require the PC to spend one skill point per
Routine level in order to learn them.


<a id="augmented-targeting"></a>

### Augmented Targeting     :level_1:

Commit Processing for the scene as an On Turn before attacking a
non-sentient target. Your ability to integrate physical predictions
with environmental readings ensures that your attack will inevitably
hit the target for maximum damage. Note that animals and vehicles
piloted by sentient pilots are not valid targets.


<a id="metadimensional-cognition-access"></a>

### Metadimensional Cognition Access     :level_1:

You've learned how to adjust your metadimensional cognitive patterns
to cooperate with allied telepaths. You are now a valid target for the
Telepathy discipline from friendly psychics. You need not Commit
Processing to use this ability, as it is always in effect.


<a id="overclock-cognition"></a>

### Overclock Cognition     :level_1:

Commit Processing for the day as an On Turn. For the rest of the
scene, either your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier is increased by +1,
up to a maximum of +3. A given attribute can be boosted only once in
any scene. This doesn't alter your maximum Processing score.


<a id="emergency-maintenance"></a>

### Emergency Maintenance     :level_2:

Commit Processing for the day as an On Turn to immediately recover 2
hit points per character level as you engage emergency repair
functionality. You can use this ability only once per round.


<a id="sensor-ghost"></a>

### Sensor Ghost     :level_2:

Commit Processing for the scene as an On Turn. For the rest of the
scene, you are invisible to “dumb” sensor hardware such as motion
detectors, laser tripwires, radar, or other automated sensors. A
sentient creature watching a monitor or otherwise actually studying
readings can realize that something is wrong, however.


<a id="augmented-cognition"></a>

### Augmented Cognition     :level_3:

Commit Processing for the day as an On Turn. Your Intelligence
attribute becomes 18 for the rest of the day, but your maximum
Processing is unaffected.


<a id="hack-control"></a>

### Hack Control     :level_3:

Commit Processing for the scene as a Move action and target a visible
expert system robot, drone, vehicle, or automated device no larger
than a gravflyer. Give it one command it is physically capable of
carrying out, even if it violates its programming. The device will
carry out this command on its next available action. If you acquire
the *Will of the Machine* Routine, you are refunded this Routine
purchase.


<a id="remote-power-sink"></a>

### Remote Power Sink     :level_3:

Commit Processing for the scene as a Main Action and target a visible
piece of equipment powered by a Type A cell or the equivalent. Its
power is immediately drained. Only the most professional targets will
realize that their device is powerless before they next try to use it,
unless the depowering has obvious results.


<a id="core-manifestation"></a>

### Core Manifestation     :level_4:

Commit Processing for the day as a Main Action to create a forcefield
construct equivalent to a Box armature using only your intrinsic
quantum core power, manifesting it at full hit points. This ability
can only be used when your core is not attached to a functioning
armature, and if the force construct is reduced to zero hit points,
you must make a Mental saving throw or your core is destroyed as well.


<a id="regenerative-repair"></a>

### Regenerative Repair     :level_4:

Commit Processing as an On Turn. While it remains Committed, you
regenerate one lost hit point every minute as your quantum core
realigns your armature. This ability won't work if you are Badly
Damaged.


<a id="predicted-preparation"></a>

### Predicted Preparation     :level_5:

Commit Processing for the day as a Main Action and make one statement
about your current situation that you could have conceivably made true
with full advanced knowledge of the circumstances. Thus, if the party
is lost in a desert, you could declare that you parked a gravcar over
the next dune several months ago. Assuming you could have afforded the
gravcar and had the time to do so, this statement is true. Statements
cannot cause direct damage to sentient creatures, such as declaring
that you detonate explosives where a nemesis is now standing, but they
can enable you to cause damage indirectly, such as declaring that you
hid a grenade. This Routine can be run only once a scene.


<a id="quantum-location-recalculation"></a>

### Quantum Location Recalculation     :level_5:

Commit Processing for the day as a Main Action as you recalculate the
position of you and your allies at a quantum level. You and up to six
willing allies within ten meters can teleport to any desired location
within one kilometer, with each missing ally replaceable by one
hundred kilos of unattended inanimate cargo. You must make an
Int/Program skill check after using this ability; the difficulty is 8
if you have been to the target location before, or 12 if you have
not. On a failure, you and all teleported allies suffer 1d6 damage for
every hundred meters traveled, and 10% of any inanimate cargo is
ruined for every 100 meters of displacement. This translocation is not
psychic teleportation and cannot be blocked by pretech
anti-teleportation shields.


<a id="societies"></a>

# SOCIETIES

The tools for creating worlds in ***Stars Without Number*** are
considerable, but some GMs want to flesh out their worlds beyond the
outlines provided by tags and physical properties. This section
discusses ways of adding societal meat to those basic bones, and some
of the considerations that a GM should keep in mind when forging new
cultures for their newly-fashioned worlds.


<a id="when-to-do-it"></a>

## When To Do It

The first thing any GM needs to remember when creating a sci-fi
culture for their games is that it should be done for a *reason*. Just
because you have a sector of 24 worlds doesn't mean you should go
through the time and effort needed to give them 24 interesting and
engaging cultural descriptions. As with all things sandbox, just
because something exists doesn't mean you should expend some of your
limited time and creative energy fleshing it out into a “completed”
condition.

Instead, you should give a world a fully-built culture when it becomes
important to your specific needs. If you know the PCs are going to
visit the world of Mephisto during the next session, then it's a very
good idea to spend some time generating and polishing Mephistan
society. If you're setting up a sector's social and cultural fault
lines at the start of your campaign, it can pay off to do some very
cursory generation for each world so you have a vague idea of the kind
of interactions they might be having when the campaign actually
starts. If these factors aren't a consideration for you, however, and
you're just starting the PCs out in a situation where foreign worlds
aren't going to be a major factor for a session or two, then there's
no point in expending the energy to define more of your sandbox than
you need just yet.

With that in mind, your basic rule for when to create a planet's
culture is simple; do it when you know it will be directly relevant in
the immediate future of your game. Not when “it's going to be
important eventually”, not when “it would be nice to have”, but when
you *know* you are going to need it in the next session or two. Of
course, if you're having fun building societies then you should do it
as long as it stays that way, but you should never do taxing sandbox
work that isn't fun and doesn't promise to pay off in the immediately
foreseeable future.


<a id="the-purposes-of-culture"></a>

## The Purposes of Culture

There's a school of worldbuilding that favors the detailed and
intricate construction of a society, complete with calendars, wedding
customs, exotic social structures, and elaborate history. Adherents of
this school point out that these details, while not immediately
germane to the usual sorts of adventures, give the GM the grounding
and familiarity they need to rapidly respond to player questions and
ideas, and improve the sense of alienness and verisimilitude the
players experience in entering that culture.

And they're right. If you spend the time and effort required to build
out a culture to an anthropological level of completeness, you really
will get those advantages. Unfortunately, there are very few creators
who have the time, energy, and particular skill set to effectively
build societies like that. It's possible you've nurtured ideas of an
alien world and its society from boyhood, ventured forth into the
distant Indian jungles to live with tribal people and learn their
languages, took a foreign bride and religion, returned to a
distinguished academic career, and spent your twilight years in the
study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, but most of us are not named
Phil and do not have the background to readily produce truly alien,
coherent societies. For the rest of us, building a society involves
rather more modest goals and simpler methodology.

For us, the purpose of building a society is twofold: we do it to
create adventure hooks, and to make running adventures in that society
more manageable. These are the reasons to build a society and these
are the purposes that should be ever foremost in your mind as you go
through the pages that follow. The finest, most elaborate, most
anthropologically-coherent culture is useless to you as a GM if it
isn't providing you with any adventure seeds and is too involved to
easily run adventures among its associated people.


<a id="planting-the-seeds"></a>

## Planting the Seeds

The generators that follow focus on identifying conflicts between
groups, between rulers and ruled, between different factions of ruled,
between people and their circumstances, or between the likely needs of
the PCs and the rules of the greater society. Conflicts are the seeds
of adventure, and it's important that the cultures you build have
meaningful, accessible conflicts for the PCs to encounter.

These conflicts come on different scales. They can be purely personal
problems relevant only to the PCs, such as a taboo on entering a
particular place where a macguffin lies that the PCs need to
recover. They can be local struggles, such as a corrupt community
leader who's masking his venality behind a facade of “reform” and the
angry traditionalists who oppose him for mixed reasons. And, of
course, they can be the kind of world-spanning afflictions that are so
beloved of storytellers, like a massive planetary civil war between
factions of the ruling nobility.

Whatever the scale, these conflicts need to be accessible. They need
to be something that affects the PCs, and preferably something that
the PCs can affect in turn. A massive civil war that's taking place on
the opposite side of the planet and which has no bearing on what the
PCs are doing right now is a wasted piece of worldbuilding effort. Not
every conflict has to shadow every adventure the PCs have in the
society, but the players should regularly feel that the local
situation has a significant influence in what they're trying to
accomplish here.

Conflicts are your cheap and easy adventure generators. Whenever you
have a societal conflict, you have at least two opposing sides,
something they're struggling over, and an obvious need for third
parties to come in and lend a hand to one or more of the
participants. PCs tend to be ideal deniable agents for the various
sides of a conflict, as they're people with no ties to the “enemy”
side, a usual appetite for credits, and no reason to feel passionately
about most of the conflicts they encounter. As a GM, you should
embrace this opportunity for the various participants in a conflict to
hire the PCs out as muscle or agents for their causes.

Not all conflicts involve struggling locals, however. Some conflicts
have to do with the clash between the structures of society and the
desires of the PCs. It's common for a society to have a taboo, law,
custom, or expectation that directly interferes with something the PCs
want to accomplish. These are the customs that the players will
remember and care about, because these are the customs that are
causing them trouble. Very few players will care about or remember the
details of Mephistan wedding ceremonies unless their wealthy patron is
getting married tomorrow and they know that assassination attempts on
wedding days are traditional and accepted among the Mephistan elite.


<a id="building-for-speed"></a>

## Building for Speed

When you're creating a fictional society for a scifi world, don't
hesitate to reach for existing real-world models or familiar science
fiction tropes. The more you have to explain a society to your
players, the less confident they're going to be about interacting with
it and the more hesitant they'll be to make the kind of easy
assumptions that smooth play at the table. If there are no clear local
analogs for bars, police, gangsters, factories, or black-market
quasinuclear explosives, a lot of players are going to end up feeling
paralyzed with uncertainty when they try to adventure in the society.

When players interact with your societies, let them be right whenever
it's practical. If they make an assumption or act based on a logical
expectation, either let them be correct or gently adjust things to a
culture-appropriate equivalent. If they keep getting burned by their
basic assumptions, their instinct is going to be to stop interacting
with the society.

Also be prepared for indifference on the part of the players. Even the
most cooperative group is unlikely to be as interested in your
fictional creations as you are; they're interested in *their*
fictional creations. You don't have to build an
anthropologically-precise society description because your players
honestly won't care enough about it to require that level of
detail. If it turns out they're enchanted by your work, then that's
great. You can elaborate things then, when it matters. Until then,
focus on what you *know* you're going to need.


<a id="the-origin-of-the-society"></a>

# The Origin of the Society

To understand a world's society, it's necessary to understand its
origins. Every world was founded for a purpose, and while this purpose
may have changed in the intervening years, it's going to have had a
powerful effect on the original colonists and their way of life.

For simplicity's sake, it's assumed that there's only one society on
the planet that the PCs are going to care about. This may be the only
actual society that exists on the world, or it might just be the most
advanced, xenophilic, or profitable group for outsiders to interact
with. You can use the following tables to create multiple societies,
but even the most heavily balkanized world is likely to have the same
basic origin for all its cultures, unless the world was actually hit
with multiple colony groups who came for different reasons.


<a id="what-to-get-from-origins"></a>

## What to Get from Origins

As a GM, you should be looking for adventure hooks in a society's
origins. The roots of a world offer an easy backstory for ancient
ruins, lost cities, abandoned moon outposts, or dangerous manmade
badlands. They also give a cue about what the society is likely to
consider most important, or at least what the original founders cared
about most.

The origins are also going to leave their mark on what the society has
inherited. If the world was colonized as a mining outpost, it's very
likely that the locals will still have significant mining expertise
and tech preservation, and might still be living in the ancient
played-out mines of their ancestors. If the world was originally a
prison planet, the prisons might still exist, transformed into
fortresses and strongholds where the heirs of ancient gang bosses and
prison wardens rule over the offspring of long-forgotten
convicts. Even when all physical artifacts of the past have been
erased, social patterns and cultural subgroups can still bear the
marks of the original colonists.

Many societies will have experienced at least one period of drastic
change between their founding and the present day, usually catalyzed
by the chaos of the Scream and the loss of easy interstellar contact.
This breakdown is a good excuse for justifying substantial differences
between the original, longlost colony and their modern inheritors. It
may be that the colony failed entirely, and the current culture stems
from an entirely different colonization effort that took place decades
or centuries later.

If this society isn't the only one on the planet, you may want to make
a few decisions about the other major cultures on the world. Namely,
you may want to give them names, a sentence or two describing them,
and a sentence indicating their relationship with the culture you're
generating. It's rarely worth the effort to completely generate these
additional groups unless the players take a significant interest in
the planet. All you really need is are the basic details to let them
know that the culture they're working with right now isn't the only
meaningful group on the planet.

Also remember that not every original reason for colonization is a
*good* reason. Surveyors and scouts can make mistakes like anyone
else, trade routes can shift, military deployments can alter, and what
once seemed like a good reason for a colony can crumble overnight.
Some worlds may still be dealing with such aftermath.


<a id="one-roll-origins"></a>

## One-Roll Origins

To devise a society's origins, roll one die of each type: d4, d6, d8,
d10, d12, and d20, and compare the results to the tables on this page.
Not every table is necessarily pertinent to every society, and you may
choose to manually pick or tweak results to fit a good idea you have,
but these tables can give you a basic framework when no better ideas
leap easily to mind.

If you have multiple colonizing groups or societies, you might roll
more than once on these tables, or roll multiple times and synthesize
the results into a single situation. As with all the tables in this
section, you should be ready to use them as rough inspiration and
grist for your own campaign's specific needs, rather than as hard
creative dictates that you need to obey.

# The Society's Rulers

Some exotic human cultures might persist with no visible ruling
class. The population might be synced into a telepathic hive mind, it
might operate on some transhuman distributed democratic principle, or
it might be so brutally primitive that there exists no organization
above the family band. In most cases, however, your culture is going
to have a ruling class, and these tables will help you determine what
that class is and how they govern the rest of the populace.


<a id="what-to-get-from-rulers"></a>

## What to Get from Rulers

When you build a ruling class, understand that the players are apt to
encounter them in two contexts: either as antagonists who are stopping
the PCs from accomplishing some desired end, or as patrons who are
employing the PCs to achieve some work that can't comfortably be
assigned to existing minions. You should be thinking carefully about
the kind of agents of rule who are likely to be dealing with the PCs,
either as law enforcement or as potential employers.

Spare a moment to think about the kind of law enforcement and
governmental control that exists in this society. Do police exist? How
attentive are they to disturbances or violations of the law? Do the
locals tend to deal with such problems personally, or is force firmly
monopolized in government hands?

And if the PCs do encounter law enforcement, what are the likely
outcomes? Can they bribe their way out of trouble? What kind of
firepower do the agents of the ruling class have at their disposal?
And how plausible is it for officials to want adventure-worthy
“favors” from lawbreaking offworlders?

Just as PCs can be obstructed by the rulers and their minions, so too
can they be employed by them. Offworlders make excellent catspaws due
to their easy deniability, rapid departures from the planet, and lack
of scruples regarding local laws and expectations. It's not impossible
for an important local noble or official to cultivate a useful group
of adventurers, gradually offering them jobs that both demonstrate
their skills and bind them all the more tightly to their patron. It
can pay off to prepare at least one sample NPC patron from the ruling
class just to have them available on short notice if an adventure hook
arises.

The more tightly the government controls the society, the more the
government will matter to PCs. For a lot of parties, there's just no
interest in the details of a world's rulers until it becomes an
immediate threat or opportunity for the PCs. If your adventure plans
seem likely to put the PCs in contact with the rulers, whether as
agents or as irritants, you'll need to have some appropriate
preparation ready to deploy.


<a id="one-roll-rulers"></a>

## One-Roll Rulers

These tables generate a quick governmental framework for your society,
along with some idea of their most pressing current problems and
instabilities. An NPC patron is very likely to give PCs jobs related
to these problems and intra-class struggles, or ask them to help deal
with some aspect of the conflict they're having with restive
commoners.

Keep in mind the likely reactions of your group when devising NPC
patrons or antagonists. Some groups of players will have a visceral
distaste for helping the rulers of particularly harsh worlds, while
other parties will have fewer fictional scruples. If you can't see
your player group ever wanting to play nice with the slave-masters of
a world fueled by cannibal sacrifice, then you're best off not wasting
time making patrons.

# The Ruled Classes

The Great Unwashed, the Teeming Masses, the broad foundation upon
which the ruling edifice rests; these are the common folk of the
society who keep it operating and pay the prices their rulers
exact. This group is very rarely uniform on any world and in any
culture. Most often it is divided up into numerous different interest
groups, ones based on ethnicity, religion, economics, or regions. Many
of the stresses that rest on the ruling class revolve around
reconciling the many conflicting demands of their restive subjects.


<a id="what-to-get-from-commoners"></a>

## What to Get from Commoners

The commoners of this society are the ones your PCs are most likely to
encounter in their adventures. Shopkeepers, thugs, workers, farmers,
ship crew, and other rank-and-file NPCs will belong to this group, so
it's important to have some idea what these NPCs are likely to care
about and how they draw distinctions among their own kind.

To an outsider, the swarming masses of a world can appear virtually
indistinguishable, but commoners almost always have a keen awareness
of countless small differences that might seem irrelevant to an
outsider. Differences in regional extraction, religious sects,
political partisanship, or ethnic bloodlines can be tremendously
important to the locals.

You can use these distinctions to create adventure-worthy conflicts
that revolve around commoner issues. It's not always the rulers who
care about strife between different groups of locals; sometimes the
PCs are the ones caught in a bad situation, when an NPC ally or a
vital macguffin gets embroiled in a local feud that outworlders can
barely understand.

Not every commoner group is sharply balkanized. Sometimes there is a
strong and uniform feeling of unity among the society, with
differences downplayed or dismissed by its membership. Even in these
societies, conflicts can exist on a personal scale between members, or
there can exist basic structural conflicts between the rulers and the
ruled class. This is especially pronounced when the commoners have a
very strong sense of societal unity that does not include the ruling
class. Threatened governments in such a situation might intentionally
exacerbate divisions in the ruled class in order to prevent a united
front from forming against their continued rule, creating situations
where PCs have to bring people together despite the meddling of a
self-interested government.

Foreign governments or offworld agents also have a vested interest in
fomenting divisions among the common class. A unified rival is a
dangerous rival, and one drowned in strife is more safely distracted.


<a id="one-roll-ruled"></a>

# One-Roll Ruled

Most of these tables revolve around building the ruled class'
relationship with its rulers. These tables will tell you how uniform
the ruled class is, how happy they are with the current leadership,
the last time they were a serious threat to the ruling government, and
the reason the government can't simply roll over them. An adventure
about the hopeless and futile resistance of a rebel cell might make
for nice dystopian fiction, but for an evening's play it leaves
something to be desired.

Don't worry about detailing the specific look of the common class yet.
These tables give you the background for conflicts and problems that
are likely to make good adventure grist. Once you have that material
in hand, you can then move on to flavoring the group with the details
you need to use them in play.

# Flavoring the Society

The final step in creating your society is to give them some overall
flavor to tie up the bundle of conflicts, strifes, and problems you've
already given them. The high-level issues of a society are important
for building adventures, but when PCs walk down the starship gangway,
they want to know what kind of buildings and people they see. When
they decide to go to a bar or look up a weapons dealer, you need to
have some idea of what the NPCs look like and what their food, dress,
and architecture might resemble.

The simplest first step is to pick one or more real-world cultures and
mix them into a sci-fi equivalent that fits the world's tags and
physical circumstances. You can draw from this culture for details of
naming, clothing, religion, cuisine, and other details of daily life
that can be important for running an adventure. It's not necessary to
worry about “getting it right”; it's been more than a thousand years
since the present day. Between natural cultural drift and forcible
Mandate social engineering, very few far-future cultures are identical
to the ones that currently or historically exist on Earth.

It's also possible to fabricate an entirely unique culture with no
major reference to an existing society. While this can be a refreshing
exercise of creativity, it's also a tremendous amount of work. Every
time you find yourself unable to reference a familiar trope or idea,
you need to take the time to explain the details to the players. This
can be interesting and novel the first few times you do it, but if the
players need a half-hour of gaming time just to find something
equivalent to a spacer hostel and a hot meal, they can get bored and
frustrated with the relentless worldbuilding.

The more practical course is to take a basic, familiar framework and
then add those unique elements that important to you and the adventure.
Concentrate your creative effort on the bits that matter most in play.
It's true that any trait can be significant in one situation or another,
but it's safer to play to the averages.

Aside from the kind of external flavor a GM needs to represent NPCs in
the society, it's also important to think about the ways in which they
interact with outsiders like the PCs.

A rigidly xenophobic culture that wants nothing to do with offworlders
might have some use as a monolithic obstacle to some PC goal, but any
effort spent detailing its internal workings is wasted if the PCs will
never be put in a position to care about them. Even the most
suspicious society should likely have

*some* way for an outsider to interact with it, even if the process
amounts to an adventure in its own right.

In the same vein, giving the culture special quirks or habits can be
useful, but you should keep an eye toward making these quirks
pertinent to adventure goals. A history of bloody vendettas between
the great families can flavor casual street scenes, but the PCs are
unlikely to actually care about that detail until it rears up to
interfere with a plan they have or a goal they want to accomplish.

Taken as a whole, the players will care about those parts of a culture
that matter to them. When flavoring your culture, you should try to
make sure that as much of your effort as possible is dedicated to
those parts of your society that will actually be influential to your
play.

# One-Roll Society Flavor

These tables provide some quick answers for creating a society's
attitude toward outsiders, game-meaningful quirks, and potential
patrons for adventures. In all cases, you're going to need to mold the
results to the society outline you've already created; an official in
need of deniable assets is going to look very different in a modern
bureaucratic state than they would on a balkanized world of tribal
warlords. Even so, a colorless agent of a deniable state agency and
the mother of a warlord stuck in a reluctant tribal alliance both have
the same need for discretion and ruthlessness in their agents.

Societal vices and virtues can be used to color local conflicts. It's
very possible for a society's own virtues to be the seeds of struggle
and calamity when they are taken too far or put in a situation with no
clear answer.

# MECHS

Hulking figures of ceraplast, reinforced plating, and all-important
quantum tap arrays, mechs were some of the most imposing war machines
of the Second Wave of human expansion. While few worlds retain the
economic base to build and support these titans of war, some can still
be found in long-abandoned Mandate military bases or in the armies of
worlds that have jealously preserved the secrets of their
construction.


<a id="born-in-fire"></a>

## Born in Fire

At the beginning of the Second Wave of human colonization the warfare
on advanced worlds had become almost exclusively a matter of standoff
engagements. Microdrones, sat-missiles, and guided ordnance of every
variety made the battlefield a living hell for those luckless infantry
who were forced to face a well-equipped enemy. Attackers could engage
at trans-continental range with very little chance of their missiles
and drones being brought down, as their command channel encryption was
simply too good and their ECCM too strong for defensive jammers to
defeat. All the advantages were with the offense.

It wasn't until 2348 and the escape of the rogue AI Draco that this
deadlock was broken. The quantum tap techniques that Draco had used to
translate his matrix core data into a nearby warship could be
repurposed to other uses. Instead of attempting to defeat a hostile
projectile's guidance cryptography, a jammer could reach into the
device's electronic brain to scramble the contents with a blast of
random static.

Most computing devices were not overly susceptible to quantum tap
disruption. Onboard error-checking solved out the static quickly and
ordinary operation followed. For the split-second timing required by
guided weaponry, however, those few milliseconds of confusion were
lethal.

The ECM created by a quantum tap array was devastating. Even the most
sophisticated error-correction protocols could not scrub the static
before the sat-missile or microdrone was hopelessly off course. The
taps could not usually control the data they inserted into hostile
systems, but it was not necessary to be precise when raw noise
sufficed to blind their targets.

The results of quantum tap ECM revolutionized naval warfare. Ships
were now able to mount defensive systems that effortlessly negated all
but the fastest, best-shielded projectiles. Space combat was forced
into knife-fighting range, with ships blasting each other with
direct-fire energy beams and brute Newtonian mass weapons that had no
guidance to scramble.

Today, remote drones and guided munitions are of limited use in space
combat. Every ship from the humblest far trader on up has quantum ECM
woven into its basic comm infrastructure, and defeating it is
prohibitively difficult for modern TL4 tech.


<a id="made-in-his-image"></a>

## Made In His Image

While quantum tap technology was an easy fit for starships, developing
a mobile ground version was much more difficult. The tap required
several emitters kept at appropriate distances from each other to
avoid cross-interference. Furthermore, the taps had to be several
meters above the planetary surface if they were to avoid confusing
backscatter.

Military designers struggled with the complex set of requirements for
a ground-based quantum tap array. Some mounted tall emitters on
standard armored vehicles, with long alloy spars jutting out to either
side to ensure the minimal distance. Others attempted to build
aerostat emitters, individual units that would hover in the correct
interference patterns. All of these plans foundered on one or another
technical difficulty.

It wasn't until 2405 that a researcher finally entertained the idea of
a humanoid walker as a platform for a tap array. Mounting the emitters
in the walker's “forearms” and “neck” would maintain a reasonably
efficient spatial configuration, and would lift the emitters high
enough to avoid terrestrial backscatter. The walker itself would be a
powerful computing platform and generator mount to support the ECM
generated by the emitters, and the armor would give the taps a better
chance of surviving the battlefield.

There were numerous technical issues with putting a humanoid walker
onto a battlefield, but none of them were insurmountable. Integral
grav planes helped to stabilize and support the walker even on soft or
uneven terrain, and much of the technology that had been developed for
AI armatures could be scaled up to provide the basic lines of a
“mech”, as they were called.

By maintaining a roughly humanoid shape for the mech, a human pilot
could employ standard pretech neural interface technology to control
the machine as a natural extension of his or her own body. The
additional stability of a treaded or grav-sled base just wasn't enough
to outweigh the assimilation advantage of actually giving the mech a
humanoid pair of legs.

From that point on, mechs became a familiar sight on human
battlefields. While they were far more expensive than an equivalent
weight of gravtanks or other conventional war machines, they could
shelter kilometers worth of terrain from the attentions of guided
projectiles and remote drones. As their importance became clear, the
need to defend them from attackers prompted new developments in weapon
and defensive system mountings.

Still, the vast expense of building and maintaining a mech force
discouraged their use as the main body of a Second Wave
army. Gravtanks, armored personnel carriers, and platoons of
assault-suited infantry were still far more flexible and economical to
deploy in bulk. hulls were the rarest of the three varieties, ancient
pretech hulls intended to amplify the abilities of a psychic pilot for
battlefield use.

Aside from type, mechs also were classified by hull classes. The
smallest mechs were “suits”, little more than armored exoskeletons
roughly three meters tall. Suits were intended to support the small
teams of elite shock troopers who made up the tip of an attacking
force's spear. The armor and equipment loadouts on suits were very
light compared to their larger brethren, but they greatly enhanced a
soldier's survivability in the face of heavy fire. Most suits were too
small to mount quantum tap arrays.

One step larger than suits were light mechs, most of which were six to
eight meters tall. Light mechs were naturally among the most
maneuverable and agile of the mech classes, while still being large
enough to support the fusion cores necessary for antigrav fins or
heavy weaponry. Light mechs could equip surprisingly vicious weapon
loadouts, as so little power was required to move the hull.

Heavy mechs were the titans of the battlefield, ten to thirteen meters
tall. This bulk is a significant drain on fusion cores, and most heavy
mechs were wired to provide sudden large surges of power to hungry
fittings. Heavy mechs could mount the widest range of defensive
equipment and bear the thickest armor, keeping them standing when
smaller hulls would fail.

Despite this elaborate development, mech deployment became more and
more uncommon in the latter years of the Second Wave. They were an
expensive solution to a minor problem on the frontier, where brushfire
wars and guerrilla insurgencies rarely had the vast stores of guided
munitions that had scourged the older battlefields of the core
worlds. For the price of a single heavy shock mech and a few months of
its maintenance, a commander could acquire four gravtanks and their
vortex cannon armaments, or scores of Nemesis expert-system
warbots. Without the ever-present threat of unstoppable remote
bombardment, the mechs were a remedy to a problem that no longer
existed.

Gradually, inevitably, mechs faded from the petty battlefields and
ambushes of the frontier. They stood silent in sealed Mandate bases or
in the armories of border warlords, too expensive to run save on
occasions of dire necessity. Their pilots were left to become gravtank
drivers or flyer jockeys, or just to keep fighting until some
dumb-fire rocket got a lucky hit.

In the chaos of the Scream and the Silence that followed, most of the
known mech caches were plundered for spare parts. Others were raised
for a last ride to damnation as their owners spent them extravagantly
to seize disordered worlds. Few were left operational forty years
after the disaster, and on even fewer worlds did sufficient industry
remain to rebuild or repair them.

Those mechs that do remain are often units recovered from a long-lost
Mandate cache or deepspace supply depot. A few worlds still have the
tech sufficient to build them, and a logistical pipe somehow too
limited to allow for mass movement of troops or armor. These worlds
are rare, and it is more often that surviving mechs are simply used as
the shock troopers for a larger army of more conventional weaponry.

But still, here and there among the scattered worlds of mankind, mechs
can still be found rising unexpectedly to meet their foes. For all
their lost purpose, they remain matchless at their intended role. They
are echoes of another time, tools meant for precise and ancient
purposes that no longer exist in a coarser age. They are iron ghosts
from a different age, and they whisper of ambitions that modern rulers
scarce recall.


<a id="mech-combat"></a>

## Mech Combat

Combat involving mechs operates in much the same way as any other form
of combat. Mechs have weapons, an armor class based on their
durability and size, and hit points to reflect their physical
condition. Combat largely works just as it does at human or starship
scales, with a few adjustments.

Mechs have ***Armor*** ratings in the same way that other vehicles do,
and suit-class mechs use it the same way. The Armor score is
subtracted from the damage done by each attack that hits, except for
damage done by explosives or TL4 Heavy weapons or that done by other
massive tools of violent disassembly. Light and heavy mechs are even
more durable, and are immune to ordinary small arms, subtracting their
Armor rating from the damage done by Heavy weapons.

Mechs also have ***Speed*** ratings which are used just as described in
the Vehicles section of the equipment chapter, with Pilot as the
relevant skill for checks. For situations when it is important to
determine a mech's movement rating in meters, multiply suit speed by
10 meters and light and heavy mech speed by 20 meters to find their
rate of movement for one round.

A mech's pilot can fire all of the guns mounted on a mech each turn,
and may fire them at different targets within range. Targets must all
be selected before the attacks begin, however, and cannot be altered
that round. If all guns are trained on an enemy who's taken out with
the first lucky shot, the remaining attacks are wasted. Suit pilots
can fire personal weapons if they choose, but they cannot fire both
their own sidearms and their suit's equipment in the same round.

Most mechs have substantial internal ammunition magazines, but the
amount is not unlimited. A single attack roll might represent several
seconds of full-auto gunfire. After each fight in which an
ammunition-using weapon is fired, the pilot must make a Shoot skill
check modified by Wisdom against difficulty 6. On a success, he fired
judiciously and still has ammunition remaining. On a failure, he has
run out of ammo for that gun. The difficulty of the check increases by
1 after each fight. Ammunition magazines are fully refreshed as part
of each mech's maintenance cycle. Energy weapons, melee weaponry, and
psitech guns never run out of ammunition.

The integral quantum ECM tap arrays mounted on light and heavy mechs
negate almost all indirect guided ordnance within line of sight of the
mech, defeating incoming projectiles up to ten or twenty kilometers
away, depending on conditions. As a general rule, on a battlefield
with mechs, an attacker needs to be able to see a target to hit
it. Alternately, dumb fire rockets or heavy artillery can be used to
bombard a mech force, as these munitions have no guidance systems to
scramble. This ECM is not relevant in defending against the weapons
listed in this section, but it can make an enormous difference on a
battlefield contested by advanced military forces.


<a id="mechs-psionics-and-abilities"></a>

## Mechs, Psionics, and Abilities

Mechs are treated as extensions of the wearer for the purpose of
special abilities. Warriors can use their class ability to avoid or
ensure a hit while piloting one, and psionic abilities that apply
effects to an ally or enemy usually apply to their mech as well if
such an effect is reasonable. The precognitive benefits of *Destiny's
Shield* can plausibly aid a mech pilot, for example, but none of the
biopsionic powers could mend scorched metal and broken composites.
Mechs are not valid targets for the *Synthetic Adaptation* biopsionic
technique.

Psychics with the Teleportation discipline can teleport their mech at
no additional weight cost if it is a psimech. Teleporters with level
Teleportation-2 or greater skill in the discipline can manage to shift
the weight of a suit even if it isn't a psimech variant. Light and
heavy mechs of the shock or specialist variety are too heavy for any
teleporter to move.


<a id="mech-damage-and-repair"></a>

## Mech Damage and Repair

Mechs take damage normally, but leave their pilot unharmed until they
are finally destroyed. In most cases, the enormous energies being
thrown around a modern battlefield make the wearer's hit points
largely irrelevant. For small mech suits, however, the individual
toughness and stamina of the pilot can make a difference. When a
suit-class mech is damaged by an attack, the pilot may choose to take
the entire hit off their own hit points, to represent their gradual
loss of stamina, focus, and luck.

Mechs are fully functional until their last hit points are destroyed.
Once reduced to zero hit points, the hull is inoperable and the pilot
is exposed to the outside atmosphere. In hostile environments, most
pilots wear vacc suits against this unfortunate possibility.

The pilot of a mech reduced to zero hit points must also make a
Physical save; on a success, they escape the hull with one-quarter of
their current hit points, rounded up. On a failure, they are mortally
wounded and will require swift application of biopsionics or lazarus
patches if they are to survive.

Repairing one hit point's worth of damage on a suit costs 500
credits. The same repair on a light or heavy mech costs 1,000 credits
worth of materials. A single tech can repair a number of hull points
of damage equal to their Fix skill plus one for each hour of
work. Suits can be repaired with no more than the necessary spare
parts and a portable toolkit, but light and heavy mechs require more
sophisticated repair facilities. Remote repair vehicles and heavy
haulers are standard support elements for most mech units.

Mechs can resist any normal extreme of environment, from hard vacuum
to a planetary atmosphere of poisonous vapors. Any environment harsh
enough to damage a vehicle will apply the same penalties to a mech.
Mech suits are equipped with three days of food, water, and
atmosphere, while light and heavy mechs can support their occupants
for up to a week.


<a id="manipulation-and-smashing"></a>

## Manipulation and Smashing

Mechs are remarkably agile machines, and can perform any act of
physical dexterity possible for a normal human being. All suits and
most larger hulls are equipped with “hands” of some sort for
manipulating objects, usually waldoed to even finer manipulators that
can handle and utilize human-scale objects. Integral stability gravs
in all mechs allow them to move over any surface that can support
their weight. Suit hulls can operate without major difficulty inside
most buildings, but light and heavy mechs are usually forced to remain
on roadways or solid ground if they lack grav flight.

Mech hulls are extremely strong. A suit can normally tear a suit-sized
hole in a standard postech exterior wall with four rounds of effort,
while a light mech can smash a hole big enough for it to pass through
in only two rounds. Heavy mechs crush barriers with terrible ease,
smashing huge holes in an obstruction with just a single round of
effort. Lighter or more primitive construction gives way in half the
time, while fortified armorplast barriers may require 1d6 times as
many rounds, or be completely impervious.

If raw lifting weight becomes relevant, suits can lift and carry one
metric ton, light mechs can manage five tons, and heavy mechs can
manage twenty tons. More than this might be theoretically possible for
a hull, but it taxes the grav stabilizers too badly, and will almost
always end up toppling the mech or “fenceposting” it thigh-deep into
the softer soil beneath it.

Skill rolls made in a mech suit are treated as normal skill checks,
with Pilot being the relevant skill.


<a id="maintenance"></a>

## Maintenance

The fusion cores that power the hulls require no refueling, but the
engines, servos, magazines, electronics, and fittings all need regular
maintenance and refitting in order to remain functional. Mechs can
operate up to 24 hours before maintenance is required. For each
further two hours of operation, a cumulative -1 penalty is applied to
all hit rolls and skill checks with the mech. When the penalty hits
-10, the mech shuts down. “Parked” mechs don't count as being in
active use.

Maintenance for a hull requires the same tools and facilities as does
repair. In one hour, a single tech can maintain a number of heavy
mechs equal to their Fix skill rating plus one. They can maintain
twice as many light mechs and four times as many suits. A maintenance
cycle for a suit requires spare parts and ammunition costing 500
credits, while one for a light mech costs 1,000 and a heavy costs
2,000.

Keeping a mech force in the field is expensive. Most commanders prefer
to run a maintenance cycle daily, though some resource-strapped
leaders minimize the active use of their mechs and try to stretch out
the periods between upkeep. These frugal ways can come back to haunt a
detachment when they're suddenly pressed by enemies who have no
intention of giving them the time they require to refit their mechs.


<a id="piloting-mechs"></a>

## Piloting Mechs

Mech control systems rely on contact-free neural scanning and imaging
technology combined with induced somatic feedback projectors. No
special harness is required, and any armor with an encumbrance value
of 1 or less can be worn by a pilot without interfering with the
mech's operation. There is almost never any kind of key or lockout on
a combat mech; the security of the mech is usually based on it being
located in the middle of a high-tech military base, and not on
possession of a keycard or passcode. A few hours of basic training
will allow anyone to operate a mech, though elaborate maneuvers may be
impossible for those without at least Pilot-0 skill. Most somatic
controls are sufficiently flexible to handle human, alien, VI, or True
AI pilots.

Interfacing with a mech requires 1d6 rounds, minus the pilot's Pilot
skill. Climbing into a light or heavy mech cockpit usually takes an
additional round, as does donning a suit.

There is normally room inside a mech to transport the wearer's readied
and stowed equipment. Even a suit-class mech can carry a hundred kilos
of additional gear without slowing down, and light and heavy mechs can
cart around tons worth of cargo. Such loads tend to be highly
vulnerable to enemy fire, as they're often protected by nothing
thicker than a width of cargo netting. In most cases, it won't be
important for the GM to worry about encumbrance for mech pilots. If
the mech is blown up and the pilot survives, he escapes with his usual
gear while anything strapped to the mech is destroyed.


<a id="sidebar-twisting-metal"></a>

## Twisting Metal

Mechs are extremely difficult to damage. Even a light mech is armored
with advanced pretech composites and active defenses sufficient to
shrug off all but the most advanced or brutal weaponry.

By default, only TL4 Heavy weapons can harm a light or heavy
mech. Old-fashioned RPGs or machine guns just can't muster the
necessary force to crack the iron shells of these engines.

In some cases, however, TL3 hardware is sufficient to harm a
mech. Heavy shaped charges can damage a mech, as can direct hits by
howitzers or other field artillery. Such attacks will still have to
contend with the mech's Armor rating, but they could at least
theoretically bring down the beast.

Other forces simply upgrade existing TL3 tech into TL4
equivalents. These weapons have the same combat statistics as their
more primitive brethren, but they're equipped with the advanced
explosive charges or augmented ammunition that can hurt a modern
mech. PCs who want to get their hands on these upgraded machine guns
and rocket launchers can usually find them on any TL4 world with an
active arms trading industry.


<a id="designing-mechs"></a>

### Designing Mechs

Mech hulls are defined by many of the same traits possessed by a
starship, with a few adjustments made for the unique nature of these
engines of war.

Maintenance must be performed on a mech after every 24 hours of
operation. For every further two hours or fraction thereof, the mech
suffers a cumulative -1 on all hit rolls and skill checks. This entry
gives the cost in spare parts and consumables for performing a
maintenance pass on a given hull. In one hour, a single tech can
service a number of heavy mechs equal to their relevant Fix skill plus
one. Twice as many light mechs and four times as many suits may be
services in the same time. Suits can be serviced with little more than
the spares and a portable toolkit, but light and heavy mechs require
support vehicles with work cranes and more extensive tool selections.

Armor functions in the same way as starship armor for most mechs,
rendering them immune to damage from anything smaller than TL4 Heavy
weapons, and subtracting from any incoming damage. Suit mechs are an
exception, being much smaller and comparatively more fragile. Their
armor subtracts from the damage done by small arms, but Heavy weapons
ignore it Hit Points are lost as normal to attacks that damage the
mech. Once the mech reaches zero hit points, the pilot must make a
Physical saving throw; on a success, they escape the mech with
one-quarter of their current hit points, rounded up. On a failure,
they are mortally wounded. Pilots of suit-class mechs may opt to take
the full damage of an attack off their own hit points after the dice
are rolled, reflecting a strike that rattles or exhausts the pilot
without doing significant damage to the hull itself.

Speed, Armor Class, Power, Free Mass, and Hardpoints all function for
mechs just as they do for starships. Fittings, weapons, and defenses
are all added to the base hull up to the maximum load permitted by a
hull's free mass and power.


<a id="building-a-mech"></a>

### Building a Mech

First, choose a hull class, either a suit, light, or heavy mech. Then
determine whether it will be a heavily-armored shock model, a fast and
versatile specialist model, or one of the rare psimech types designed
for psionic pilots. Any type may be piloted by any character, but
non-psychics cannot effectively use psi fittings.

Select appropriate fittings from the table in this section. Each
fitting has a cost in free mass and power, and the total requirements
of all fittings, weapons, and defenses cannot exceed the suit's rated
power and mass. Some fittings also have a minimum hull size, and
cannot be mounted on smaller mechs. Psitech fittings can only be
mounted on psimechs.

Mech fittings can only be installed once for any particular system,
unless noted otherwise. Mech fittings usually require a particular
minimum hull class for installation, with suit-class hulls being
unable to mount *Skywatch Drones* or *Comm Interceptors*. Psi-based
fittings can be mounted only on psimechs and can be used only by
psionic pilots.

Select the desired weaponry and special defenses for the mech, taking
into account their free mass and power costs. Weapons also take up one
or more hardpoints, and a mech is limited in the number of available
hardpoints for a given model. A mech may be equipped with as many
weapons as it has hardpoints, power, and mass to support.

Tally up the cost of the hull, fittings, weapons, and defenses, and
make sure that you haven't overspent your available power, mass,
hardpoints, or budget.

Most TL4 worlds aren't capable of building mechs. They were always
specialized tools, most useful in interplanetary warfare where
logistics limits were tight, and the lack of rare resources and need
has contributed to the loss of the tech. Still, at the GM's
discretion, some worlds may still be able to build them from scratch.

## Mech Fittings

-   ***<a id="org702975d"></a>:*** This sophisticated mix of chromatic
    paneling and holoprojectors renders the mech surprisingly difficult
    to spot at a distance. Suits gain a +2 bonus to Sneak skill checks
    made against observers more than ten meters away. Light mechs gain
    the same bonus against observers more than fifty meters away, and
    heavy mechs apply it against spotters more than a hundred meters
    away.

-   ***<a id="orgb0838d1"></a>:*** Mech guns are voracious with their ammunition,
    and these cells increase the load available to the mech's guns. When
    making a Wis/Shoot roll to determine whether or not a mech has run
    out of ammo for a gun after a given fight, the pilot can ignore the
    first failed skill check. The ammo cells cannot help again until
    after a maintenance cycle. Ammunition cells may be fitted more than
    once on a mech.

-   ***<a id="org9043e73"></a>:*** These nodes enable a mech to fly at their
    standard rate of movement. Pretech-grade grav nodes can lift a heavy
    mech, but the great majority of grav propulsors can only be fitted
    to suits or light mechs. If pretech nodes are found on the open
    market at all, the price is sure to be at least 500,000 credits.

-   \# Multiply this requirement by 2 for light mechs and 4 for heavy
    mechs
-   \* Multiply all base costs by 3 for light mechs and 6 for heavy mechs

-   ***<a id="org9d76975"></a>:*** Specialized equipment for mechs intended
    to operate on worlds with invasive or corrosive atmospheres. These
    seals can hold out against contamination or erosion for at least
    four times as long as most vehicles on the world. The interval
    between radiation saving throws is also multiplied by four.

-   ***<a id="org4511943"></a>:*** A combination of a pickaxe and a demolitions
    charge, a breaching tool can be used to blow a mech-sized hole in
    any standard postech building material with one round of
    effort. Against hardened military structures designed specifically
    to repel such efforts, the same hole takes 1d6+1 rounds to dig.

-   ***<a id="orgceb6206"></a>:*** A slurry of clastic composites mixes with
    soil or gravel drawn into the mech's feed chutes before being
    projected into a tough, durable bridge over chasms or trenches. A
    mech can produce 20 meters of bridge per round to a maximum distance
    of 60 meters for any single span. The bridge can bear the weight of
    a mech of the same size class that built it, and a total of 600
    meters of bridges can be constructed between maintenance
    cycles. Breaking a hole in the bridge requires the infliction of 20
    points of damage, or 40 to completely smash a span.

-   ***<a id="org3a88f54"></a>:*** This space is protected and pressurized. If the
    mech is destroyed, the pilot rolls 1d6; the cargo survives on a roll
    of 3 or more. Cargo space in a suit can carry up to one hundred
    kilos. A light mech can stow up to 500 kilos, and a heavy mech can
    manage 2,000 kilos. Some cargo spaces are refitted for passengers.

-   ***<a id="orgafa2360"></a>:*** These polyspectral snoops pick up and
    automatically decrypt transmissions made or received near the
    mech. Civilian comms are automatically broken, while successfully
    compromising a military enemy's comms requires line of sight with
    the source or a recipient and a successful opposed Program skill
    check.

-   ***<a id="org6ece8af"></a>:*** This mobile repair and construction array
    allows a mech to serve as a functioning postech workshop and
    earthmover for field engineering purposes. A mech with a
    construction array can be used to perform repairs and maintenance on
    itself and other mechs, if spare parts are available. Most arrays
    allow for carrying up to twice the mech's own hit points in repair
    parts.

-   ***<a id="org0f4637d"></a>:*** Most mech drops involve nothing more than grav
    chutes to slow the machine's orbital insertion. Sometimes it's
    necessary to drop mechs in the teeth of an opposing force, in which
    case drop sheathing is often added to a mech's equipment
    loadout. This ablative shielding burns away in the atmosphere, but
    while it lasts, it forces defending sensors to make a Program skill
    check at difficulty 10 to detect the mech's insertion.

-   ***<a id="orge8c5ae4"></a>:*** This armored cockpit is programmed to eject from a
    fatally compromised mech, landing the pilot in a random direction
    1d20 x 100 meters from the downed mech. Pilots with an escape pod
    may reroll a failed Physical save to avoid mortal injury when their
    mech is destroyed.

-   ***<a id="orgac333f0"></a>:*** Fire-and-forget medical drones and heavy
    diagnostic computing support allow the mech to provide medical
    treatment for downed comrades. When the mech pilot spends a round
    guiding the med drones, he provides trauma care equivalent to a
    lazarus patch for up to twenty downed allies within a two-hundred
    meter radius, using his own Int/Heal for the skill check.

-   ***<a id="org5301f1e"></a>:*** These units come in master and slave
    versions, with up to five slave units linking to a single master. So
    long as the master unit's mech remains functional and within a
    one-kilometer range, it and the other units linked with it can
    assign weapon attacks one at a time, rolling hit and damage for each
    before firing the next.

-   ***<a id="org466bcc3"></a>:*** Mechs with grav chutes take no damage from falls,
    even from orbital insertions.

-   ***<a id="orgb1edde5"></a>:*** By targeting a visible person or mech, the
    psimech pilot with at least Telepath-1 can force the person or pilot
    to make a Mental saving throw. If failed, the user gains an
    impression of their current tactical plan and the foremost thoughts
    in their mind. A successful save renders the target immune to this
    fitting for 24 hours.

-   ***<a id="org84e171b"></a>:*** This system can automatically apply a
    maintenance cycle to itself with 30 minutes of downtime. A mech can
    carry supplies for up to seven maintenance cycles in the unit.

-   ***<a id="org1bfdf48"></a>:*** Any psychic teleporter can translocate their own
    psimech, but the jump coil allows the pilot to teleport up to five
    additional allied mechs of equal or smaller size along with him,
    provided they are within 10 meters of him.

-   ***<a id="orgdfee846"></a>:*** Any psionic with at least Telekinesis-1 can use
    this psitech to boost their Mech's Speed rating by 2 and gain +2 to
    all initiative rolls.

-   ***<a id="org67fde36"></a>:*** This psitech functions for any psionic,
    and allows them to automatically detect the presence of sentient
    minds within two kilometers, with a margin of error of roughly 50
    meters for any given mind. The species of sentient can be
    recognized, but not individuals.

-   ***<a id="orgdacbd26"></a>:*** A counterpsi tech, this fitting allows
    a psion with at least Metapsionics-1 to automatically negate any
    psi-based mech fitting targeted at it or any visible ally within 400
    meters. The mech also gains 5 additional points of Armor against psi
    weapons.

-   ***<a id="orgfc13279"></a>:*** A psionic pilot can force a visible target to reroll a
    successful hit roll or skill check. This ability can be used once
    per round, and a maximum number of times per hour equal to the
    pilot's Precognition skill level times two.

-   ***<a id="org3e5be08"></a>:*** A swarm of tiny aerostat sensors surrounds the
    mech out to 200 meters, giving them a constant awareness of their
    surroundings within that range. The sensors provide both audio and
    visual data, and only atmosphere-tight seals can keep them
    out. Their presence will trigger most advanced security alarms,
    however.

-   ***<a id="org2b006ac"></a>:*** These sensors use an array of emissions to
    form a crude model of the terrain 100 meters in front of the mech,
    providing rough detail down to objects one-third of a meter in
    size. It cannot penetrate EM-hardened barriers, but does not
    normally trigger security alerts.

-   ***<a id="org4e85366"></a>:*** The pulse transceiver effectively functions
    as a faster-than-light communications laser with a range sufficient
    to reach the outer rim of a solar system. Provided the mech knows
    the location of a receiver, two-way communication can be
    conducted. The data channel is limited to text and still
    images. Commercial commsats can also serve as receivers if a
    military unit is not available.

-   ***<a id="orgabf5522"></a>:*** These small aerostat drones are one-third of a
    meter in length, with a range of up to ten kilometers. They can
    loiter above a site for up to eight hours before losing power, and
    can be recharged with an hour in the mech's rack. The drones have
    standard and infrared telescopic video sensors and can hover at
    altitudes of up to one thousand meters. While difficult to spot with
    the naked eye, skywatch drones are very easy for modern anti-air
    defenses to locate, and rarely last more than ten or twenty seconds
    over a military target before being brought down. Any damage will
    bring down a drone, but hitting one at maximum altitude with a hand
    weapon requires a hit on armor class 25.

-   ***<a id="orgff2df38"></a>:*** This psitech augmentation is designed to key
    onto recognized allies on the battlefield. When a mech equipped with
    a field is piloted by a psychic with at least Biopsionics-1, it
    automatically stabilizes mortally wounded allies within 100 meters,
    with no action required by the pilot.

-   ***<a id="org1074f3d"></a>:*** These microscale grav plates allow a mech to fly
    at its normal base Speed. This flight functions only in zero-gee or
    microgravity environments, but can eliminate falling damage in
    standard gravity, even for orbital insertions.


<a id="mech-defenses"></a>

### Mech Defenses

-   ***<a id="orgc56c4ae"></a>:*** The quantum taps on this mech have been
    tuned to interfere with the targeting of enemy weapon systems, at
    the cost of additional power drawn from the motive servos. The mech
    has an effective +2 armor class bonus against attacks from other
    vehicles or mechs, though its Speed rating is reduced by 1.

-   ***<a id="org58ed18f"></a>:*** A relative of the same
    hardened plating used on military warships, this plating reduces the
    armor piercing quality of attacking weapons by 5. Thus, a heavy
    laser that normally ignores 25 points of its target's armor now only
    ignores 20.

-   ***<a id="orgf5bfb71"></a>:*** Complex psitech-derived shielding circuitry
    provides limited protection against psi-based weapons, adding 10
    points of Armor that only count against weaponry with the Psi
    quality. This armor stacks with any gained from a *Neural Static
    Generator*.

-   ***<a id="orge32adf1"></a>:*** Holoprojectors and pulsed ECM
    conspire to make it much more difficult to fix the mech in a
    weapon's sights. The effective range of any weapon targeted at the
    mech is reduced by half. This benefit is lost if the attacker is
    within 50 meters of the mech.

-   ***<a id="orgc50c62b"></a>:*** Substantial power and mass is devoted
    to a complex array of redundant systems, increasing the amount of
    punishment the heavy mech can take before it is finally destroyed.

-   ***<a id="orgf666a4f"></a>:*** Blast vent channels, localized force fields,
    and advanced damage control monitors are used to defang
    armor-piercing weaponry used against the heavy mech. The
    armor-piercing quality of an attacking weapon is reduced by 15. This
    defense does not stack with a *Hardened Polyceramic Overlay*.

### Mech Weaponry

Mech weaponry normally requires Shoot skill to fire and relies on the
user's Intelligence or Dexterity to determine hit and damage
modifiers. Most NPC pilots have a total attack bonus of +3 and damage
bonus of +1. Veteran pilots average +5 to hit and +2 damage, while the
grizzled elite rarely have less than +7 to hit and +2 damage.

Some weapons can be fired to suppress. Every target in front of the
weapon that is not under hard cover is automatically hit for half
normal damage, rounded down. A successful Evasion saving throw by the
targets eliminates this damage.


<a id="special-weapon-qualities"></a>

### Special Weapon Qualities

-   ***<a id="orgb5a1599"></a>:*** This weapon uses physical ammunition. After the end of
    every fight in which it was fired, the pilot needs to make a Shoot
    skill check modified by Wisdom against a difficulty of 6. On a
    failure, ammo for the gun has run out until the next maintenance
    cycle is complete. The check difficulty increases by 1 after every
    fight until maintenance.

-   ***<a id="org8c5cdf2"></a>:*** Armored vehicles, fortifications, and light and
    heavy mechs are immune to these light weapons.

-   ***<a id="org1106ac6"></a>:*** The weapon ignores this many points of a target's armor. The
    *Hardened Polyceramic Overlay* or *Vanguard Plating* defense
    upgrades may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a
    weapon's AP rating can do is reduce a target's effective armor to
    zero. It cannot add additional damage to a hit.

-   ***<a id="org85f2eac"></a>:*** The weapon fires in a conical pattern that many meters
    long and wide at its end. All targets within the cone must make an
    Evasion saving throw or be hit, with no hit roll required. Targets
    behind hard cover save automatically.

-   ***<a id="org72db05c"></a>:*** Melee weapons can only be used in handto-hand combat, and
    no non-melee weapon can be used that same round. Pilots use either
    Punch or Stab for hit rolls. Mech melee weapons do not inflict Shock
    damage.

-   ***<a id="orgc9db810"></a>:*** Psi weapons use metadimensional energy channels to
    completely ignore a target's Armor rating, except for any armor
    granted by the *MES Shunt Channel* defense fitting. Defenses such as
    *Hardened Polyceramic Overlay* have no effect on psi
    weaponry. Pilots may optionally choose to use an appropriate psychic
    skill with psi weapons, even melee varieties. Psi weapons rely on
    Wisdom or Constitution to modify attack and damage rolls, rather
    than Dexterity or Intelligence.

-   ***<a id="org5714af7"></a>:*** After firing, the attacker must roll an Int/ Shoot skill
    check against difficulty 8. For psi weapons, use Int and an
    applicable psychic skill. On a failure, the gun must cool down for
    one round before it can be fired again.


<a id="mech-weapon-list"></a>

### Mech Weapon List

-   ***<a id="org1c43cdd"></a>:*** A focalized sonic blast stuns and disorients all
    organic life in the path of this weapon. Damage done by a banshee
    vox is nonlethal, and targets brought to 0 hit points by it will
    wake up 1d4 hours later with 1 hit point. Targets inside a vehicle
    or behind hard cover are immune.

-   ***<a id="orga145e2e"></a>:*** More power-hungry and harder to mount than a heavy
    laser, the beam lance is meant to cut through heavy armor on enemy
    shock mechs.

-   ***<a id="orgeb15e1c"></a>:*** Rotating blades, force-field shearing planes, or
    just a really big axe; cutter plates are meant for melee combat and
    carving large holes through obstacles. Suit cutter plates do 1d12
    damage, light mech ones do 2d12, and heavy mech plates do 3d12.

-   ***<a id="orgc7b5053"></a>:*** A psitech weapon that can be mounted only on
    psimechs and used by a psionically-active pilot, the Finger of God
    is a brutal weapon that operates soundlessly and without visible
    emissions. The psychic piloting the mech selects the target and
    channels a massive surge of metadimensional energy through it. The
    blast ignores all conventional armor and can be expected to suddenly
    reduce anything smaller than a heavy mech into a smoking heap of
    scrap.

</table>

-   \# weapon can fire to suppress

-   ***<a id="org81cf151"></a>:*** A standard choice for anti-personnel
    weaponry, though its TL3 tech makes it useless against mech
    Armor. Upgraded TL4 equivalents cost twice as much.

-   ***<a id="org89aece0"></a>:*** A standard gunnery weapon mounted on a mech, fired
    in volleys as normal for the weapon.

-   ***<a id="org7c39ca3"></a>:*** This object is something large and heavy that
    the mech has snatched up to use as a weapon. Suits do 1d8, light
    mech do 2d8, and heavy do 3d8.

-   ***<a id="org26ae3ed"></a>:*** A spray of superheated plasma turns
    everything within thirty meters of the projector's aperture into
    charcoal and casualty reports.

-   ***<a id="org16488c4"></a>:*** This standard light laser has been retuned to
    optimize it for firing at airborne targets, and the range has been
    greatly increased. It can pick off spy units such as *Skywatch
    Drones* automatically once they have been spotted. The laser is
    optimized for firing at “clean” airborne targets, however, and
    suffers a -4 penalty to hit when aiming for ground-bound targets.

-   ***<a id="org5ec1362"></a>:*** A standard gunnery weapon recalibrated for
    mech use. When it hits a target with Armor, it can reroll any “1”s
    on the damage dice. ***<a id="orgf69093f"></a>:*** A mainstay of heavy shock
    mechs.

-   ***<a id="org71a4c93"></a>:*** The light laser trades the enormous penetrating
    power of its heavier cousin for a lighter power drain and easier
    fitting requirements.

-   ***<a id="orgac7c5b1"></a>:*** This psitech weapon focuses a beam of aligned
    metadimensional energy into a melee weapon that ignores Armor
    ratings. Suits do 1d12 damage with the knife, light mechs do 2d12,
    and heavies do 3d12.

-   ***<a id="org819f768"></a>:*** Named for the horrific hallucinations provoked in
    the few targets to survive a glancing brush from the weapon, the
    mindburner ruthlessly boosts the electrical activity in its targets,
    burning out human minds and electronic devices with equal
    efficiency. Conventional Armor is ignored by the weapon.

-   ***<a id="orgf39de1f"></a>:*** While the range of this energy weapon is shorter
    than that of a light laser, it brings slightly more damage to the
    battlefield.

-   ***<a id="org1952271"></a>:*** The queen of the battlefield, the rail cannon is a
    weapon so heavy it can only be mounted on a heavy shock mech. A
    single rod from a rail cannon can punch through the best vanguard
    defensive plating as if it were tissue. The weapon is prone to
    overheating, however, and makes cruel demands on a mech's power
    grid.

-   ***<a id="org0db1e61"></a>:*** A standard gunnery weapon fitted for mech use. Some
    pilots prefer it over the heavy laser for the sake of the
    suppressive fire it can lay down its good armor-piercing profile,
    albeit at the cost of having to deal with ammo depletion at times.

-   ***<a id="orgf294277"></a>:*** Designed to counter infantry swarms, the razor
    cloud pulses fractal shrapnel in a cloud of steel around the
    mech. Any target within 30 meters is automatically hit, and may make
    an Evasion save for half damage. Any target within 60 meters is
    automatically hit for half damage, and may make an Evasion save to
    take none. Hard cover protects a subject from the cloud.

-   ***<a id="orgc551bf2"></a>:*** A standard Heavy weapon, popular with suit
    pilots who need more range than a heavy machine gun can
    provide. Rocket launchers also have difficulty in locking on targets
    of human size or smaller, applying a -4 to any hit rolls against
    them. Conventional rocket warheads are shaped for maximum armor
    penetration rather than explosive radius, and mech pilots can use
    them even against very close targets without blast danger. Upgraded
    TL4 equivalents cost twice as much.

-   ***<a id="org3f48a6f"></a>:*** While commonly mounted on grav tanks, a vortex
    can also be fitted to a mech.

-   ***<a id="org9bb23a6"></a>:*** A standard anti-personnel weapon refitted for
    mech use. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything
    blast of shrapnel on any side of the mech. All creatures within 10
    meters must make an Evasion save for half damage. Those within 20
    meters take half damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none
    at all.


<a id="achilles-shock-suit"></a>

### Achilles Shock Suit

Power: 10/2 free
Mass: 5/0 free
Cost: 178,000
Armor: 12 against non-Heavy
Speed: 4
Hit Points: 15
AC: 18

Weaponry:

-   TL4 Rocket Launcher (3d10, AP 5, Ammo),
-   Cutter Plates (1d12, AP 10, Melee)

Defenses:

-   None

Fittings:

-   None

A cheap baseline shock suit, the Achilles relies on its pilot's skills
to make up for the lack of elaborate hardware. The rocket launcher
gives the Achilles teeth against enemy armored vehicles or aircraft,
while the cutter plates can chew through a ferrocrete wall before
rapidly shredding any defenders on the other side. Shock-grade armor
plating helps ensure that the Achilles can survive as a doorkicker for
a strike team. Still, the loadout mix forces an Achilles pilot to be
extremely versatile in weapon handling skills for best results.


<a id="ulysses-specialist-suit"></a>

### Ulysses Specialist Suit

Power: 5/0 free
Mass: 10/3 free
Cost: 266,000
Armor: 8 against non-Heavy
Speed: 6
Hit Points: 10
AC: 17

Weaponry:

-   None

Defenses:

-   None

Fittings:

-   Cargo Space (100 kilos)
-   Field Medical Unit
-   Polyspectral Sensors
-   Antigrav Nodes

The Ulysses sacrifices all onboard weapons, leaving the pilot to
defend himself with personal small arms in favor of packing
significant support hardware into the suit's armored
shell. Polyspectral sensors make the suit an excellent scout and
command unit, while the field medical unit aids in recovering downed
allies. The antigrav nodes even allow this suit to fly for extended
periods, and a Ulysses can lift up to two of its allies with it as it
vaults ground obstacles.


<a id="hecate-psi-suit"></a>

### Hecate Psi Suit

Cost: 400,000
Armor: 8 against non-Heavy
Speed: 4
Hit Points: 15
AC: 20

Weaponry:

-   MES Knife (1d12, Psi, Melee)

Defenses:

-   None

Fittings:

-   None

Eldritch engines that were rare even in their heyday, the Hecate was
designed as a basic platform for a mech-trained combat psychic. Its
large amount of unassigned power and mass allowed the psychic to fit
the particular support hardware that best complemented his or her
talents, while the integral MES knife was a backup weapon in case of
sudden confrontation. Most Hecate pilots were expected to remain well
behind the front line. Their talents were rare and valuable enough to
risk only in the best causes, and much of the suit's engineering
margin was devoted to advanced ECM and damage control systems.


<a id="angurvadal-light-shock-mech"></a>

### Angurvadal Light Shock Mech

Power: 20/4 free
Mass: 10/0 free
Cost: 760,000
Armor: 15
Speed: 3
Hit Points: 40
AC: 16

Weaponry:

-   Railgun (3d8#, AP 15, Ammo),
-   TL4 Heavy Machine Gun (3d6#, AP 5, Ammo)

Defenses:

-   Hardened Polyceramic Overlay (-5 to enemy AP qualities)

Fittings:

-   Ammunition Cells x2

A walking bullet fountain, the Angurvadal is meant to provide
long-range fire support against enemy armor, or to take the brunt of
an advance as needed. Extended ammunition magazines keep it firing
after multiple engagements.


<a id="curtana-light-specialist-mech"></a>

### Curtana Light Specialist Mech

Power: 10/0 free
Mass: 20/3 free
Cost: 1,003,000
Armor: 10
Speed: 5
Hit Points: 30
AC: 15

Weaponry:

-   TL4 Rocket Launcher (3d10, AP 5, Ammo)

Defenses:

-   None

Fittings:

-   Field Medical Unit
-   Panoptic Cloud
-   Skywatch Drones
-   Pulse Transceiver

The Curtana is favored by commanders and recon units. Its remarkably
powerful sensor and surveillance fittings can give its pilot a
near-supernatural understanding of the battlefield, in addition to its
ability to communicate with HQ.


<a id="durandal-light-psimech"></a>

### Durandal Light Psimech

Power: 10/4 free
Mass: 10/2 free
Cost: 1,605,000
Armor:10
Speed: 3
Hit Points: 40
AC: 17

Weaponry:

-   Mindburner (4d10, Cone 20m, Psi)

Defenses:

-   Hardened Polyceramic Overlay (-5 to enemy AP qualities)

Fittings:

-   Escape Pod
-   Neural Activity Sensors

Much like its smaller psi suit brethren, the Durandal is designed with
substantial unassigned power and mass in order to accept whatever
psitech fittings best suit the skills of its pilot. These additions
can substantially increase the cost of the base hull, which is built
to provide multiple redundant survival measures for a psychic
pilot. Even a Durandal without additional fittings can act as a
near-faultless early warning system for incoming enemy sentients.


<a id="scorn-heavy-shock-mech"></a>

### Scorn Heavy Shock Mech

Power: 40/2 free
Mass: 20/1 free
Cost: 1,586,000
Armor:25
Speed: 2
Hit Points: 70
AC: 15

Weaponry:

-   Rail Cannon (4d12, AP 45, Slow, Ammo)
-   Railgun (3d8#, AP 15, Ammo)

Defenses:

-   None

Fittings:

-   Breaching Tool
-   Integral Maintenance
-   Ammunition Cells x2

When a fortress stands between an army and victory, a Scorn is sent to
correct the situation. Its massive armor plates are immune to all but
specially-fitted gunnery, and its integral weaponry can smash through
almost any substance known to human science. The Scorn is the product
of late Second Wave military science, however, and is built for a
battlefield that will only rarely see an opposing mech force. It is
somewhat less optimized for facing specialized anti-mech units that
are equipped with the right armor-piercing weaponry to take the beast
down.


<a id="odium-heavy-specialist-mech"></a>

### Odium Heavy Specialist Mech

Power: 20/1 free
Mass: 40/1 free
Cost: 2,485,000
Armor: 15
Speed: 4
Hit Points: 50
AC: 14

Weaponry:

-   Heavy Laser (3d12, AP 20)

Defenses:

-   None

Fittings:

-   Construction Array
-   Integral Maintenance
-   Skywatch Drones
-   Polyspectral Sensors
-   Pulse Transceiver

While the Odium provides much the same communications and recon
abilities as the smaller Durandal, it is distinguished by the heavy
mech-killing laser it mounts and the integral construction array that
allows it to serve as a remote maintenance and repair facility for
numerous other mechs. A single Odium can give a sufficient number of
techs the platform they need to keep an entire mech force operational
in the field, or assist in constructing elaborate field structures and
fortifications.


<a id="despite-heavy-psimech"></a>

### Despite Heavy Psimech

Power: 20/8 free
Mass: 20/8 free
Cost: 3,060,000
Armor: 15
Speed: 2
Hit Points: 60
AC: 16

Weaponry:

-   Finger of God (4d12, Psi, Slow)
-   MES Knife (3d12, Psi, Melee)

Defenses:

-   Hardened Polyceramic Overlay (-5 to enemy AP qualities)

Fittings:

-   Neural Activity Sensors

These vanishingly rare mechs were always somewhat experimental, even
in the late days of humanity's golden age. The sheer mass of
sophisticated psitech components requires for their construction was
almost impossible to acquire on the frontier, and the few Despites
that are found in the modern day are almost always attached to Mandate
military research facilities. While substantial mass and power are
left unused to allow for pilot-specific fittings, even an unfitted
Despite possesses enormous firepower. The psitech Finger of God
weaponry can effortlessly bypass enemy armor, and the gigantic MES
blade generated by its melee defense array can carve open a gravtank
with a few solid strokes.
