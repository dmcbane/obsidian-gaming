# Finders Keepers

An impromptu collection of university kids who were outraged at the disappearance of the [Merry Mariner - Free Merchant](Merry%20Mariner%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) and vowed to do something about it. They took up a collection and sent three of their members to [Nawzira - Planet](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md) because one of their members had discovered a message on the Vault Hunters message board on the dark web which possibly indicated that the [Christmas Ship](Merry%20Mariner%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md) had been taken and might be on [Nawzira - Planet](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md).

## Interactions with [PWP](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md)
- None with the exception that [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) pointed them out to [Welcome Center Site](Welcome%20Center%20Site.md) security personnel as he, [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), and [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) were about to be stopped by security.
