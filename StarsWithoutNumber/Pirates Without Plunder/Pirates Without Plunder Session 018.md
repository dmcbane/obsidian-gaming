[Pirates Without Plunder Session 017](Pirates%20Without%20Plunder%20Session%20017.md)

## Summary of Last Session

The session opened with the party split. The vault team—[Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md), [Ryker](Ryker%20Vox%20-%20PC.md), and [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md)—stood at the threshold of the **Exchange Consulate Escrow Vault**, its front entrance **jammed shut** after being struck by a transport. [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Whiat](Whiat%20Dray%20-%20PC.md) held guard positions outside in the transport tunnel.

The plan was simple: [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), and [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) would explore and assess the vault’s contents, while [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) and [Ryker](Ryker%20Vox%20-%20PC.md) returned to the **Welcome Center 3** via the [Personnel Transport System (PTS)](Nawzira%20Personnel%20Transport%20System.md) with [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Whiat](Whiat%20Dray%20-%20PC.md) to secure a ship for offworld transport.

Inside the vault, the group was immediately greeted by a **confused AI**, misidentifying them and attributing affiliations they’d never heard of. The AI shut down unexpectedly, and they moved deeper, only to be halted by a second AI guarding a **dark barrier**. A hand scanner was used to authenticate them, but when it couldn’t find them in the system, it became agitated. The team calmed the AI, and [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) stepped through the dark veil—only to lose contact with each other inside the sensory-depriving space. [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) wandered briefly, then returned unharmed.

Meanwhile, Benny’s team reached Welcome Center 3 and reviewed three ship options in the holding area:

- A tiny mining vessel
- A battered heavy frigate
- A research ship, **_[RV Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_** (which Sal gleefully wanted to rename _Prometheus_, to tempt fate)
    

They signed out the **_[RV Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_** officially—though Benny considered stealing additional cargo. Then, back in the vault...

[Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) resumed exploring and discovered a **cracked wall leaking water** onto a computer core, shorting it out intermittently. Working together, [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md), [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md), and [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) stabilized the damage long enough to **reactivate the AI**. Grateful, the AI granted them access to the vault’s contents—**but only in priority order** to ensure safe extraction.

What followed was a surreal inventory of ancient, valuable, and often bizarre items:

1. A sealed box of **ancient voting records**
2. A **tech-age compad** ([Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) pocketed it)
3. A box of **ancient paper currency**
4. A **calendar-like object** with what may be the current year
5. A **psychic cube**
6. A list of **emergency access codes**
7. A **perfectly preserved corpse** in a stasis bag
8. A **flying drone** ([Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) shot it)
9. An **astral beacon of psychic doom** ([Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) pocketed it)
10. A set of **prosthetic limbs**
11. An **antimatter charge**—clearly marked for arbitration use
12. A **sinister psychic object** that gave [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) an unpleasant feeling
13. A **locked crate full of diamonds** ([Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) grabbed a few)
14. A device storing **56 brainprints** with room for one more
15. A legal document detailing an **illegal hull retrofit**
16. A **prototype gadget** running at 1% battery
17. An **auto-erasing e-reader** detailing a mission ([Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) recorded it)
18. A crate of **antique luxury goods**
19. A **disputed fossil** with multiple ownership claims
20. A **declaration of war** no one cared about
21. A **money printer** for a defunct currency
22. An **extradimensional object** ([Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) took it)
23. A **governor’s memory backup**, valuable due to his living descendants ([Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) took it)
24. **Seven cryo-containers** with unknown plant life
25. A stasis-sealed **bioweapon** ([Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) secured it carefully)
26. An **ancient star map and data table**—booby-trapped; it exploded, but [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) survived
27. A **lifeboat** with unreadable registration—too large to remove
28. The **vault registry index**, allowing targeted selection of items

With the index in hand, the crew began planning what to remove from the vault and how best to transport it offworld.

[Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) piloted the **_[RV Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_** to a surface location within easy teleport range of the escrow vault and executed a smooth landing. Moments later, Nawzira Approach Control hailed the vessel, warning that it had touched down in an unauthorized zone. The controller instructed [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) to either vacate orbit immediately or return to a designated landing area.


## Concepts for this session

- The labs on the ship that they got are filled with cryostasis chambers.  The ship was owned by slavers who will want this ship back.  They had left it on Nawzira because there was a lot of heat after them and that heat will transfer to PWP.
- Maybe hidden weapons that take up half of the labs but make the hardpoints look empty?

### For the Escape Team
Absolutely. Here's a **fleshed-out encounter** for the **Automated Cold Intercept Protocol**, suitable for a party landing their ship outside Nawzira’s approved zones. This scenario can be adjusted for tone—tense but fair, or oppressive and paranoid—depending on your campaign’s mood.

---

## **Encounter: Automated Cold Intercept Protocol**

**Location**: Frozen flats 20 kilometers from the nearest authorized starport, Nawzira.  
**Trigger**: The party's ship has landed without pre-filed clearance or outside approved zones (intentionally or due to malfunction).  
**Tone**: Legalist, impersonal, methodical—like dealing with a machine-state bureaucracy.

---

### **Phase 1: Immediate Sensor Lock**

- Within **2 minutes** of touchdown, the ship’s internal sensors light up: they're being pinged by **low-orbit satellites** and high-frequency comm bursts.
    
- An automated message pings in the standard Trade Band:
    

> “Unauthorized landing detected. You have violated Nawzira Code 9.3-21.  
> You are being evaluated for intercept under Cold Protocol. Do not attempt to lift off.”

- PCs can attempt a **Lead** or **Admin** skill check (Difficulty 8) to understand that "Cold Protocol" is the _least-lethal_ of Nawzira’s inbound response options.
    

---

### **Phase 2: Intercept Response Deployment**

Within 5–10 minutes:

- **Three VTOL drone interceptors** scream in low over the ice, forming a containment triangle around the vessel.
    
- Each drone hovers 5 meters above the ground and projects a **pulsing blue light field**—designed to interfere with vehicle sensors and deter escape.
    
- Drones project a message:
    

> “Remain inside your vessel. Violation of zone containment will result in neural pulse suppression.”

- Any attempts to exit the ship trigger **active non-lethal suppression**:
    
    - **Neural Disruptor Blasts** (treat as 2d4 shock damage within 5m cone, Stun on failed Phys save).
        
    - PCs may attempt a **Program** or **Fix** skill check (Difficulty 10) to detect the drone network's command signal and assess its behavior.
        

---

### **Phase 3: Legal Hold / Negotiation Window**

- At the 15-minute mark, a legal interface is offered:
    
    - A secure bandwidth channel opens to the **Nawziran Bureau of Landfall Affairs**.
        
    - A robotic bureaucrat (think Lexical Drone Mk7) demands the pilot’s registration, manifests, and explanation.
        
- PCs must pass a **Talk** or **Connect** check (Difficulty 9) to de-escalate or buy time.
    
- Bribes are rejected outright—Nawzira's legal system is **incorruptible but procedurally open**.
    

If successful:

- The Bureau issues a **one-time retroactive permit** for a 500-credit fine and mandatory reroute within 6 hours.
    
- Drones power down to passive monitoring.
    

If failed:

- The drones engage a **Containment Lock**:
    
    - The ship’s external systems are subjected to a **disruption pulse** (save vs System Strain; failure locks nav systems for 2 hours).
        
    - A manned Coldguard Response Team is dispatched (arrives in 2–4 hours).
        

---

### **Optional Hooks & Twists**

- **False Positive**: The party learns someone spoofed their transponder to trigger this response. Who’s trying to frame them?
    
- **Hidden Vault Node**: The area they landed in has buried pretech architecture. The drones might not just be for law enforcement…
    
- **Saboteur Onboard**: One of the ship’s crew has a hidden bounty—Cold Protocol is the soft approach before escalation.
    

---

### **NPC Stats for Drones (if combat breaks out)**

**Cold Intercept Drone**  
_AC:_ 16 | _HD:_ 2 | _HP:_ 10 | _Move:_ Fly 30m | _Atk:_ Neural Blast (2d4 shock, cone, Stun on failed save)  
_Special_: Immune to heat, cold, fear, charm. On destruction, broadcasts distress ping unless jammed (Program 10).  
_Behavior_: Non-lethal suppression. Retreats if outnumbered or directly hacked.

---
Great! Here's a continuation of the encounter, including:

1. **A tactical battle map concept**
    
2. **Coldguard team stat blocks**
    
3. **Escalation options for the encounter**
    

---

## **1. Tactical Battle Map Concept: Frozen Intercept Zone**

Imagine the ship landed on a **featureless glacier plain**, pocked with old boreholes and spiny ice ridges. The intercept drones form a perimeter triangle around the ship.

**Map Dimensions**: 30m x 30m grid (each square = 2m)  
**Key Features**:

- **Ship**: 4x6 square block in the center.
    
- **Drone Positions**: 3 drones form a triangle, 10m from ship edges.
    
- **Ice Ridges**: Low cover (+2 AC) at map corners.
    
- **Sensor Flare Nodes**: Two small emitters embedded in the ice, jam electronic countermeasures (can be disabled with Fix 9).
    

You could draw this or use any generic sci-fi tactical grid, placing the ship centrally and the drones at equidistant points around it.

---

## **2. Coldguard Response Team (Stat Blocks)**

If the players escalate, stall, or flee, the Coldguard unit arrives 2–4 hours later in a VTOL dropship, with 4–6 troopers in arctic-rated tactical armor.

---

### **Coldguard Operative** _(Elite Enforcement Trooper)_

- **AC**: 17 (powered cold armor)
    
- **HD**: 2
    
- **HP**: 12
    
- **Attack**:
	    ccccccukcvjgtnetcjnceiulikdgljctlllkrrugvket
	    
    - **Magpulse Rifle**: +4 to hit, 1d8+1, range 100/300
        
    - **Freezing Foam Grenade** (1 per trooper): 5m radius, Dex save or Immobilized for 1 round
        
- **Tactics**: Coordinate suppressive fire, use cover, and demand surrender before killshots.
    
- **Gear**: Cold-Seal Armor (thermal negation, +2 on saves vs cold), comlink uplinks to orbit.
    
- **Skills**: +2 Tactics, +1 Notice, +1 Talk
    
- **Special**: Immune to freezing effects. Deploys **Containment Beacons** (blocks vehicle movement within 10m).
    

---

### **Coldguard Commander** _(Squad Leader / Negotiator)_

- **AC**: 16
    
- **HD**: 3
    
- **HP**: 18
    
- **Attack**:
    
    - **Smartpistol**: +4 to hit, 1d6+2
        
    - **Command Override Module** (1/encounter): Overrides 1 hostile electronic system within 20m (Program vs. Target AC)
        
- **Skills**: +2 Admin, +2 Connect, +1 Leadership
    
- **Tactics**: Offers final negotiation before combat; more interested in capturing than killing.
    

---

## **3. Escalation Options**

These elements allow for branching outcomes:

### **Success via De-escalation**

- PCs surrender or pay the fine, gaining a temporary but **watchlisted clearance**.
    
- They may get a bureaucratic contact useful later ("Clerk Isemva, Bureau of Landfall Adjudication").
    

### **Combat Victory**

- Drones destroyed or Coldguard defeated.
    
- However, this puts **an open warrant** on the crew.
    
- Future Nawziran cities flag them at ports; bounty placed.
    

### **Flight**

- PCs escape before ground team arrives, but ship systems take **System Strain**, and future landings on Nawzira become **illegal by default**.

Would you like a visual map sketch or token layout next? Or a mission seed tied to this landing site (e.g., a buried vault or outlaw hideout nearby)?


### For the Vault Team
Great! Here is the **adjusted encounter** now that the **vault has already been breached**, and the **PCs are attempting to escape with what they can carry**. This version heightens tension, escalates NPC responses, and integrates stat blocks for the relevant NPCs and threats.

---

## 🔧 **Encounter Update: “Tunnel 19 Containment Incident – Escalation Phase”**

### **Scene Context:**

The player characters have **breached the hidden Exchange Escrow Vault**. Inside, they found unregistered escrow cargo: psion-reactive materials, encrypted data drives, and at least one Pretech object they can’t fully identify.

The act **triggered both the WOCT and VIC protocols**, and time is now running out. Escape is the priority—but the tunnels are now **swarming with both automated infrastructure lockdown elements** and a **covert Exchange retrieval team**.

---

## 📍 **Scene Adjustments:**

### **Environmental State:**

- The _barrier mesh_ is now fully extended behind them, making return through the main access tunnel almost impossible without cutting tools or sabotage (Tech skill, DC 10).
    
- _Sensor drones_ have begun tracking life signs and movement; some now carry active stun pulses.
    
- The _vault door_, now ajar, emits a faint harmonic tone—the Pretech lock is destabilizing.
    
- The players may be contaminated with **Exchange nanodust markers**, visible only with the right scan settings.
    

---

## 👥 **Hostile/Neutral NPCs:**

---

### **🔫 Elo Vara – Exchange Retrieval Operative**

- **Class Template:** Expert (Custom)
    
- **Level:** 5
    
- **HP:** 28
    
- **AC:** 17 (Synthmesh + Agility)
    
- **Attack Bonus:** +4
    
- **Saves:** Physical 13, Evasion 10, Mental 10, Luck 14
    
- **Skills:** Notice +2, Sneak +2, Shoot +2, Talk +2, Tech +1
    
- **Gear:**
    
    - Silenced magpistol (1d6+2, Shock 2/AC15)
        
    - Optic shroud field (Advantage on Stealth rolls)
        
    - Exchange identification override badge (can spoof WOCT security)
        
    - Dermal tracer scanner (detects VIC nanodust on PCs)
        

**Tactics:** Elo Vara isn’t here to kill—unless necessary. She will attempt to isolate and recover high-value items. If possible, she offers the PCs a deal (or a threat): return what they stole in exchange for walking away.

---

### **🤖 WOCT Suppression Drone (x2)**

- **HD:** 2
    
- **AC:** 14
    
- **HP:** 10
    
- **Attack:** Stun pulse emitter (Save or be stunned for 1 round, 10-ft cone, no damage)
    
- **Movement:** Flight 20m
    
- **Special:**
    
    - Self-destruct if captured or disabled (1d6 Explosive, 3m radius)
        
    - Emits jamming field (−1 to all Comms/Scan attempts within 10m)
        

**Tactics:** Drones hover above and attempt to stall, confuse, or separate PCs. Their job is to delay escape until retrieval agents arrive.

---

### **🧠 Vault Defense Subsystem (Optional if Vault Contents Are Disturbed Further)**

- **Type:** Psionic Feedback Pulse
    
- **Trigger:** Attempting to open or tamper with sealed containers inside the vault
    
- **Effect:** All Psychics within 20m must Save vs Mental or suffer Confusion (as the Level 1 Telepath spell) for 1d4 rounds. Non-psychics feel nauseous but suffer no mechanical effect.
    

---

## 🎒 **Vault Loot (Sample Selection):**

The PCs may be carrying:

- **1x Sealed Pretech Container** (HEAVY): No visible interface. Emits low-grade radiation. Unknown function.
    
- **3x Exchange Encrypted Data Drives**: Marketable to corporate rivals or governments.
    
- **1x Psi-Inductive Crystal (SMALL)**: Reacts to psychic presence. Worth ~15,000 credits, or far more to the right buyer.
    
- **1x Unregistered Credstick Cluster**: 2d6 x 1,000 credits.
    

Optional: A **stasis-capsule with a dormant biological entity** in it. Unknown origin.

---

## 🚨 **Escape Routes and Obstacles:**

1. **Main Tunnel (Blocked by WOCT Barriers):**
    
    - Needs heavy damage to force open or hack the power junction.
        
    - Drones guard this route actively.
        
2. **Side Maintenance Shaft:**
    
    - Not on public maps.
        
    - Tight squeeze for armored or heavily encumbered PCs.
        
    - Leads toward an industrial airlift shaft. A few drones may patrol it.
        
3. **Old Service Rail Line (Found via successful Notice or Tech roll):**
    
    - Long-abandoned.
        
    - May contain environmental hazards (steam vents, unstable floor, vermin).
        
4. **Talk Your Way Out:**
    
    - If the PCs present a believable cover story or cut a deal with Elo Vara.
        
    - Options: claim to be contracted inspectors, fake ID usage, attempt to bribe or blackmail.
        

---

## 🎲 **Optional Twist:**

- One of the **items they grabbed is actively pinging a translocator beacon**—the vault’s owners _want it to be taken_, so they can follow it to the next buyer.
    

---
That changes the tactical and narrative dynamic **significantly**, and in compelling ways. Here's how to reinterpret the encounter with the fact that:

- The **PCs entered via the hidden door into the foyer** _before_ the collision,
    
- And they possess the ability to **teleport to any location they’ve physically seen** within **10 km**.
    

---

## 🌀 **Impact of Pre-Strike Foyer Entry + Short-Range Teleportation**

### 1. **The Jammed Door = Escape Blockade, Not Entry Obstacle**

Since the **tractor strike happened _after_ they entered**, the hidden **exterior door is now jammed behind them**.

- The PCs can no longer **exit** back into the tunnel the way they came—at least, not without **reopening the exterior vault access door**, which is now damaged and power-locked.
    
- This adds urgency and pressure, especially if the players are burdened by loot, wounded, or split up.
    

**Teleportation Advantage:**  
If they’ve **seen the tunnel-side area outside the foyer**, they can teleport back **outside the jammed door**, bypassing the blocked exit.

---

### 2. **Teleportation = Strategic Escape or Ambush Option**

Because they can teleport to any location they've seen within 10 km:

- They can **teleport past WOCT security barriers**, drones, or ambushes, provided they’ve seen their destination earlier (e.g., a nearby service tunnel, upper-level corridor, rooftop, etc.).
    
- This lets them **split the party**, stage diversions, or escape in unpredictable ways Exchange agents weren’t prepared for.
    

**However:**

- **Exchange nanodust** may still be on them. Wherever they teleport, they may still be _tracked_.
    
- If the PCs carry Pretech or psi-reactive loot, it may interfere with teleportation accuracy (see optional twist below).
    
- **Teleporting into an unknown or partially-mapped location** remains dangerous—unless they've done recon previously.
    

---

### 3. **FOYER as Tactical Anchor Point**

The foyer is now both:

- The **entry route they used**, and
    
- A **possible fallback/extraction anchor** if they want to **teleport back in** from elsewhere (e.g., if they escape and want to return once security dies down).
    

You can treat it as a **narrative “safehouse” node**, assuming they can unlock or pry the damaged door again from the tunnel side in the future.

---

### 4. **Exchange Countermeasures Possibility**

The Exchange, realizing there’s been a breach and that VIC triggered, might deploy:

- **Psi-dampening fields or anchors** in the area to block teleportation in/out.
    
- A **specialist psychic** tracking teleport signatures or laying mental traps near the vault's space.
    
- An **AI-piloted drone** with line-of-sight tracking—if it _saw_ the PCs, it can extrapolate destinations within the 10 km radius for pursuit.
    

---

### 🧠 Optional Complications/Mechanics:

#### **Pretech Loot Interference (Optional Rule)**

Certain vault items might interfere with teleportation.

- PCs carrying a **Pretech containment pod**, **psi-reactive crystal**, or **anomalous stasis capsule** must make a **Mental Save** or risk mis-teleporting.
    
- On failure, they:
    
    - Arrive 1d4 rounds late,
        
    - Drop gear randomly,
        
    - Or land within 100m of target (Referee’s choice)

### 🗺 Escape Route Revision Summary:

| Route                    | Current State                     | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hidden Exterior Door** | **Jammed shut** post-collision    | Reopening possible with effort; still a valid teleport anchor.     |
| **Tunnel Path**          | **WOCT active**, drones, lockdown | Very dangerous unless bypassed via teleport.                       |
| **Foyer (Vault Side)**   | **Still intact**                  | Safe fallback. Used as teleport “bookmark.”                        |
| **Teleportation**        | **Viable to seen locations**      | Tactical edge; may draw Exchange attention or trigger loot issues. |
| **Maintenance Shaft**    | **Accessible, unguarded**         | Physical escape route if teleporting is blocked.                   |
| **Exchange Arrival**     | **Imminent** (Elo Vara + drones)  | Increases pressure to choose escape route fast.                    |

## What actually Happened

- The session started with Nawzira Approach Control giving the **_[RV Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md)_** the option to either leave orbit or return to an approved landing zone.  [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) talked them into giving him 15 minutes to prepare the ship for lift off.  [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) teleported down to the **_Exchange Consulate escrow vault_** to get [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) moving.
- [Sal](Salizar Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) and [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) analyzed the list and identified the items that they were going to carry out of the vault.  They had prioritized the items and took what they could get based on the number of teleports that [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) could perform.
- [Leon](Leon Ardo%20-%20PC.md) teleported [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) and two person sized items back to the [R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) so that both would be able to teleport between ship and vault.  It took only a few trips back and forth to get everything they were going to be able to remove from the vault.
- During the last trip to the vault, [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) set demolition charges on a timer in the foyer between the outer door and the inner door and then shot the glass ceiling that separated the vault from the lake as he teleported the last load out.
- [Elias](Elias Merten%20-%20PC.md) was convinced that he needed to kill [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) but the team convinced him not to (roll of the dice).
- The [R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) left orbit just ahead of approach control's deadline and the team headed for the [Calia system](Calia%20-%20System.md).
- During the 12 days of their transit to [Calia](Calia%20-%20System.md), [the team](Players%20and%20Their%20Characters.md) explored the [R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md):
	- Ryker discovered that the [Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) was commissioned by the Multani Research Group based out of [Melides](Melides%20-%20Planet.md) in the [Monterv system](Monterv%20-%20System.md), but it was never delivered to them.  The contract was taken over by Cross Parsec which is owned by the [Cygnus Arc Cartel](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md).
	- Lab 1 - Astrophysics - lab with complete inventory installed during initial construction.
	- Lab 2 - Geology - lab with complete inventory installed during initial construction.
	- Lab 3 - Genetics - lab with complete inventory installed during initial construction.
	- Lab 4 - type not identified.  Installed at some unspecified date. Drawing a tremendous amount of power.
	- [Elias](Elias Merten%20-%20PC.md) and [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) explored Labs 1-3 and discovered that each have 64 cryostasis pods with minimal connections to the ship (power and video only no control).
	- The warning in Lab 3 was generated by a failed cryostasis pod.  The person, formerly in the pod, escaped successfully and was standing, naked, at the back of the lab.
	- [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) used his diplomat focus to eventually be able to speak to the man from the pod, Idowu Young, a kelp farmer.  His entire village was kidnapped.
	- [Ryker](Ryker Vox%20-%20PC.md) searched the navigation logs to conclude that the 188 occupants of the pods are likely from [Ankanju Ratri](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md) in the [Monterv](Monterv%20-%20System.md) system.
	- Lab 4 was not a lab.  [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) identified the contents of the container as weapons systems components; at least until he can do more research.
	- [Sal](Salizar Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) was able to repair the Spike drive so that it is again able to do Spike 2.  In the process, he discovered that there was a speed 2 upgrade that had been installed incorrectly and he was able to repair that as well.  The [R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) now has Spike-2 and Speed-2 capabilities.
- Based on [Benny's](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) conversations with Idowu and [Ryker's](Ryker%20Vox%20-%20PC.md) reseach into the ship's logs, the team concluded that the [R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) was a slave ship and that the contents of the cryostasis pods are captives who were taken on [Ankanju Ratri](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md).
- After long discussions, our team decided to deliver the captives back to their home world.
- During the transit to [Ankanju Ratri](Ankanju%20Ratri%20-%20Planet.md), [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) figured out that the ship had many, upgrades beyond the Spike-2 and Speed-2 upgrades.
	- The "Lab 4" space actually contains the control systems, power supplies, ammunition, etc. with cables routed to the ship's hard points.
	- The Plasma Beam can be mounted to the hard points directly above the "Lab" in 10-15 minutes.
	- All of the hard points can be mounted within 45-60 minutes.
- List of fixtures:
	- Multifocal Laser x3 power 5x3/mass 1x3/hard points 1x3
	- Reaper Battery power 4/mass 1/hard point 1
	- Plasma Beam power 5/mass 1/hard point 2
	- Auxiliary Power Unit x3 power +5x3/mass 0.5x3
	- Cargo (15 tons)
	- Extended Stores mass 1
	- Fuel Bunkers mass 1
	- Fuel Scoops mass 1
	- Hydroponics Production mass 2
	- Ship’s Locker 
	- Survey Sensor Array power 2/mass 1
	- Workshop power 1/mass 0.5
	- Drive 2 Upgrade
	- Speed 2 Upgrade
	- Power: 30/3 free (when "Lab" cryostasis pods are removed)
	- Mass: 13/2 free (when "Lab" cryostasis pods are removed)
