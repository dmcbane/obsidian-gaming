## BREAKING: Manhunt Intensifies After Shocking Terror Attack on Graff 9

“Holiday Horror in Orbit”

Graff 9 Station Security is coordinating with Nawziran authorities and interstellar enforcement agencies in a massive manhunt after a devastating bombing ripped through the outer docking ring yesterday, destroying the Merry Mariner, the Thora sector’s famed Christmas Ship.
  
Authorities confirmed that the explosion, which claimed the lives of all crew members of the Merry Mariner and at least 14 dock personnel, was deliberate.

Just moments before the blast, an unknown voice hijacked all open comm channels across the station, claiming responsibility for stealing the _Merry Mariner_ to prevent continued exploitation and criticizing its return. Investigators are treating the message as a terrorist claim of responsibility, possibly linked to anti-commercial or anti-Council extremist factions active in the fringe sectors.

Surveillance footage obtained from the popular Gravity Well cantina—located just down from the blast zone—shows two individuals identified as crew members of the Merry Mariner present in the lounge just minutes before the explosion. They were seen speaking with several unidentified persons docked on a neighboring vessel. That ship, reportedly damaged in the blast but able to break free before full decompression, has since left the station and is believed by security personnel to be en route to the frozen planet of Nawzira.

“We’re looking at a coordinated internal detonation, not an external strike,” said Inspector Lira Montero, newly appointed head of Graff 9 Station Security. “This was planned. And someone helped them get off this station.”

Anonymous sources within the Nawziran planetary information network suggest that planetary defense satellites have been repositioned to monitor atmospheric re-entry corridors. It is also believed that a strict no-landing directive has been put in place at all normal entry locations unless cleared through Nawzira Central Control.

GalacticNet is offering a 50,000 credit reward for verified leads leading to the apprehension of the suspects. Anyone with information is urged to report via secure NetChannel 8A or contact local Enforcement Liaison.
