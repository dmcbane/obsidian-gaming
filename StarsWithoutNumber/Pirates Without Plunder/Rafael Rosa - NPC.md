### **Rafael Rosa**

_Heir to the Throne of Planet Dior_  
_Titles: Crown Prince of Dior, Commander of the Skyborne Guard (Ceremonial)_

**Background:**  
Born into privilege but not complacency, Rafael Rosa was groomed from birth to be Dior's next monarch. His mother (the sister of Lucia Augusto) died under mysterious circumstances when he was young, deepening his bond with Lucia, who stepped in as both surrogate mother and political tutor.

At just twenty-four years old, Rafael has already become a popular figure among the people of Dior. He projects hope, reform, and energy—exactly the image the Regency needs during turbulent times. But behind his dazzling public persona, Rafael feels increasingly boxed in by political expectations, secret enemies, and the legacy he is expected to uphold without fully understanding the forces moving beneath the surface.

He suspects there are darker games being played around him (and by Lucia herself), but so far, he has chosen to focus on his public duties, pretending not to see what he cannot yet fight.

**Personality:**

- Charismatic, idealistic, intelligent—but not naive.
    
- Deeply loyal to Dior but quietly resents being "managed" by his elders.
    
- Struggles between wanting to trust the people around him and recognizing that trust is dangerous.
    
- Flashes of temper and impatience surface when he feels patronized or cornered.
    
- Privately ambitious to reshape Dior into a freer and more just society, but realizes that the system may not survive such changes.

**Skills and Abilities:**

- **Public Speaking:** Rafael can stir a crowd or calm a diplomatic room like few others.
    
- **Swordsmanship and Aerial Combat:** He is an excellent ceremonial duelist and trained flyer—skills emphasized more for public display than practical use.
    
- **Tactical Thinking:** Better at open leadership and battlefield planning than secret plots—an area where he depends (dangerously) on others.
    
- **Cultural Fluency:** Understands Dior’s history and customs intuitively, and can bridge generational divides within the planet’s factions.

**Appearance:**

- Late 20s, athletic, with striking golden-brown skin and sharply angular features.
    
- Wears regal uniforms adapted to look more practical and youthful than traditional royal garb.
    
- His signature piece is a thin silver circlet worn across his forehead—a symbol of heirship on Dior.

**Relationship to Lucia Augusto:**

- Affectionate but wary; sees her as a protector and mentor but also an enigma.
    
- Respects her wisdom but increasingly questions her methods.
