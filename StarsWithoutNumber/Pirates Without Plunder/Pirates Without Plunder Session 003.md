## Goals

-   Primary - profitable first month
-   Secondary - survive first encounter with drug cartel - get info on drug
-   Revisit the primary goal since the maintenance fee is 6 months not 1 month

## Concepts for approaches to jobs discussed while in transit

-   Distress signal - jammer - wait - salvage job! (Eric\'s idea)
-   **concept of using the job boards to find prizes for pirating jobs**. (LJs\' idea)

## Crew berthing

-   Captain's - [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)
-   Top Left - [Michael Jones - PC](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md)
-   Top Right - [Long John Silver - NPC](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md)
-   Bottom Left - [Ev'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md)
-   Bottom Right - [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md)

## Combat Department Assignments

-   Captain - [Eric Magnus - PC](Eric%20Magnus%20-%20PC.md)
-   Comms - [Long John Silver - NPC](Long%20John%20Silver%20-%20NPC.md)
-   Bridge - [Michael Jones - PC](Michael%20Jones%20-%20PC.md)
-   Engineering - [Ev'ee Lucian](Ev_ee%20Lucian%20-%20PC.md)
-   Gunnery - [Elias Merten - PC](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md)

## [Elim Project - Gas Giant Mine](Elim%20Project%20-%20Gas%20Giant%20Mine.md) - near [Gunn - Planet](Gunn%20-%20Planet.md) in [LS 780 - Black Hole](LS%20780%20-%20Black%20Hole.md)

-   Project Manager - [Muhtar Aino - NPC](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md)
-   First Mate - [Miko Suyates - NPC](Miko%20Suyates%20-%20NPC.md)
-   Received 80K for the junk used equipment because [Miko](Miko%20Suyates%20-%20NPC.md) screwed up the contract and it didn\'t mention that it must be new equipment anywhere in the contract. [Muhtar](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md) is an honorable man so he honored the contract.
-   [Muhtar](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md) is in a bind because he has an exceptional opportunity but can\'t capitalize without new equipment. He offered to give the [PWP](PWP.md) 160K cr to go back to [Surita Kawah - Planet](Surita%20Kawah%20-%20Planet.md) and pick up new equipment from [Lionstar Productions (LP)](Lionstar%20Productions.md) and bring it back within a month. He would front the team 80K cr to purchase the equipment and would pay the remaining 80K cr upon delivery.
-  [Hydra Boroka](Hydra%20Boroka.md) is the muscle that will go with the team to protect [Muhtar Aino - NPC](Muhtar%20Aino%20-%20NPC.md)\'s investment until the equipment is delivery.

## Unknown transport job - meeting on [Keeler 2 - Refueling Station](Keeler%202%20-%20Refueling%20Station.md) - [LS 780 - Black Hole](LS%20780%20-%20Black%20Hole.md)

-   [Reannon Quixote - NPC](Reannon%20Quixote%20-%20NPC.md) (not her real name) meets the team at [Keeler 2 - Refueling Station](Keeler%202%20-%20Refueling%20Station.md) while they refuel.
-   They are to deliver a cryo chamber to Eumedes in the [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) without ever opening the chamber or allowing anyone to board the ship and discover the chamber.
-   Upon entering the [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md), they will receive a coded message that tells them where to go near [Eumedes - Planet](Eumedes%20-%20Planet.md). Upon successful delivery of the chamber, they will receive 500K cr.

### The real scoop

-  [Reannon Quixote - NPC](Reannon%20Quixote%20-%20NPC.md) is actually [Lucia Augusto - NPC](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md), aunt of [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md), heir to the throne of the [Dior - Planet](Dior%20-%20Planet.md) in the [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md).
-  [Mateus Augusto - NPC](Mateus%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) is brother of [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md)'s father and has been guardian of the empire until [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md) comes of age. [Lucia Augusto - NPC](Lucia%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) discovered that [Mateus Augusto - NPC](Mateus%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) plans to dispose of [Rafael Rosa - NPC](Rafael%20Rosa%20-%20NPC.md) so that he can continue to rule the empire.
-   [Mateus Augusto - NPC](Mateus%20Augusto%20-%20NPC.md) hired [Balder Mad Eye Bucker - NPC](Balder%20Mad%20Eye%20Bucker%20-%20NPC.md), pirate for hire, to intercept the cryo chamber before it can be delivered. [Balder Mad Eye Bucker - NPC](Balder%20Mad%20Eye%20Bucker%20-%20NPC.md) is the captain of the [Dark Avenger - Corvette](Dark%20Avenger%20-%20Corvette.md).
-   [Balder Mad Eye Bucker - NPC](Balder%20Mad%20Eye%20Bucker%20-%20NPC.md) and crew were to intercept the [Cambrian - Free Merchant](Cambrian%20-%20Free%20Merchant.md), board her, and retrieve the cryo chamber prior to departure from [LS 780 - Black Hole](LS%20780%20-%20Black%20Hole.md).
-   Since that didn\'t happen, the military presence in [Calia - System](Calia%20-%20System.md) will intercept both ships, and we\'ll see where it goes from there...
