## Unwitting Cartel Connections

The Multani Research Group has become inadvertently connected to Cygnus Arc Cartel operations through several vectors:

### Supply Chain Infiltration
- **Shipping Contracts:** Cartel front companies have secured legitimate shipping agreements

### Infrastructure Exploitation
- **Abandoned Platforms:** Mothballed facilities provide cover for Cartel operations
- **Navigation Data:** Shipping routes used by Cartel vessels for legitimate cover
- **Communication Arrays:** Research equipment repurposed for Cartel intelligence gathering

### Financial Entanglements
- **Investment Partnerships:** Cartel money laundered through legitimate investment funds
- **Insurance Policies:** Cartel companies provide "competitive" coverage for risky operations
- **Credit Extensions:** Favorable financing terms that create dependency relationships
