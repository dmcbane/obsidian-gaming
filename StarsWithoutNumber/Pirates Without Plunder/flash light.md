# Flashlight

A very sophisticated light source that gets a trickle-charge from the kinetic energy fluctuations caused by normal motion.  They may present as small cylindrical objects easily carried on your person, they may present as flat circular objects that are easily attached to other objects.

They normally have a range of roughly 10 meters and can illuminate a circular area of about 3 meters diameter at a distance of 5 meters to 300 lux (standard office light level).  At this setting, the device can provide illumination indefinitely as long as the device is in motion or for 12 hours if stationary.

The high intensity setting can be used to extend the range, the diameter of the illuminated area, or the intensity of the illumination to double normal for 6 hours if in motion or 3 hours if stationary.  Two areas of increase (i.e. range and area, range and intensity, or area and intensity) can be sustained for 1.5 hours if in motion or 1/2 an hour if stationary.  Increasing all three can be sustained for 1/2 if in motion and 5 minutes if stationary.
