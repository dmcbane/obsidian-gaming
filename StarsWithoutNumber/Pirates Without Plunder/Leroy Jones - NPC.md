# Leroy Jones - NPC

An alias for someone who met with [Nico Santero - NPC](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) at the [Welcome Center Site](Welcome%20Center%20Site.md).

This person was meeting with [Nico Santero - NPC](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) because he had figured out the location of what [Nico Santero - NPC](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) thought was a PreTech Vault on [Nawzira - Planet](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md).  They told [Nico Santero - NPC](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) that he was wrong, that it was an Exchange Consolate Vault just before he stabbed him and left him to die.
