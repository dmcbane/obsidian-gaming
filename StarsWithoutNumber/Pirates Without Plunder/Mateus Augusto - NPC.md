### **Mateus Augusto**

_Regent of Planet Dior_  
_Titles: Lord Regent, Protector of the Crown_

**Background:**  
A former admiral and decorated war hero, Mateus Augusto was never meant to rule. Yet after the unexpected deaths of the king and queen, the Crown Council elevated him to Regent until Rafael Rosa reaches full ascension age.

Mateus is a pragmatic and seasoned leader. He balances the competing interests of noble houses, corporate factions, and planetary guilds while maintaining a careful façade of unity. Though publicly deferential to Rafael as the future king, Mateus knows that _real_ governance must be handled with steadier, older hands until Rafael is ready—or perhaps indefinitely, if Rafael proves too idealistic for Dior's brutal realities.

Privately, Mateus believes Dior's survival depends not on tradition, but on _control._

---

**Personality:**

- Calm, disciplined, deeply calculating.
    
- Wields charm and intimidation with equal precision.
    
- Cares for Rafael but sees him more as a symbol than a fully autonomous leader (yet).
    
- Trusts Lucia implicitly—they are true partners, both personally and politically.
    

---

**Skills and Abilities:**

- **Military Strategy:** His experience during the War of the Shattered Belts made him a master of logistics, siegecraft, and large-scale fleet maneuvering.
    
- **Diplomacy:** A veteran of dozens of high-stakes negotiations and crisis summits.
    
- **Deception:** Understands that smiling while lying is often the mark of true leadership.
    

---

**Appearance:**

- Early 60s, rugged and still physically formidable despite the weight of age.
    
- Salt-and-pepper hair, neatly trimmed beard, hawk-like gaze.
    
- Dresses in traditional Regent’s robes, muted in color but rich in symbolism.

**Relationship to Lucia Augusto:**

- A marriage of true political partnership and deep mutual respect.
    
- They are a _team_—Lucia working the invisible levers of power, Mateus holding the visible reins.
    

**Relationship to Rafael Rosa:**

- Fatherly but managing; admires Rafael’s spirit but worries he is too sentimental to survive.
