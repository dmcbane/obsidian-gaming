## Summary of Last Session

The session began with Kartik Chandan (known to the crew as Long John Silver) revealing he was actually a covert agent summoned back to Dior after the suspected assassination of Regent Mateus Augusto. Lucia Augusto, his widow and protector of the heir, recalled Kartik to help safeguard Rafael. Until now, the crew had no idea LJS was a spy, originally assigned to them during an early mission transporting the heir in cryostasis.

Captain Elias considered rebadging the Cambrian, but decided against it. The ship was left with Sal and Benny's family on Papadoudou, and the crew booked commercial passage to Nawzira.

After a slow, security-heavy journey, they arrived and posed as tourists. They secured cold-weather gear, visitor badges, and were briefed on restricted areas. Acting on a local recommendation, they visited Nawzira’s only unfrozen lake, where they independently encountered Nico Santero and Leroy Jones. The three groups agreed to join forces in finding and opening the vault.

Survey data revealed a submerged sphere beneath the lake, suggesting a hidden entrance. The crew found it, activated the system, and struggled to gain entry until the vault’s AI finished booting. Though Elias followed the protocols, he failed the original security tests. He convinced the AI that no one could meet the old requirements anymore. After some agitation, the AI justified opening the vault.

The session ended as Elias shot and killed Leroy Jones on the threshold of the vault.

## What  actually happened

### Unknown to the PCs
* Initial AI Reaction - Genuinely Helpful
* The distance from the vault to the landing zone at the [Welcome Center Site](Welcome%20Center%20Site.md) on [Nawzira](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md) is:
	* [Nawzira](Nawzira%20-%20Planet.md)’s mean radius is about **3,389 km**. 
	* The circumference of a sphere is C=2πR, so one-third of that is:  1/3 C  =  2πR/3  ≈  2π×3,389  km3  ≈  7,100  km
	* **7,100 kilometres**, or **≈ 4,400 miles**, measured along a great-circle path (e.g., around the equator).
* The underground lake is 1.65 kilometers underground and the Exchange Consulate escrow value is 1.75 kilometers underground.
* The repair ticket related to the door that the transport hit in the tunnel is the 351st entry in the queue for maintenance.  Fortunately for PWP, the criteria required it to be rated as low priority, but Work Order Containment Tag (WOCT) Protocol will be triggered as soon as it moves through the queue (within the hour).
* There are 3 ships in the holding area of the Tertiary Welcome Center:
	- First was [](Civilian%20Starships.md#Alberich-Class%20Mining%20Ship) which was too small for what they needed.
	- Second was [](Civilian%20Starships.md#Blackbeard-Class%20Commerce%20Raider|Blackbeard-Class%20Commerce%20Raider) whose armor plating was very beat up.
	- Third was the [R.V. Aurora Parallax](R.V.%20Aurora%20Parallax%20-%20Research%20Ship.md) is a [](Civilian%20Starships.md#Hawking-Class%20Research%20Ship|Hawking-class%20research%20ship) which they chose
		* Previous owner [Cygnus Arc Cartel](Cygnus%20Arc%20Cartel%20-%20Faction.md)
		* Dropped off by [Sela "Slate" Morvane](Sela%20'Slate'%20Morvane%20-%20NPC.md)

* The crates that Benny discovered in the holding area contains: (Someone else signed for them before PWP could get them.)
	- Construction materials (bricks, tiles, etc.)
	- Rubber
	- Lard

* The following were names were former vault customers who the AI confused our PCs with during the vault lottery
	- Nazir Muraviov (Arabic Russian)
	- Rei Vasiliadis (Japanese Greek)


### PCs are aware of:
-  Review of situation:
	- The door from the transport tunnel into the foyer of the Exchange Consulate escrow vault (the one that the transport tractor hit at full speed) is jammed closed.
	- [Benny](Benito%20Benny%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) (Jimmy's character) and [Whiat](Whiat%20Dray%20-%20PC.md) (Ethan's character) are in the transport tunnel standing guard.
	- [Elias](Elias%20Merten%20-%20PC.md) (David's character), [Sal](Salizar%20Sal%20Maroni%20-%20PC.md) (Daniel's character), [Leon](Leon%20Ardo%20-%20PC.md) (Mary's character),  [Ryker](Ryker%20Vox%20-%20PC.md) (Mike's character) and [Nico](Nico%20Santero%20-%20NPC.md) (NPC) are inside at the threshold of the vault.  
- The team planned for Sal, Elias, and Nico to stay in the vault and attempt to identify content that might be useful or valuable to us, while Leon and Ryker teleports back to Benny and Whiat and then go to the holding area to acquire a ship to transport the haul off world.
- Nico revealed that he has a laser pistol in his pocket ready to go in case Leroy tried anything.  
- The first AI we run into in the first room is clearly confused, mixing up our names with people we've never heard of and assuming we're with various organizations.
- Eventually it shuts down and we walk into the next room  
- We approach the wall and an area of darkness and an AI shouts "Halt!" at us and tells us not to move until we're verified by sentinels  
- They pop up a hand scanner to authenticate us and gets upset that we're not in the system.  We were eventually able to calm it down
- Elias walks into the area of darkness and Sal followed with my hand on his shoulder
- As they step through the curtain of darkness, each suddenly experiences that the other is not there and doesn't know where the other went?  
- We switch over to the other part of the party  
- Benny, Leon, Ryker, and Whiat take a people mover back to Welcome Center 3 using their visitor's badges  
- They plan to sign out a ship from the holding area
- There are three ships to choose from
	- a tiny mining ship
	- a beat up heavy frigate,
	- a research ship called the RV Aurora Parallax (Sal wants to rename it the Prometheus to tempt fate)  
- The RV Aurora Parallax was dropped off by [Sela Morane](Sela%20'Slate'%20Morvane%20-%20NPC.md),  Shipping Clerk for the Cignus Arc Cartel  
- Benny planned to steal a few crates along with the ship, but they officially sign out only the ship
- Back into the vault
- Elias walked into the darkness and Sal can't tell where he went, so Sal walked back out and talked to Nico.  
- Elias wanders around in the darkness for a while then fires his laser rifle into the darkness to no effect
- Elias takes a few steps backward and is back with the rest of the team
- Sal tries to hack the original hand scanner at the vault entrance while Elias explores the first big room  
- Elias discovered a crack in the wall with water leaking through it. Breaking through the crumbling wall Elias and Nico find the water dripping on the AI's computer core there causing it to short out periodically.
- All three focus on protecting the core from the water and are able to fix it, temporarily at least, so that the PCs can talk to it.
- They eventually convinced the AI into letting us open the vault and move stuff out to keep it safe from the water leak
- The AI wants us to take things out in "priority order"  
- The first thing is a 2 foot long box full of ancient voting records, we'll try to sell that to some archaeologists or something
